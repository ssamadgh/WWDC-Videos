[ Applause ]


2
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:25,976
>> Good afternoon.


3
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:27,876
Welcome to Session 304, What's


4
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:28,916
New in Device Management.


5
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:30,996
I'm Todd Fernandez and I'm very


6
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,356
pleased to be your host on this


7
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:33,846
tour through new developments


8
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,326
and how Apple devices can be


9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,796
managed in schools and


10
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:38,426
businesses around the world.


11
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,626
I just love this photo.


12
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:45,586
As Tim said on Monday, iPad has


13
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:47,806
changed the way we teach, learn


14
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:50,096
and create, which is why we work


15
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,276
so hard to make it easy to bring


16
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,936
Apple devices into schools so


17
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:56,456
that students like these girls


18
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:58,266
can do amazing things with their


19
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,546
iPads or Macs as the case may be


20
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:02,616
and get excited about learning


21
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:03,516
and creating.


22
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:07,186
We also want to unlock new


23
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:09,366
solutions in enterprise to help


24
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:10,956
employees be more productive and


25
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:13,156
enable businesses to create new


26
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,966
ways of serving their customers


27
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:17,046
by providing experiences in


28
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:19,096
their hotels, restaurants and


29
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:20,636
hospitals that were not


30
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:21,596
previously possible.


31
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:25,486
Last year, we introduced three


32
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,706
huge new device management


33
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,336
features to support iPad


34
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,536
deployments in schools.


35
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:33,036
Classroom, an assistant which


36
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,916
helps teachers focus on teaching


37
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:36,446
rather than managing student


38
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:37,096
devices.


39
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,486
Shared iPad, a great way to


40
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:42,716
provide a personalized


41
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,726
experience on an iPad shared by


42
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:46,666
many students each day in the


43
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,286
classroom.


44
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,666
And last but not least, Apple


45
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,736
School Manager, one place for


46
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:54,336
school IT administrators to


47
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:56,106
create and manage all of their


48
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:58,226
schools' accounts, devices and


49
00:01:58,226 --> 00:01:58,706
content.


50
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:04,486
Just like 2016, 2017 has already


51
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,036
been another big year for device


52
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:07,746
management as our releases


53
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,806
earlier this spring continued to


54
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:11,736
address the most important needs


55
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,466
in education and enterprise.


56
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,336
Introducing many more


57
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,106
capabilities to management via


58
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:19,866
MDM and configuration profiles.


59
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:23,626
Connecting Apple TV fully into


60
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:27,006
device management and conversely


61
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:28,086
removing the management


62
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,826
requirement for classroom by


63
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,296
empowering teachers to create


64
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,046
their own classes bringing


65
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:34,496
Classroom to a much wider


66
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:36,276
audience, including enabling


67
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,436
schools with bring your own


68
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,056
device programs around the


69
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:40,686
world, good day Australia, can


70
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,536
take advantage of Classroom.


71
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,626
But of course, we didn't stop


72
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:44,916
there.


73
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,986
Today we'll announce a number of


74
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:48,636
additional capabilities in each


75
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,536
of these areas to enable people


76
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,296
to make use of Apple devices in


77
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,486
new and exciting ways.


78
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:54,816
I don't want to spoil the


79
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:56,766
surprises so we'll cover each as


80
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,916
it comes up during today's


81
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:58,316
session.


82
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:02,186
As has become tradition, today's


83
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:03,476
session will follow deployment


84
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,926
lifecycle, beginning with


85
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,416
enrollment, getting your devices


86
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,476
ready to be managed.


87
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,346
Continuing with distribution,


88
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,676
loading those devices with


89
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:11,996
compelling apps and content.


90
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:14,216
Management, performing the


91
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,726
ongoing day-to-day management of


92
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:16,736
all of your devices.


93
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,636
And finally, I'll give a brief


94
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,516
update on Apple's tools for both


95
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:22,486
administrators and our MDM


96
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:24,016
solution partners which take


97
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,406
advantage of all of these new


98
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:25,996
features.


99
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:28,666
In a break from tradition, I


100
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:30,116
will mostly serve as an emcee


101
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,296
this year and leave the


102
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,726
presentation to the engineers


103
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,426
who have designed, built and


104
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:35,546
tested all of the new


105
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:36,636
capabilities we will cover


106
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:37,006
today.


107
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,136
We have so much to share I've


108
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,626
brought along a supporting cast


109
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,946
larger than the Game of Thrones,


110
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,606
well okay seven engineers, to


111
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:45,936
help me get through it all.


112
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:47,326
But I promise that we will


113
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,636
conclude in less time than it


114
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:49,546
takes the Oscars.


115
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,096
So, without further ado, I'd


116
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,486
like to ask Bob Whiteman to come


117
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,466
on stage and get us started by


118
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,786
telling you all about how we've


119
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:58,076
improved enrollment this year.


120
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:58,756
Bob.


121
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:04,686
[ Applause ]


122
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:05,986
>> Game of Thrones, will we make


123
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:07,106
it through the season, who


124
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:08,466
knows.


125
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,656
I'm Bob Whiteman, one of the


126
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:12,606
Apple engineers responsible for


127
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:13,536
the new device management


128
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:14,516
features you'll see today.


129
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:16,856
In this section, you'll find out


130
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,516
about major additions to Apple


131
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:20,966
TV management, new features of


132
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,196
the Device Enrollment Program,


133
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:24,836
security enhancements of the MDM


134
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,986
protocol, best practices for MDM


135
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,746
administrators and MDM server


136
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,996
developers, and a major update


137
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,016
to Apple School Manager.


138
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,326
First of Apple TV.


139
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,766
I'm happy to say that Apple TV


140
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,166
can now participate in the


141
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,486
Device Enrollment Program.


142
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,556
[ Applause ]


143
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:47,316
Apple TV devices have all the


144
00:04:47,316 --> 00:04:49,086
same features as iOS devices,


145
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,756
zero touch configuration,


146
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,946
streamline setup, and wireless


147
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:53,596
supervision.


148
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,596
You plug in power, an ethernet


149
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,426
and the device is automatically


150
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:00,226
configured, you don't even need


151
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:01,466
the remote.


152
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:04,626
There's also a change to the


153
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:06,106
supervision of Apple TVs,


154
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,036
previously all Apple TVs were


155
00:05:08,036 --> 00:05:10,386
treated as supervised now they


156
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,116
are unsupervised by default.


157
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:14,466
If you don't want the elevated


158
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:16,136
privileges of supervision you


159
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:19,196
don't need to claim them.


160
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,256
We've expanded the Device


161
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:22,716
Enrollment Program with a new


162
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,476
way to introduce devices into


163
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:25,146
the program.


164
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,966
Previously, DEP only supported


165
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,656
devices that were purchased from


166
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:30,826
a supported sales channel.


167
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,976
Now you can also enroll your own


168
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:36,616
devices in DEP regardless of how


169
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:37,426
you purchased them.


170
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:39,066
This will particularly help


171
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,566
schools that received donated


172
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:40,976
devices.


173
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:46,646
[ Applause ]


174
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,986
Now this new enrollment method


175
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:50,166
differs in two ways.


176
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,046
The first is that the device is


177
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:53,786
always supervised and MDM


178
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:55,876
management is always mandatory.


179
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,986
The second is a 30-day


180
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:01,866
provisional period, when you add


181
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,026
a device to DEP it erases the


182
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:04,616
device.


183
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:06,446
Then the provisional period


184
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,656
starts when the device is


185
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,116
subsequently activated.


186
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,356
During the provisional period


187
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,966
the lock screen and setup


188
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,646
assistant indicates the device


189
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:17,996
is provisionally enrolled and


190
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:19,816
the user can remove the device


191
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:22,146
from DEP and set up assistant or


192
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,576
settings, which also erases the


193
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:25,236
device.


194
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:27,946
But after the 30 days expire,


195
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,876
the user can no longer do so.


196
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:32,746
Both during and after the


197
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,966
provisional period all DEP


198
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,286
features are available,


199
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:38,676
including streamline setup and


200
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:40,006
mandatory MDM enrollment.


201
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,026
Now let's switch over to the


202
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:46,146
other DEP enrollment method.


203
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:48,356
When you add a device to DEP


204
00:06:48,636 --> 00:06:50,306
while purchasing the device from


205
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,466
an approved sales channel, the


206
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:53,666
device does not need to be


207
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,896
supervised and MDM management


208
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,736
can be optional, which lets the


209
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,686
user opt out of MDM management.


210
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:01,996
But only a vanishingly small


211
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,196
number of devices are in this


212
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:04,506
state and it was always kind of


213
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:07,196
an odd fit for DEP so we're


214
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:08,196
deprecating these.


215
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,256
In the future, all DEP enrolled


216
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:11,526
devices will need to be


217
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,546
supervised and MDM enrollment


218
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:14,576
will be mandatory.


219
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:18,866
And here's a little


220
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:20,306
housekeeping, with each new


221
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,106
release of iOS there are new


222
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,536
panes in the setup assistant.


223
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,586
DEP configuration allows you to


224
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:27,776
skip these panes, so these are


225
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:29,046
the new skip keys.


226
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:30,166
I won't go over each one of


227
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,376
these, but let me mention that


228
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,216
the keyboard user's pane only


229
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:37,286
appears on devices which are


230
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,216
non-US English regions, such as


231
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:39,906
China and Japan.


232
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,186
Moving on to some security


233
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:45,926
enhancements.


234
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:48,666
In iOS 10.3 we introduced


235
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,286
partial trust for manually


236
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:51,826
installed certificates and


237
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,116
certificate profiles.


238
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:55,266
When a certificate has partial


239
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,386
trust, it is trusted for all


240
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,966
purposes except SSL.


241
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,246
When a certificate is installed


242
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:03,276
noninteractively via MDM or


243
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,006
Configurator the certificate is


244
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,336
given full trust, but if it's


245
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:09,126
installed manually the


246
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:10,686
certificate gets partial trust


247
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:11,426
at first.


248
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,686
The user can go to Settings,


249
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,576
About, Certificate Trust


250
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,446
Settings and enable Full Trust


251
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:19,126
which gives an appropriate


252
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,006
additional warning.


253
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,866
Now this is a speedbump that


254
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,976
gets users to reconsider whether


255
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,666
they should trust whatever


256
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,326
certificate they have just been


257
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:29,546
asked to trust.


258
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:31,966
Often MDM enrollments require


259
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,226
trusting the MDM server


260
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:33,836
certificate.


261
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,226
To avoid complicating MDM


262
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:39,696
onboarding we put a small gap in


263
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:40,405
the speedbump.


264
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,525
If the certificate is manually


265
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:45,316
installed by a profile that also


266
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,416
contains an MDM payload that


267
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,316
certificate is given full trust.


268
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,526
So, if your MDM deployment


269
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,946
requires trust, make sure you're


270
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,626
distributing the certificate in


271
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,456
the same profile as the MDM


272
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,386
enrollment payload to make sure


273
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:02,366
that you're driving your users


274
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:03,396
through that gap in the


275
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:03,866
speedbump.


276
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,886
In 2018, MDM will require your


277
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:12,766
server to support App Transport


278
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,916
Security or ATS.


279
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:16,606
This is a set of security


280
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,246
requirements for secure


281
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:19,756
communication introduced


282
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:20,256
previously.


283
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,966
ATS requires specific protocol


284
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,716
details and cryptographic


285
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,226
algorithms to harden secure


286
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:27,126
communications.


287
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:30,366
For now, MDM is exempted from


288
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:32,396
ATS, but this exemption will be


289
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,016
ending in 2018.


290
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,086
If your MDM server does not


291
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:38,626
currently meet ATS requirements


292
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:40,006
in the future the MDM client


293
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,826
will refuse to communicate with


294
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:41,896
it.


295
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,006
But regardless of that, the time


296
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,596
to update your MDM server is


297
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:45,916
now.


298
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,946
After all, these changes are a


299
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,576
good idea for security, whether


300
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,766
or not the device requires them.


301
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,916
MDM enrollment involves a SCEP


302
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,566
server to generate the device


303
00:09:59,566 --> 00:09:59,966
identity.


304
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,156
This involves negotiating the


305
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:04,456
cryptographic algorithms used


306
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:05,646
for encryption and hashing.


307
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:07,876
We've dropped support for the


308
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:09,466
outdated DES algorithm.


309
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,996
And make sure you SCEP server


310
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,776
advertises its capabilities


311
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,786
properly in the CA Caps field.


312
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:18,716
A couple of MDM servers out


313
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:21,086
there didn't and that forced the


314
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,846
MDM client to fall back to the


315
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:24,446
lowest quality algorithm triple


316
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:26,216
DES even though the SCEP servers


317
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,386
in question supported better


318
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,026
algorithms.


319
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:30,976
And on that note, add support


320
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:32,456
for the best algorithms which


321
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:33,876
are currently AES for bulk


322
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,616
encryption and SHA-512 for


323
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:35,966
hashing.


324
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:41,396
On the macOS side, we've


325
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:42,566
hardened the server certificate


326
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,466
evaluation for MDM communication


327
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:45,326
in High Sierra.


328
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,866
This involves three new keys in


329
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:49,236
the MDM enrollment payload.


330
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,796
The first two keys specify white


331
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,476
lists of certificates to use


332
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,606
when evaluating server trust.


333
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:57,816
One set for the server URL and


334
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,226
the other for the checking URL.


335
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:02,616
The third key specifies hard or


336
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,516
soft revocation checking on


337
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:05,966
those pinned certificates.


338
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,996
Hard revocation checking means


339
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:10,256
that the trust evaluation fails


340
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,086
if the device cannot get a


341
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:13,286
positive response from the


342
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:15,176
revocation server for any


343
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:15,536
reason.


344
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,256
Now these are generally good


345
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:19,596
security features for securing


346
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,846
communications, but if you're


347
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:24,246
only administrating Macs this


348
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,556
can be particularly useful it


349
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,306
can save you the cost and effort


350
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:29,536
of getting a certificate for a


351
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:30,146
public CA.


352
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:33,046
Just remember to be particularly


353
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:34,506
careful when rolling out these


354
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,296
features, especially pinning the


355
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,706
server URL certificate.


356
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,416
A misconfiguration could cut off


357
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,626
your Macs from communicating


358
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:43,246
with your MDM server which makes


359
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,576
it very difficult to correct the


360
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:45,476
misconfiguration.


361
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:50,366
I'd like to share some best


362
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,226
practices for administrators.


363
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,226
For those administering Shared


364
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:57,056
iPad, please enable diagnostic


365
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,866
submission using the diagnostic


366
00:11:58,866 --> 00:11:59,766
submission command.


367
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,666
This lets us collect the raw


368
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,236
data that we need in order to


369
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,626
help us improve the product for


370
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:05,096
everyone.


371
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:09,576
Also for Shared iPad there's an


372
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,226
interaction between the user


373
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:13,766
quota setting and the APFS file


374
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:14,206
system.


375
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,296
A user quota controls two


376
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:17,086
different things.


377
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:18,816
It sets a maximum number of


378
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,386
users that can have data stored


379
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:23,826
on the device and it ensures


380
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,316
that individual users aren't


381
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:26,876
consuming too much file system


382
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,596
space which would crowd out


383
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:29,386
other users.


384
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:31,716
If you already have Shared iPad


385
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,886
devices with the user quota that


386
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,306
second control of storage space


387
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,266
is effectively disabled by the


388
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:40,256
upgrade that APFS introduced in


389
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,486
iOS 10.3.


390
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:43,176
There's a one-time


391
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,176
administration task to restore


392
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:46,226
the storage quote.


393
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,246
Upgrade to the latest iOS and


394
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:51,816
wipe all of the existing user


395
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,026
counts on the iPad.


396
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:54,426
You can either erase the iPad


397
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:56,566
and set it up again or use the


398
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:57,656
delete user command.


399
00:12:58,446 --> 00:12:59,806
And don't forget to shut down


400
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:01,306
the iPad after you're done so


401
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:02,216
that it's ready to go when the


402
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:02,976
users first get it.


403
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:08,276
If you're using startup profiles


404
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:10,126
on macOS you've been putting the


405
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:11,996
profiles in a special location


406
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:13,526
in the file system this is now


407
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,326
deprecated.


408
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:16,526
Instead, there's a new option to


409
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:18,326
the profiles command line tool


410
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:19,816
that lets you specify startup


411
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,406
profiles, the details are in the


412
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,796
main page for the profiles


413
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:22,976
command.


414
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:28,286
And now some best practices for


415
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:28,976
those of you that are


416
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,706
implementing MDM servers.


417
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:32,376
I just mentioned how useful the


418
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,176
diagnostic submission command


419
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,776
is, so please make sure that


420
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:36,786
your server supports it.


421
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:42,786
In 2018, APNs tokens will likely


422
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,666
increase in size, verify that


423
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,496
your server can handle APNs


424
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:48,656
tokens up to 100 bytes in size.


425
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:50,596
Don't just hardcode the size of


426
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,736
APNs tokens that you've been


427
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:52,946
receiving from devices.


428
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,536
When the MDM server generates


429
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,356
its enrollment profile limit it


430
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,436
to just the MDM payload and


431
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:04,226
payloads necessary to ensure


432
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:05,656
that the enrollment succeeds,


433
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,936
such as Wi-Fi payload or


434
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:08,946
certificate payload.


435
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,196
Don't use this profile to


436
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:12,736
configure other things like


437
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,286
restrictions or accounts,


438
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:15,856
instead push those payloads


439
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,346
after the enrollment completes.


440
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:22,286
And last, I'd like to challenge


441
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,346
MDM solution providers to make


442
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,916
the life of an administrator


443
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:26,456
easier.


444
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,036
Device management provides a


445
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:29,866
large number of individual


446
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,866
controls and we're adding more


447
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,296
with each new release.


448
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:34,916
This makes device management


449
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:37,256
powerful, but complex.


450
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,496
Administrators may not know all


451
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:40,566
of the details of how these


452
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,566
controls interact and that


453
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:43,476
raises the risk of a


454
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:44,386
misconfiguration.


455
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:47,346
For instance, an administrator


456
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,376
may restrict the App Store to


457
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,596
prevent unauthorized apps, but


458
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:52,686
not realize that they should


459
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,796
also restrict pairings so that


460
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,026
apps can't be installed with


461
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,536
Configurator or iTunes.


462
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,246
So, do what you can in both


463
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:02,966
documentation and software to


464
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,096
meet administrator's needs, not


465
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:05,976
just allow them to set settings.


466
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:12,756
If you're troubleshooting device


467
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:14,156
management problems I have some


468
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:15,046
tips for that.


469
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,506
Your best source of information


470
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:17,616
is the system logs.


471
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:19,336
You can view them with the macOS


472
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,216
apps Console or Apple


473
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,046
Configurator 2.


474
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:25,266
On iOS, filter the logs by


475
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,136
process name to hone in on the


476
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,596
most useful messages.


477
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:31,376
Profiling is responsible for


478
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:32,426
installation and removal of


479
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,956
profiles and restrictions and


480
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:34,436
other things.


481
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:37,386
MDM is responsible for


482
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,726
communicating with the MDM


483
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,736
server and tracking management


484
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:42,916
of apps, systems and accounts.


485
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,016
If you have a device that's not


486
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:46,106
communicating with the MDM


487
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:50,336
server you want to examine mdmd.


488
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:52,696
DMD relays management commands


489
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,996
to other parts of the operating


490
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:54,456
system.


491
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,556
And appstored installs and


492
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,346
removes apps and if those apps


493
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:02,456
come from iTunes itunesstored is


494
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:03,186
involved as well.


495
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,226
So, when you're looking through


496
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,816
the logs your best bet is to


497
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:08,646
look for log messages of error


498
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,496
type first and if nothing jumps


499
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:12,136
out at you look at the warning


500
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,366
level as well.


501
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:17,376
On macOS, don't filter the logs


502
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:19,756
by process instead, filter the


503
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:21,266
logs by setting the subsystem to


504
00:16:21,336 --> 00:16:24,416
com.apple.ManagedClient which


505
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,606
covers all appropriate


506
00:16:25,606 --> 00:16:26,306
processes.


507
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:28,496
But for both operating systems


508
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,466
you may want to install a debug


509
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,216
logging profile to get more


510
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,256
detailed information.


511
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,966
Just remember the caveats


512
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,296
involved when using debug


513
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:36,706
logging.


514
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,526
For instance, don't habitually


515
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,346
push the logging profiles to all


516
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,706
the devices in your population.


517
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:43,866
If you have any troubleshooting


518
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,806
questions make sure to come to


519
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:46,646
the lab sessions.


520
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:48,786
And now I'm going to turn it


521
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:50,996
over to my colleagues, Can Aran


522
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:52,616
and Juan [inaudible] to demo


523
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:54,346
some of these.


524
00:16:55,746 --> 00:16:56,436
Can.


525
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,500
[ Applause ]


526
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:06,675
>> Hello, I'm Can Aran, iOS


527
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:07,675
engineer in the device


528
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,455
management team and I must say


529
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:12,016
I'm very excited to be here.


530
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,136
I will be using Configurator,


531
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:17,215
Apple Configurator 2 to enroll


532
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:20,126
this device and let's get


533
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,786
started with that.


534
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:23,915
I'll choose the device,


535
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,195
right-click on it and hit


536
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:28,205
Prepare.


537
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,456
In the new version of


538
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,216
Configurator, we have this


539
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:34,246
option to add the device to


540
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:36,216
Device Enrollment Program, so


541
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:38,586
we'll check that and hit Next.


542
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,596
Just a quick note, I had already


543
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,366
logged in to my DP Organization


544
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,056
Configurator prompted me for


545
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:48,586
that and saved my credentials.


546
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:51,806
Here we can specify our MDM


547
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:54,926
server, we can enter our


548
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:59,926
organization information, and we


549
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,466
can skip these steps in Setup


550
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:05,406
Assistant and we will need to


551
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:08,316
provide a Wi-Fi profile for the


552
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:09,926
device to be able to communicate


553
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:10,536
with the server.


554
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:16,096
And we may enter our credentials


555
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,966
for the MDM server, but we do


556
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,076
not need to for now.


557
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,926
So, once I hit Prepare here


558
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:25,646
device will get added to DEP and


559
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,816
after that it will erase itself


560
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,566
which will take some time to


561
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,106
land on Setup Assistant.


562
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,176
So, for the sake of our time


563
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:38,146
we'll use another device to go


564
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:39,276
through Setup Assistant.


565
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,406
This device is already added to


566
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:42,766
DEP beforehand.


567
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:48,666
So, let's hit Prepare and switch


568
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,966
to the other device.


569
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:00,556
All right.


570
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,506
So, we have a new pane for


571
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,136
Device Enrollment now it's


572
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:06,616
called Remote Management, can


573
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:07,986
see the details about what


574
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:10,336
Remote Management does here and


575
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:13,266
also, we can remove the device


576
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,816
from DEP by just clicking on


577
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:17,316
Leave Remote Management button.


578
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,746
This button will appear in the


579
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:23,396
first 30 days of enrollments as


580
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,686
my colleague Bob said.


581
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,846
Once we hit that it will remove


582
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:30,786
the device from DEP.


583
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:40,706
Also, this button is there


584
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:42,586
because we would like to protect


585
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:45,916
our users, we don't want our


586
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,816
users' devices to get added to


587
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:50,186
DEP without their consent or


588
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:50,916
accidentally.


589
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:54,036
So, let's apply the


590
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:57,866
configuration by hitting Next


591
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:00,196
and let's enter our secret


592
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:02,976
credentials for the MDM server.


593
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,356
And let's read the terms and


594
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,436
conditions as I know every one


595
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:16,976
of you do.


596
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,106
And that's it device has the


597
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,556
configuration that has been


598
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:29,126
specified by the MDM server and


599
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:32,416
it's been added to DEP just as


600
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,406
if it was purchased from a


601
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:35,716
supported sales channel.


602
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,056
So regardless of how the device


603
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:42,606
is purchased it can be added to


604
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:43,716
DEP now.


605
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:44,806
Now that I have enrolled my


606
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:47,306
device I would like to invite my


607
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,056
colleague Juan [inaudible] to


608
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:51,146
stage to show you how this


609
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,906
connects to Apple School Manager


610
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:53,186
world.


611
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:53,876
Thank you.


612
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:58,500
[ Applause ]


613
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:03,646
>> Thank you Can.


614
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,866
Hi, my name is Juan [inaudible]


615
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:08,206
and I'm the UI Manager for Apple


616
00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:08,706
School.


617
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:10,936
And today I'm really proud to


618
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,206
show you the latest version that


619
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,926
came out of preview on May 17.


620
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,046
But for those that are not


621
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,306
familiar with Apple School what


622
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:18,906
is Apple School?


623
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:21,046
Apple School is your one


624
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,016
destination for your institution


625
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,806
to manage your devices,


626
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,206
accounts, and content.


627
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,326
So, these are some of the new


628
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,856
features that came out in the


629
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:35,816
latest release.


630
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,956
We have a new streamlined user


631
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:41,566
interface, the ability to create


632
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,566
up to five administrators and


633
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:44,726
support for PowerSchool.


634
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:46,976
But nothing better than a demo


635
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:49,236
to show you our new streamlined


636
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,356
user interface.


637
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,986
Today I'm going to be an


638
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,576
administrator at my organization


639
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:59,706
and I'm going to start talking


640
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:02,636
to you guys about managing


641
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:03,786
devices.


642
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:08,016
Can just enrolled two devices to


643
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:10,336
the DEP program and you can see


644
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:12,066
the two devices up here on


645
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,296
devices added by Apple


646
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:14,166
Configurator 2.


647
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:18,026
And we just realized that I


648
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,546
should have assigned one of


649
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,756
those devices to this MDM server


650
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,356
in a different location.


651
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:27,766
So, let's do that.


652
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:31,486
I'm going to search for my


653
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:36,916
device, here is the last iPad


654
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,446
that he added to the DEP


655
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:38,826
program.


656
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:40,396
And I'm just going to switch it


657
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:41,906
to Abraham Lincoln Elementary,


658
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:45,316
click Done and now I'm ready to


659
00:22:45,476 --> 00:22:47,546
wipe that device and the next


660
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:49,226
time it boots up it's ready to


661
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:51,376
start to be managed by his new


662
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,266
MDM server.


663
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:56,106
Now let's talk about managing


664
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:56,876
your accounts.


665
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:00,566
So, imagine the following


666
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,336
scenario, it's the beginning of


667
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:05,086
the school year in at Abraham


668
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,266
Lincoln Elementary and we have a


669
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:09,576
new group of students, of


670
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:10,346
first-graders.


671
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,406
So, we need to create new


672
00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:15,036
credentials for these students.


673
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,826
So, let's do that.


674
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:21,066
I'm going to navigate to


675
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,526
locations, here's my elementary


676
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:26,436
school, now I want to see the


677
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:27,666
accounts related to this school.


678
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,946
Notice that my filtering UI is


679
00:23:30,946 --> 00:23:31,576
now visible.


680
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,846
Now I just need to add a couple


681
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:40,026
filters, I want my students and


682
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:40,976
my first-graders.


683
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:45,476
As you can tell, I've been


684
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:47,336
changing -- the search results


685
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:49,146
have changed and there's this


686
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,366
first row that allows me to


687
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:52,206
select all the students in this


688
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:52,526
filter.


689
00:23:53,026 --> 00:23:57,116
On your right, you can see


690
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:58,916
several different bulk actions


691
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,486
that I can execute as an


692
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,036
administrator.


693
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,086
Now let's create a sign-in sheet


694
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:06,056
for these students.


695
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:08,036
You might be wondering why a


696
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:09,906
sign-in sheet, well it turns out


697
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,256
that most first-graders don't


698
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,646
have a phone number or an e-mail


699
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:15,656
address so we need this


700
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,516
alternative method to distribute


701
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:18,066
the credentials.


702
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:19,666
So, let's do that.


703
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,376
All right, I select Create, a


704
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:25,716
create a downloadable PDF and


705
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:28,646
CSV and this starts a process


706
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:29,606
that we call Activity.


707
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,746
An Activity it's a way to track


708
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:34,876
background processes or


709
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:35,976
long-running jobs.


710
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,166
Now I just jump to the Activity


711
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:46,276
path and you can see here the


712
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,856
creation of the sign-in sheet.


713
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:50,336
As you can tell, I've been very


714
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:51,866
busy today, it's the first day


715
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,546
of the school so I had to delete


716
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:55,996
some accounts, create sign-I


717
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,476
sheets for other students,


718
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:59,426
change the password policy of


719
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:02,276
some accounts, add new roles,


720
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:05,296
and also I had some problems


721
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,676
with some of the operations.


722
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:09,476
This also allows us to be able


723
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:12,476
to be able to notice any


724
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:13,796
problems that we have to our


725
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,136
process of administrating.


726
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:18,826
Creating our new sign-in sheets


727
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:19,516
is almost over.


728
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:23,646
So, I'm just going to wait for a


729
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:23,976
second.


730
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,506
Now I'm ready to download that


731
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:29,946
sign-in sheet.


732
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,786
So, I wanted it in an 8-up PDF


733
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:33,936
format because I want to save


734
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:34,466
some paper.


735
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:41,496
I download it and here is the


736
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,686
sign-in sheet for my new


737
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:42,976
students.


738
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:51,726
So that was easy.


739
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:53,946
Now let's talk about managing


740
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:55,366
your content.


741
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,936
Currently, I can navigate to


742
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:01,336
Apps and Books and here I'm


743
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:03,186
presented to a link that will


744
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,546
take me to the Volume Purchase


745
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:04,946
Program.


746
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:07,516
In the Volume Purchase Program


747
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:09,316
website, you will be able to


748
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:11,646
purchase applications and iBooks


749
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:12,176
in bulk.


750
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:15,296
I'm really happy to announce


751
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:19,076
today that we are working on


752
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:20,676
integrating the Volume Purchase


753
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:23,716
Program into Apple School and


754
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,006
it's coming before the end of


755
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:27,436
the year.


756
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:28,566
Now let's look what it looks


757
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:28,826
like.


758
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:33,776
Here's a screenshot that is


759
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:35,816
showing you the inventory of


760
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:38,366
applications of all devices that


761
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:40,596
you have purchased for the Apple


762
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:41,276
School district.


763
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:42,746
You see the ones that are


764
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:44,346
available, all the ones that are


765
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:44,896
in use.


766
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:48,196
And then in this next screen you


767
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:49,256
are seeing that I'm trying to


768
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,486
purchase an iBook, 50 licenses


769
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,096
of it and assigning them to


770
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:53,956
Covington Charter School.


771
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:00,816
Now let's have Todd talk to you


772
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:02,636
more about the details of this


773
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:03,976
new distribution model.


774
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:09,546
[ Applause ]


775
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,446
>> Thank you very much Juan.


776
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:12,546
As some of you may have noticed,


777
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:13,786
we've now included the


778
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:14,936
enrollment section and moved


779
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:16,136
into distribution now that we're


780
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,276
talking about volume purchase.


781
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:19,926
However, I wanted to reiterate


782
00:27:19,926 --> 00:27:21,456
that the new Leave Remote


783
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:22,666
Management button at the bottom


784
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,006
of the new Remote Management


785
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,506
pane in Setup Assistant only


786
00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:27,916
appears during that 30-day


787
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,596
provisional period after adding


788
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:30,896
devices to the Device Enrollment


789
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:32,186
Program using the new feature


790
00:27:32,186 --> 00:27:33,006
that Can demoed.


791
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:34,816
Devices that have been added by


792
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:36,226
purchasing directly from Apple


793
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:37,966
or through a reseller which


794
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,276
supports the Device Enrollment


795
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:40,956
Program there's no change and


796
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:41,956
that button will not appear.


797
00:27:47,046 --> 00:27:47,756
So, we have a short agenda for


798
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:49,076
distribution, but it's a really


799
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:50,926
big topic upfront Volume


800
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:51,896
Purchase Program fully


801
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:52,986
integrated into Apple School


802
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:53,466
Manager.


803
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,156
And I will go into a bit more


804
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,946
detail and cover a few


805
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:59,876
additional features and a brief


806
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:01,786
update about changes to


807
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:03,356
installing apps and managing


808
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:04,526
them on tvOS.


809
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:07,926
So, Juan has already shown you


810
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:09,616
the beautiful new updated UI in


811
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:10,916
Apple School Manager which went


812
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,656
live last month, as well as a


813
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,776
sneak peek into how Volume


814
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,056
Purchase Program will look once


815
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:18,466
it's integrated into it.


816
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:19,816
We are also making it much


817
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:20,986
easier to manage multiple


818
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:22,886
locations, tokens, and licenses


819
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:24,056
within an organization,


820
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,596
including supporting


821
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:28,056
transferring licenses between


822
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:30,306
locations so that your content


823
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,486
managers no longer will need to


824
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:32,436
share credentials.


825
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,956
All of this will be available


826
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:36,856
very soon as Juan mentioned, but


827
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:38,236
there is a bit of work for MDM


828
00:28:38,236 --> 00:28:39,986
vendors to do to support license


829
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:41,406
transfer in particular, which


830
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:42,366
again I'll cover today.


831
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:45,866
So, for a long time we've heard


832
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:47,406
some customer feedback around


833
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:48,796
the difficulty in managing


834
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,546
multiple VPP accounts so we


835
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:52,276
wanted to make it much easier


836
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:53,406
for schools to organize their


837
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:54,966
purchases and manage them in an


838
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,686
intuitive way that matches their


839
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:57,826
organizational structure.


840
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:01,636
So, with these updates purchases


841
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:02,846
are now associated with a


842
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:04,326
location rather than the


843
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,936
personal inventory of individual


844
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:06,886
content managers.


845
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,526
Multiple content managers can


846
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:11,356
purchase apps and books for a


847
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:14,056
single location and all licenses


848
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,086
for that location will be


849
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,416
managed with a single token.


850
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,206
So, there's no longer a need for


851
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:20,676
a token per content manager.


852
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:24,086
Each content manager through


853
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:25,476
that token can then manage all


854
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:26,946
licenses that are associated


855
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:28,786
with that location, meaning that


856
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,746
if a content manager leaves any


857
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:31,916
other content manager can


858
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,256
continue to manage all of those


859
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:33,896
licenses.


860
00:29:36,186 --> 00:29:37,426
Just illustrate this with a


861
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:38,526
simple animation.


862
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,676
Now I have two different content


863
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:40,906
managers each of them buying


864
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,736
some apps and buying some books.


865
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,966
There's a token that either one


866
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:46,516
of those managers can download


867
00:29:46,656 --> 00:29:48,476
from the Volume Purchase Program


868
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,526
and upload to their MDM server


869
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:52,096
to allow it to manage those


870
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,026
licenses and assign them to


871
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,136
users and devices.


872
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:58,526
Another bit of feedback we've


873
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:00,696
gotten is the request to be able


874
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:02,176
to transfer licenses that were


875
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,866
purchased in one area to a


876
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:05,676
different area.


877
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:07,376
And so, we have now added


878
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:08,566
support for transferring


879
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:10,216
licenses between locations which


880
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,346
are now tracked with a single


881
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:12,806
token.


882
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,456
Apple School Manager of course


883
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:17,426
will show the accurate number of


884
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:18,796
available licenses at each


885
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:20,456
location as these transfers take


886
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:20,926
place.


887
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:23,546
Any licenses which are currently


888
00:30:23,546 --> 00:30:24,946
available and not assigned can


889
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,226
be transferred at any time.


890
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:27,876
But if they're licenses that are


891
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,416
already assigned to a user or


892
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:30,866
device those can't be


893
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,106
transferred because of course,


894
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:33,406
those users and devices are


895
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:34,786
associated with that location as


896
00:30:34,786 --> 00:30:36,056
well and it would disrupt your


897
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:36,616
deployment.


898
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:38,406
So, if you do want to actually


899
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:39,886
transfer those licenses you can


900
00:30:39,886 --> 00:30:41,456
revoke them, the current


901
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:42,706
assignment, making them


902
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:43,706
available for transfer.


903
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:47,456
And simple animation we've got


904
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:49,056
two locations each represented


905
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,836
with its token to manage their


906
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,106
apps and books and we can


907
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:54,976
transfer apps from one location


908
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:55,656
to the other.


909
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,656
And each location continues to


910
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:02,076
be managing those licenses, so


911
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,226
if location one is at one MDM


912
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:06,466
server, location two another MDM


913
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:07,926
server they can continue to


914
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:09,866
manage the appropriate app and


915
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:10,746
book licenses.


916
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:14,306
Another sneak peek, this is what


917
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,286
it will look like once it's


918
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,216
integrated in Apple School


919
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:18,166
Manager showing you for each app


920
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,526
that you've purchased the


921
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:22,386
licenses for each location and


922
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:23,576
making it very easy to then


923
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,076
select the location and transfer


924
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,196
some of those licenses to


925
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:26,546
another.


926
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:30,666
So, now I'd like to highlight


927
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,126
what we need and our MDM


928
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,316
partners to do to support


929
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:34,776
license transfer and these new


930
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:35,236
features.


931
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:37,296
So, the first is now that a


932
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,106
location and token have a


933
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,126
one-to-one relationship as


934
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:42,536
tokens expire or otherwise


935
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:43,726
become invalid it's going to be


936
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:45,016
important to make it easy for


937
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,616
admins to identify which token


938
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:48,546
needs renewal by making clear


939
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,866
which location this token is


940
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,156
for.


941
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:52,186
And our API calls that you're


942
00:31:52,186 --> 00:31:54,576
already using to get information


943
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,076
about the Volume Purchase


944
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:57,576
Program have now been enhanced


945
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:58,826
to provide that information to


946
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,606
you so that you can update your


947
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:01,336
UI appropriately.


948
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:04,646
Now that multiple content


949
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:06,166
managers can download the same


950
00:32:06,206 --> 00:32:08,366
token for a location you need to


951
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:10,336
also be prepared for a content


952
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,146
manager to inadvertently upload


953
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:13,716
a duplicate token and handle


954
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:14,926
that appropriately so that you


955
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:16,286
don't duplicate the license


956
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:18,256
count.


957
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:20,136
Similarly, now licenses can be


958
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,426
transferred outside of your MDM


959
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:24,016
server's knowledge in Apple


960
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:24,726
School Manager.


961
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,276
So, you need to be prepared to


962
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:27,796
refresh your license counts when


963
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:28,776
you update your UI.


964
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:34,186
Finally, when is this all


965
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:34,476
coming?


966
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:35,726
We're working hard on preparing


967
00:32:35,726 --> 00:32:37,066
the documentation update, as


968
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,386
well as testing support which


969
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:40,206
will be available soon and


970
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:41,656
releasing later this summer so


971
00:32:41,656 --> 00:32:43,346
that you can help us and our


972
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:44,776
joint customers in schools be


973
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:45,856
ready for back-to-school


974
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:46,316
deployment.


975
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:50,916
That concludes our section on


976
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:52,746
Volume Purchase Program and now


977
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:54,006
I'd like to do a couple of


978
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,186
updates on tvOS.


979
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:57,116
It's now possible to install


980
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:59,556
enterprise apps on tvOS, as well


981
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:01,246
as manage them using Managed App


982
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,076
Configuration.


983
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,396
A great feature that we've had


984
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,266
in iOS for a number of years is


985
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,036
now available in tvOS as well to


986
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:09,346
configure your apps after you


987
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:10,166
deploy them.


988
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:13,286
And that brings us to the end of


989
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:14,866
our distribution section, so I'd


990
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:16,146
like to ask Pradhap to come up


991
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:17,316
on stage and take you through


992
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:18,186
the management section.


993
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:18,966
Pradhap.


994
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:22,546
[ Applause ]


995
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:23,446
>> Thank you Todd.


996
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:25,896
Hello everyone, good afternoon.


997
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:28,086
I'm very excited to be here to


998
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:29,216
walk you through all the great


999
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,736
management features that we


1000
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:32,436
added since we met the last


1001
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:32,626
year.


1002
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,826
First, let's get started with


1003
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:35,726
iOS.


1004
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:38,806
Preparing a large number of iOS


1005
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:40,476
devices, especially with a lot


1006
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,316
of apps and books using a Wi-Fi


1007
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:43,866
network has always been a


1008
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:44,446
challenge.


1009
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,216
It makes a Wi-Fi network


1010
00:33:46,216 --> 00:33:47,946
unusable and more often,


1011
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:49,376
administrators had to set up a


1012
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:51,146
dedicated Wi-Fi network just for


1013
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:52,196
preparing devices.


1014
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:54,756
To solve this, we added a new


1015
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,516
option to all the MDM commands


1016
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:58,196
using which the administrator


1017
00:33:58,196 --> 00:33:59,976
can specify that the device has


1018
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:01,196
to be connected to a wired


1019
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:03,186
network like Internet sharing or


1020
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:05,626
USB or an ethernet connection to


1021
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,526
perform a command.


1022
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:09,176
This combined with content


1023
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:10,755
cashing on macOS is going to


1024
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,146
significantly improve the setup


1025
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:13,856
experience for iOS devices.


1026
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,686
MDM already has the ability to


1027
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:21,286
install software updates on DEP


1028
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:23,065
devices without a passcode.


1029
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:24,876
We improved that and added


1030
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,585
support for passcode lock


1031
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:29,755
devices and supervised non-DEP


1032
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:32,356
devices as well.


1033
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:34,565
We realize that in most cases


1034
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:35,985
when a device with an app or


1035
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,666
[inaudible] is erased the data


1036
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:38,996
plan shouldn't be erased as


1037
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:40,606
well, so we added an option to


1038
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:42,335
the erase device command to


1039
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:43,786
specify the data plan


1040
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:44,436
preference.


1041
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:47,156
Before I move on I would like to


1042
00:34:47,156 --> 00:34:48,856
point out that the features that


1043
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:50,196
are marked with the new badge


1044
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:51,985
are new in the upcoming iOS


1045
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:53,346
releases that we announced in


1046
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:55,326
[inaudible] this week and all


1047
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,666
the other features [inaudible]


1048
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:57,616
earlier this year.


1049
00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:00,316
And also, if you see a new badge


1050
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:01,526
on the upper right corner of the


1051
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,336
slide everything on that slide


1052
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:05,176
is new.


1053
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,186
Next, let's talk about Lost and


1054
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:07,486
Found.


1055
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:10,536
All the users love our devices,


1056
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:11,846
but sometimes they go missing.


1057
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,736
MDM already supports putting a


1058
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:17,496
device in loss mode and also


1059
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:19,096
query the location of the device


1060
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,426
when the device is in lost mode.


1061
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:23,786
We also added support to play a


1062
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:25,296
sound when the device is in lost


1063
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:25,536
mode.


1064
00:35:26,796 --> 00:35:28,346
And we updated the device


1065
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:30,306
location query to include all


1066
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,126
the location attributes that you


1067
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:33,546
would expect from a location


1068
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:33,826
APA.


1069
00:35:34,286 --> 00:35:37,726
Like devices apps go missing as


1070
00:35:37,726 --> 00:35:39,246
well, so we added a new


1071
00:35:39,246 --> 00:35:41,556
restriction to prevent users


1072
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,716
from deleting system apps


1073
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:45,366
accidentally on their device.


1074
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,576
This is especially great for


1075
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:49,606
shard use devices where the App


1076
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,706
Store may be disabled.


1077
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:55,426
We continuously add new features


1078
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:57,176
to help enterprises keep their


1079
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:57,956
data safe.


1080
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,586
Starting with iOS 10.3


1081
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:02,426
administrators can restrict the


1082
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,716
list of Wi-Fi networks that the


1083
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:05,746
device can join to just the


1084
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,676
Wi-Fi networks that are


1085
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:08,426
configured by MDM or our


1086
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:09,776
configuration profiles.


1087
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:13,236
Thank you.


1088
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,846
And starting with iOS 11 the


1089
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,536
Wi-Fi restriction exempts


1090
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:19,596
carrier profiles.


1091
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:22,186
We recommend that you push the


1092
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:24,606
Wi-Fi restriction together or


1093
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:25,876
after the Wi-Fi payload,


1094
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:27,606
otherwise you run the risk of


1095
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,566
devices losing connectivity to


1096
00:36:31,216 --> 00:36:32,236
MDM server.


1097
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:33,896
We also added a new restriction


1098
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,826
to disable users from creating


1099
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,616
their own VPN configurations.


1100
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:41,176
MDM already supports


1101
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,866
configuring, signing and


1102
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,286
encryption identities for


1103
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,796
exchange and mail, but there was


1104
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:47,916
only one global switch to turn


1105
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:49,436
both signing and encryption on


1106
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:49,816
or off.


1107
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:52,156
We improved that and added a new


1108
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:53,536
key so that you can control


1109
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:54,516
signing and encryption


1110
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:55,296
independently.


1111
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:59,696
We added three new restrictions


1112
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:01,486
to Classroom to make the


1113
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,106
expedience of unmanaged classes


1114
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:06,356
on supervised devices on par


1115
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:07,596
with managed classes.


1116
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:10,416
The first new restrictions


1117
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:12,346
enables an instructor to observe


1118
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:14,936
a student's screen and perform


1119
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:17,336
an app or a device log without


1120
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,156
prompting the students just like


1121
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,146
managed classes.


1122
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,406
And the last one causes the


1123
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,026
students to automatically join


1124
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:25,886
classes without prompting them


1125
00:37:25,886 --> 00:37:27,056
every time.


1126
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:30,836
With iOS 11 we made a lot of


1127
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:31,996
improvements to the AirPrint


1128
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:32,406
payload.


1129
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:34,246
The AirPrint payload now


1130
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:36,676
supports configuring custom port


1131
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,836
and also specify whether TLS is


1132
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:41,336
required on a per app and


1133
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:42,476
destination basis.


1134
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,656
In addition to the improvements


1135
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:46,396
to the payload we also added


1136
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:48,136
four new restrictions to


1137
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,496
configure global AirPrint


1138
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:50,146
options.


1139
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,886
The first restriction can be


1140
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:53,996
used to disable iBeacon


1141
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:55,876
discovery of AirPrint printers.


1142
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,026
And the second one can be used


1143
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,796
to disable storage of AirPrint


1144
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:01,076
credentials in Keychain.


1145
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:06,676
You can also require TLS for all


1146
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:07,736
AirPrint connections on a


1147
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:08,296
device.


1148
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:10,306
And finally, you can disable


1149
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,896
AirPrint completely on a device


1150
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:15,026
if you have to do so.


1151
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:17,016
As you may have heard earlier


1152
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:19,686
this week, iOS 11 supports a new


1153
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:21,726
extension using which apps can


1154
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:24,316
provide a DNS proxy and we added


1155
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:25,726
a payload just to configure


1156
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:26,076
that.


1157
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,656
The new DNS proxy extension


1158
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:30,266
payload can be used to configure


1159
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,366
the bundle ID of the extension


1160
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:34,316
that should be used as DNS proxy


1161
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:36,716
and also provide any custom


1162
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:38,236
configuration that the extension


1163
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:39,266
might need.


1164
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:42,016
The cellular payload now


1165
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:43,496
supports configuring Internet


1166
00:38:43,526 --> 00:38:44,976
protocol versions for cellular


1167
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:45,666
connections.


1168
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:51,186
Like iOS we also added a lot of


1169
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:52,906
new features to macOS to improve


1170
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:54,156
the setup experience.


1171
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:56,646
The new system migration payload


1172
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:58,506
can be used to configure custom


1173
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,346
migration paths for migration


1174
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:01,976
from Windows to Mac.


1175
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:05,056
We also added a new payload to


1176
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:06,726
configure smart card options on


1177
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:06,866
Mac.


1178
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,296
This payload can be used to


1179
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,886
restrict one smart card per


1180
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:12,666
user, required trusted


1181
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:14,906
connections for smart card and


1182
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:16,976
also disable smart card usage on


1183
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:17,786
Mac.


1184
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:21,196
We improved the 802.1X payload


1185
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:23,306
adding the ability to provide a


1186
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:25,566
default configuration for ports


1187
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,206
that doesn't have an explicit


1188
00:39:27,236 --> 00:39:27,996
configuration.


1189
00:39:29,956 --> 00:39:32,206
Starting with macOS High Sierra


1190
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:33,946
administrators now have the


1191
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:35,616
ability to delay the software


1192
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:37,586
updates on a Mac for up to a


1193
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,086
maximum of 90 days.


1194
00:39:41,096 --> 00:39:43,046
This is great for testing your


1195
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:44,836
software on the latest updates


1196
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,776
before users get their hands on


1197
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:46,996
them.


1198
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,566
We also updated the software


1199
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,786
update query to include a date


1200
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:53,296
until which a specific update


1201
00:39:53,296 --> 00:39:54,056
will be deferred.


1202
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:59,216
Former passwords on macOS are


1203
00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:01,566
equivalent to activation lock on


1204
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:01,976
iOS.


1205
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,666
Starting with macOS High Sierra


1206
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,356
the former passwords can be


1207
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:08,226
completely managed using an MDM


1208
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:08,636
server.


1209
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:11,426
Using the new commands the


1210
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,036
administrator can set a former


1211
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,166
password, query the status of


1212
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:17,036
the password change, and also


1213
00:40:17,036 --> 00:40:18,346
verify that the password on the


1214
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:19,836
device is correct once the


1215
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:21,406
password change is in effect.


1216
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:22,286
Thank you.


1217
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:26,036
I would like to note that a


1218
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,456
reboot is required for the


1219
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:28,936
password change to take effect.


1220
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,776
We also brought over the user


1221
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:33,896
management commands from iOS to


1222
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:34,666
macOS.


1223
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:37,286
macOS now supports querying the


1224
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:38,816
list of local user accounts on


1225
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:40,526
the Mac and deleting user


1226
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:41,046
accounts.


1227
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,786
macOS also supports unlocking a


1228
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:44,976
locked-up user account on Mac.


1229
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:51,586
Extensions are a great way to


1230
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:53,276
add a lot of useful features on


1231
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:54,996
Mac, but we also realize that


1232
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,426
there is a need to manage this


1233
00:40:56,426 --> 00:40:58,106
in an enterprise environment.


1234
00:40:59,276 --> 00:41:00,396
So, the new extensions


1235
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:02,126
management payload can be used


1236
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,056
to configure whitelist and


1237
00:41:04,056 --> 00:41:05,606
blacklist of extensions that are


1238
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:06,876
allowed to run on a Mac.


1239
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:08,806
The payload also has the


1240
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:10,136
flexibility to configure


1241
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,346
blacklist and whitelist on a per


1242
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,796
extension bind basis.


1243
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:15,686
It can go even further and


1244
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:17,216
disable specific extension


1245
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:19,436
points or disable all extensions


1246
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:20,716
on Mac if you have to do so.


1247
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:23,546
Once the extensions are set up


1248
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:26,076
as they need to be the new


1249
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:27,916
active extensions query can be


1250
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,166
used to query the list of


1251
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,336
extensions that are in use on a


1252
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:32,396
per user basis.


1253
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:36,976
macOS already supports escrowing


1254
00:41:36,976 --> 00:41:38,756
encrypted personal recovery keys


1255
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:40,946
to a custom server and starting


1256
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:42,376
with macOS High Sierra we


1257
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:43,766
followed that into MDM.


1258
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:46,176
The new escrow payload can be


1259
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:47,826
used to configure the private


1260
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:49,336
key using which personal


1261
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:50,836
recovery should be encrypted.


1262
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:53,596
And we also updated the security


1263
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:55,676
information query to retrieve


1264
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:58,186
the personal recovery key using


1265
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:00,016
an MDM server.


1266
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:01,706
We also added a new restriction


1267
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:03,916
to disable iCloud desktop and


1268
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:04,496
documents.


1269
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:10,046
We aggressively added a lot of


1270
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:12,396
features to tvOS this last year.


1271
00:42:13,086 --> 00:42:14,586
We set ourselves a goal to


1272
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:15,716
provide a great set of


1273
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,946
expedience for Apple TVs without


1274
00:42:17,946 --> 00:42:19,146
ever touching your remote.


1275
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:22,986
It is now possible to erase an


1276
00:42:22,986 --> 00:42:24,296
Apple TV using Apple


1277
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:26,796
Configurator or MDM and enroll


1278
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:30,156
the Apple TV using DEP and Auto


1279
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,776
Advance like Bob talked about


1280
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:35,066
earlier, specify the name of the


1281
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:37,906
Apple TV, prevent the users from


1282
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:39,446
changing the name on the TV,


1283
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:42,566
configure allowed content


1284
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:44,486
restrictions, such as media


1285
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:47,716
ratings, specify the list of


1286
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:48,956
apps that are available on the


1287
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:51,576
TV, and also configure how the


1288
00:42:51,576 --> 00:42:52,926
apps are laid out on the Home


1289
00:42:52,926 --> 00:42:54,746
screen including folders.


1290
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:56,036
Isn't that great?


1291
00:42:58,736 --> 00:42:59,006
Thank you.


1292
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:03,436
Apple TVs are great for


1293
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:05,166
conference rooms and classrooms.


1294
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:07,346
So, we built a new management


1295
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:09,216
feature to put Apple TV into a


1296
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:11,166
mode that we call Conference


1297
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:11,996
Room Display mode.


1298
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:14,356
When in this mode Apple TV can


1299
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:15,646
be configured to display a


1300
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:17,736
custom message onscreen and the


1301
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:19,836
only thing the users can do is


1302
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:21,466
to [inaudible] the TV to share


1303
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:22,336
their displays.


1304
00:43:22,856 --> 00:43:25,266
We also added a new AirPlay


1305
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,006
Security payload using which


1306
00:43:27,006 --> 00:43:28,566
administrators can configure the


1307
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,156
type of the security requirement


1308
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:30,796
for AirPlay.


1309
00:43:31,586 --> 00:43:32,566
This can be one of three


1310
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,936
options, one-time possible, a


1311
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:37,026
passcode every time or even a


1312
00:43:37,026 --> 00:43:38,726
custom password which can be


1313
00:43:38,726 --> 00:43:40,126
configured using the payload.


1314
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:42,936
We believe this combined with


1315
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:45,536
AirPlay payload on iOS and macOS


1316
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:47,086
gives the administrators the


1317
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:49,756
ability to configure AirPlay


1318
00:43:49,756 --> 00:43:50,896
with the greatest security


1319
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:53,206
possible and ease-of-use.


1320
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:56,816
Apple TVs are also great for


1321
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:59,586
kiosks and dashboards, so we


1322
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:01,026
brought over the single app mode


1323
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:03,356
from iOS to tvOS and as you


1324
00:44:03,356 --> 00:44:05,356
would expect, this payload can


1325
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,326
be used to log a TV to a single


1326
00:44:07,326 --> 00:44:07,556
app.


1327
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,526
To go along with this, we also


1328
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:12,026
added two new restrictions, one


1329
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:14,496
to disable users from pairing


1330
00:44:14,496 --> 00:44:15,906
the remote app on their iOS


1331
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:18,286
devices with a TV and the next


1332
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:22,426
one to disable AirPlay on a TV.


1333
00:44:22,586 --> 00:44:24,046
Next, let's talk about some of


1334
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:25,026
the features that are shared


1335
00:44:25,026 --> 00:44:26,526
across all the platforms.


1336
00:44:28,486 --> 00:44:32,476
VPN IKEv2 and Wi-Fi payloads now


1337
00:44:32,476 --> 00:44:34,136
support configuring minimum and


1338
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:35,766
maximum TLS versions.


1339
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:38,486
The install application list is


1340
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:39,756
now consistent on all three


1341
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:42,276
platforms and accurately reports


1342
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:43,246
whether an app is being


1343
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:44,496
installed or updated.


1344
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:50,706
We now support Restart on iOS,


1345
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:53,686
tvOS and macOS and Shut down on


1346
00:44:53,736 --> 00:44:57,146
iOS and macOS.


1347
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,866
We already have a great support


1348
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,126
for test taking apps with


1349
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:01,226
automatic assessment


1350
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:02,046
configuration.


1351
00:45:03,376 --> 00:45:04,426
I'm happy to announce the


1352
00:45:04,426 --> 00:45:05,466
automatic assessment


1353
00:45:05,466 --> 00:45:07,146
configuration now includes five


1354
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:09,306
new restrictions without you


1355
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,846
having to make any changes.


1356
00:45:11,296 --> 00:45:13,416
Activity continuation, universal


1357
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:16,656
clipboard, dictation and in the


1358
00:45:16,656 --> 00:45:18,006
upcoming release smart


1359
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,436
punctuation, and classrooms


1360
00:45:19,436 --> 00:45:20,316
screen observation.


1361
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:24,176
These are the set of


1362
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:26,436
restrictions that existed even


1363
00:45:26,436 --> 00:45:27,996
before supervision was a thing.


1364
00:45:28,296 --> 00:45:31,176
And Todd has been warning you


1365
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:32,986
for the past two years that


1366
00:45:32,986 --> 00:45:33,826
these are going to become


1367
00:45:33,826 --> 00:45:35,536
supervised only and I get to


1368
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:36,976
tell you when.


1369
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,096
Starting 2018 these restrictions


1370
00:45:40,096 --> 00:45:41,426
will become supervised only.


1371
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:43,816
With that, please welcome my


1372
00:45:43,816 --> 00:45:45,706
colleagues, Graham and John on


1373
00:45:45,706 --> 00:45:47,306
stage to demo some of the


1374
00:45:47,306 --> 00:45:48,346
features that I've been talking


1375
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:48,576
about.


1376
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:48,976
Thank you.


1377
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:52,586
[ Applause ]


1378
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,166
>> Thank you very much Pradhap.


1379
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,176
I'm really excited to be here


1380
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:56,226
today to show you guys the


1381
00:45:56,226 --> 00:45:57,566
latest management features for


1382
00:45:57,566 --> 00:45:58,306
Apple TV.


1383
00:45:58,976 --> 00:46:01,576
In tvOS 10.2, we added a ton of


1384
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:02,856
great new features for managing


1385
00:46:02,856 --> 00:46:05,776
Apple TVs and today with tvOS 11


1386
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:07,176
we're expanding on that feature


1387
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:07,586
set.


1388
00:46:08,036 --> 00:46:09,256
While our Apple TV is currently


1389
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:11,216
booting so let's set the scene.


1390
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:12,736
It's summer vacation and you've


1391
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,776
just received your order of


1392
00:46:13,776 --> 00:46:15,356
Apple TVs and it's time to get


1393
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,626
them configured for the upcoming


1394
00:46:16,626 --> 00:46:17,266
school year.


1395
00:46:18,106 --> 00:46:19,486
I've already set up a default


1396
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,276
MDM server in Apple School


1397
00:46:21,276 --> 00:46:22,816
Manager so my devices have


1398
00:46:22,816 --> 00:46:24,306
already appeared in my MDM


1399
00:46:24,306 --> 00:46:24,726
server.


1400
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:26,816
I've also gone ahead and


1401
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:27,686
configured the enrollment


1402
00:46:27,686 --> 00:46:28,676
options that I'll want for


1403
00:46:28,676 --> 00:46:30,576
today's demo, including the auto


1404
00:46:30,576 --> 00:46:32,506
advance key and nonremovable


1405
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:33,066
MDM.


1406
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:35,126
I've also added the device to a


1407
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,506
group that contains some of the


1408
00:46:36,506 --> 00:46:37,486
settings that we're going to use


1409
00:46:37,486 --> 00:46:38,126
today as well.


1410
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:39,546
Those include a Home screen


1411
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,186
layout payload, we've hidden


1412
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:42,156
some of the default system


1413
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:44,286
applications and installed some


1414
00:46:44,286 --> 00:46:45,106
enterprise apps.


1415
00:46:45,566 --> 00:46:46,846
So, it looks like we're still


1416
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,456
booting up here so let's talk


1417
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:49,926
about what's going on behind the


1418
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:50,456
scenes.


1419
00:46:51,216 --> 00:46:52,266
Once the device reaches the


1420
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:53,766
setup screen it will begin its


1421
00:46:53,766 --> 00:46:55,056
activation process if it's


1422
00:46:55,056 --> 00:46:55,986
connected to ethernet.


1423
00:46:56,976 --> 00:46:58,226
The device will check in with


1424
00:46:58,226 --> 00:46:59,456
the activation server and if


1425
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:00,396
it's enrolled in the Device


1426
00:47:00,396 --> 00:47:01,796
Enrollment Program it will


1427
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:03,256
download the cloud configuration


1428
00:47:03,256 --> 00:47:05,146
file and look for that auto


1429
00:47:05,146 --> 00:47:05,846
advance key.


1430
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,996
If the auto advance key is found


1431
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:09,536
the device will begin its setup


1432
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,986
process and enroll in MDM.


1433
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:13,856
So, it looks like we've just got


1434
00:47:13,856 --> 00:47:14,976
another couple of seconds here


1435
00:47:14,976 --> 00:47:16,236
before this reaches the screen.


1436
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:17,406
So, I hope everyone's having a


1437
00:47:17,406 --> 00:47:18,766
fantastic conference so far,


1438
00:47:19,266 --> 00:47:19,916
woohoo.


1439
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:22,626
So, we can see that our Home


1440
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:23,536
screen layout payload has been


1441
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:25,296
applied so we've got some of our


1442
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:26,136
default apps they're in a


1443
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:27,696
folder, most of the default


1444
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:28,886
system applications have been


1445
00:47:28,886 --> 00:47:31,076
hidden, and we've got some


1446
00:47:31,076 --> 00:47:31,956
enterprise apps that have been


1447
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:32,366
installed.


1448
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,106
So, now that we're ready to go


1449
00:47:34,426 --> 00:47:35,746
let's take a look at the new


1450
00:47:35,746 --> 00:47:37,046
single app mode payload.


1451
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:38,726
We'll go ahead and launch one of


1452
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:39,656
our enterprise apps in the


1453
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:40,496
single app mode.


1454
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:42,146
For today's demo, we've got a


1455
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:43,576
foreign currency exchange app


1456
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:44,796
that shows us the exchange rate


1457
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:46,766
for the US dollar in various


1458
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:47,926
currencies around the world.


1459
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:49,706
It looks like the Canadian


1460
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:50,936
dollar is doing pretty great


1461
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:52,046
today.


1462
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:53,616
Yeah, Canada.


1463
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:56,126
All right, but now let's say


1464
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,776
that we're managing Apple TVs in


1465
00:47:57,776 --> 00:47:58,736
different countries around the


1466
00:47:58,736 --> 00:48:00,266
world, they'll likely want to


1467
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:01,266
see that exchange rate in their


1468
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:02,096
local currency.


1469
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:03,916
So, let's go ahead and install a


1470
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:05,626
managed app configuration and


1471
00:48:05,626 --> 00:48:06,376
see what happens.


1472
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:08,866
Now you'll notice that we're in


1473
00:48:08,866 --> 00:48:09,986
Canadian dollars for our base


1474
00:48:09,986 --> 00:48:10,976
currency, pretty cool hey?


1475
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:15,586
[ Applause ]


1476
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:17,456
All right, next let's take a


1477
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:18,416
look at the conference room


1478
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:19,476
display mode payload.


1479
00:48:20,046 --> 00:48:21,316
So, perhaps this Apple TV is


1480
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,626
being used in a conference room


1481
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:24,526
where we're doing presentations


1482
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,466
on a regular basis.


1483
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,096
We can now remotely place the


1484
00:48:27,096 --> 00:48:28,206
Apple TV in conference room


1485
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:29,646
display mode and as you can see,


1486
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:30,866
we can add a custom message for


1487
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,316
our users.


1488
00:48:31,586 --> 00:48:34,126
Hello WWDC 2017, wooo.


1489
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,376
You'll notice that the


1490
00:48:38,376 --> 00:48:39,896
conference room display mode has


1491
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:41,486
integrated seamlessly with


1492
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,736
single app mode payload, meaning


1493
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:45,006
that we can [inaudible] a room


1494
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,466
at any given time with either


1495
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:46,956
payload.


1496
00:48:47,906 --> 00:48:49,506
Finally, let's take a look at


1497
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:50,886
the AirPlay security payload


1498
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,446
that we added in tvOS 11.


1499
00:48:53,206 --> 00:48:54,886
We've got an iPad here running


1500
00:48:55,136 --> 00:48:56,936
iOS, so we're going to go ahead


1501
00:48:56,936 --> 00:48:58,336
and start an AirPlay session


1502
00:48:58,446 --> 00:48:59,376
with this Apple TV.


1503
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:01,026
You'll notice that we are


1504
00:49:01,026 --> 00:49:02,206
prompted for the password that


1505
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:03,636
we defined in the AirPlay


1506
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:04,686
security payload.


1507
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,376
While this is fantastic from a


1508
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,386
security perspective it's not as


1509
00:49:08,386 --> 00:49:09,916
easy as we'd like for our users.


1510
00:49:10,716 --> 00:49:12,576
So now we've got a second iPad


1511
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:13,566
here that's got the AirPlay


1512
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:15,516
security or the AirPlay payload


1513
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,256
installed on it so let's see how


1514
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:18,506
much easier we can make this for


1515
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:19,046
our users.


1516
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:21,166
So, now when we start our


1517
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,856
AirPlay session you'll notice


1518
00:49:22,856 --> 00:49:24,396
that this is the only Apple TV


1519
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:26,196
that we can AirPlay to and we


1520
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,056
weren't prompted for the


1521
00:49:27,056 --> 00:49:27,606
password.


1522
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:29,196
This makes for a seamless


1523
00:49:29,196 --> 00:49:30,556
experience for our users, it is


1524
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:31,976
also very secure for our


1525
00:49:31,976 --> 00:49:32,706
institution.


1526
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:34,426
And with that, I'd like to thank


1527
00:49:34,426 --> 00:49:35,396
you very much for your time


1528
00:49:35,396 --> 00:49:36,676
today and I'll turn the stage


1529
00:49:36,676 --> 00:49:37,486
back over to Todd.


1530
00:49:37,786 --> 00:49:41,346
>> Thanks Todd.


1531
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:45,036
Thank you very much Graham and


1532
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:45,326
Todd.


1533
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:50,536
So, one reason we're so excited


1534
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:52,366
about all these new features is


1535
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:53,866
what some of you have already


1536
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,286
done with them and we want to


1537
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:56,646
just make it even easier for you


1538
00:49:56,646 --> 00:49:58,746
to do those things better and we


1539
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,156
can't wait to see what you can


1540
00:50:00,156 --> 00:50:00,906
come up with next.


1541
00:50:01,236 --> 00:50:02,696
I want to highlight one example


1542
00:50:02,696 --> 00:50:04,576
that UC San Diego did at their


1543
00:50:04,576 --> 00:50:06,436
new Jacobs Medical Center where


1544
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,176
they provide each patient when


1545
00:50:08,176 --> 00:50:09,356
they enter the hospital with an


1546
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:11,986
iPad in their hospital room that


1547
00:50:11,986 --> 00:50:12,966
they can use to monitor their


1548
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:14,876
care, as well as manage the


1549
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:16,036
entertainment options in the


1550
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:17,956
room on Apple TV.


1551
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:20,816
Now with that last feature that


1552
00:50:20,816 --> 00:50:22,716
Graham just showed they can


1553
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:24,646
securely connect pairs of


1554
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:26,946
patient iPad and Apple TV so the


1555
00:50:26,946 --> 00:50:28,256
patient can't inadvertently


1556
00:50:28,256 --> 00:50:29,366
interfere with the patient in


1557
00:50:29,366 --> 00:50:30,066
the next room.


1558
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:32,066
We're so excited about


1559
00:50:32,066 --> 00:50:33,416
deployments like these that can


1560
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,066
really improve people's lives by


1561
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,456
giving them more control over


1562
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:37,716
their experience in a hospital


1563
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:39,106
and we can't wait to see what


1564
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:40,076
else you can do with them.


1565
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:42,046
So that concludes our management


1566
00:50:42,046 --> 00:50:42,506
section.


1567
00:50:43,216 --> 00:50:44,686
So, let's turn to a quick update


1568
00:50:44,686 --> 00:50:45,986
on Apple's device management


1569
00:50:45,986 --> 00:50:46,386
tools.


1570
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,916
Of course, Apple Configurator


1571
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,336
and Profile Manager which we've


1572
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:53,086
updated this in seeds this week


1573
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:54,796
support all these new features.


1574
00:50:55,406 --> 00:50:56,556
And I'm going to talk a bit in


1575
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:57,416
more detail about those


1576
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:58,956
classroom and content caching in


1577
00:50:58,956 --> 00:50:59,386
a moment.


1578
00:51:00,006 --> 00:51:01,336
But I also wanted to mention


1579
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:02,486
that we have created a new


1580
00:51:02,486 --> 00:51:04,386
roster simulator as a complement


1581
00:51:04,386 --> 00:51:06,446
to our existing DEP and VPP


1582
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:08,786
simulators that help MDM vendors


1583
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:10,686
test their implementation of our


1584
00:51:10,686 --> 00:51:12,866
APIs for our deployment


1585
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:13,396
services.


1586
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,066
The roster simulator will allow


1587
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:16,436
you to do that for Apple School


1588
00:51:16,436 --> 00:51:18,226
Manager's APIs for obtaining


1589
00:51:18,726 --> 00:51:20,846
accounts and class information.


1590
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:22,886
So, we will be posting those


1591
00:51:22,886 --> 00:51:25,026
very soon, we encourage you to


1592
00:51:25,076 --> 00:51:26,466
download the roster simulator


1593
00:51:26,466 --> 00:51:27,806
and the updated versions of the


1594
00:51:27,806 --> 00:51:29,946
DEP and VPP simulators to make


1595
00:51:29,946 --> 00:51:31,296
sure that your MDM solutions


1596
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:32,696
integrate really well with our


1597
00:51:32,696 --> 00:51:33,716
deployment services.


1598
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,356
So, this spring we shipped


1599
00:51:36,356 --> 00:51:39,176
Classroom 2 which had a really


1600
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:40,766
critical new feature to make the


1601
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:42,326
audience much wider and allowing


1602
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:43,396
teachers to create their own


1603
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:44,106
classes.


1604
00:51:44,796 --> 00:51:46,126
We also now allow teachers and


1605
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:47,556
students to share documents and


1606
00:51:47,556 --> 00:51:48,456
URLs with each other.


1607
00:51:49,326 --> 00:51:51,336
And of particular importance


1608
00:51:51,336 --> 00:51:52,546
when the teacher needs a bit of


1609
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:54,996
peace and quiet feature can now


1610
00:51:54,996 --> 00:51:56,176
mute the student devices.


1611
00:51:57,456 --> 00:51:59,396
Earlier this week we released or


1612
00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:02,286
we seeded Classroom 2.1 which as


1613
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,546
Pradhap mentioned already, we've


1614
00:52:03,546 --> 00:52:04,866
introduced a handful of new


1615
00:52:04,866 --> 00:52:06,216
restrictions for supervised


1616
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:08,526
devices that allow schools which


1617
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,226
want to use teacher created


1618
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:11,726
classes on their supervised


1619
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:13,756
student iPads to achieve most of


1620
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,446
the behavior of managed classes.


1621
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,046
And we've also added a new


1622
00:52:18,046 --> 00:52:19,386
student activity view that


1623
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,766
appears at the end of each class


1624
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:22,816
session and it looks like this.


1625
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:24,776
So, the teacher can get a quick


1626
00:52:24,956 --> 00:52:26,176
overview of which apps her


1627
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,866
students used and most often.


1628
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,276
Can easily see which app each


1629
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:32,246
student used and when.


1630
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:35,676
Can look at any documents or


1631
00:52:35,676 --> 00:52:37,236
URLs the students shared during


1632
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:38,066
the class session.


1633
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:41,146
And also drill into each student


1634
00:52:41,146 --> 00:52:42,406
to see which apps that student


1635
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:43,096
used and when.


1636
00:52:43,896 --> 00:52:47,086
So that's Classroom 2.1, try it


1637
00:52:47,086 --> 00:52:47,296
out.


1638
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:49,246
Next, content caching.


1639
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,136
Now the caching server has been


1640
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:53,166
an important feature for schools


1641
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:54,816
and businesses to optimize their


1642
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:57,026
download bandwidth usage and


1643
00:52:57,026 --> 00:52:58,246
it's been part of macOS server


1644
00:52:58,246 --> 00:52:59,906
for years so why do I have a new


1645
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:00,626
badge up there?


1646
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:02,366
Well that's because it's now


1647
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:03,766
built right into macOS High


1648
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:05,706
Sierra making it much easier for


1649
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:07,556
it to be used even more commonly


1650
00:53:07,556 --> 00:53:08,606
in schools and businesses.


1651
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:12,536
We also now have UI for the


1652
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:13,836
caching server and the new


1653
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:15,226
tether caching service that we


1654
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:16,786
soft launched earlier this


1655
00:53:16,786 --> 00:53:19,456
spring in macOS 10.12.4 so that


1656
00:53:19,456 --> 00:53:20,766
it would be available in time


1657
00:53:20,766 --> 00:53:21,836
for summer's preparations for


1658
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:22,606
the next school year.


1659
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,336
But instead of talking about it


1660
00:53:24,336 --> 00:53:25,626
more I would love to have Nolan


1661
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:26,786
Astron [phonetic] to come up and


1662
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:27,706
demo it to you.


1663
00:53:27,826 --> 00:53:27,976
Nolan.


1664
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:33,026
[ Applause ]


1665
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:36,106
>> I'm Nolan Astron, I'm a


1666
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:38,806
software engineer at Apple and


1667
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:41,276
today I'm going to demo for you


1668
00:53:41,536 --> 00:53:42,286
tethered caching.


1669
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,076
Tethered caching has three main


1670
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:46,596
pieces to it.


1671
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:48,116
It provides a wired Internet


1672
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:49,336
connection to all the USB


1673
00:53:49,336 --> 00:53:51,246
connected iOS devices, it


1674
00:53:51,246 --> 00:53:52,976
instantiates the content caching


1675
00:53:52,976 --> 00:53:54,476
service on the Mac, and it


1676
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:56,266
funnels all the network traffic


1677
00:53:56,546 --> 00:53:57,736
of those tethered devices


1678
00:53:57,926 --> 00:53:59,236
through the content caching


1679
00:53:59,276 --> 00:54:00,466
service when downloading


1680
00:54:00,466 --> 00:54:01,716
cachable Apple content.


1681
00:54:03,036 --> 00:54:04,356
To enable this feature, you're


1682
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:06,156
going to want to pop into the


1683
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:07,706
sharing pane of System


1684
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:08,966
Preferences and you're going to


1685
00:54:08,966 --> 00:54:10,556
want to have the Share Internet


1686
00:54:10,556 --> 00:54:12,806
Connection checkbox checked and


1687
00:54:12,806 --> 00:54:14,666
the Content Caching checkbox


1688
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:15,976
checked just like I do here.


1689
00:54:16,516 --> 00:54:20,606
[ Applause ]


1690
00:54:21,106 --> 00:54:22,066
Those iOS devices they can be


1691
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:25,016
plugged in at any time, but this


1692
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:26,476
feature really shines when those


1693
00:54:26,646 --> 00:54:28,826
iOS devices are enrolled in MDM.


1694
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:30,916
When an MDM enrolled iOS device


1695
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:32,366
becomes tethered it


1696
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:33,946
automatically checks in with its


1697
00:54:33,946 --> 00:54:35,826
MDM server and sees if it has


1698
00:54:35,826 --> 00:54:37,036
any commands to process.


1699
00:54:37,226 --> 00:54:39,876
If a particular command requires


1700
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,666
the network it's going to use


1701
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,296
its USB interface instead of its


1702
00:54:43,296 --> 00:54:45,996
Wi-Fi interface when leveraging


1703
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:48,486
the network.


1704
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:50,916
This feature is extremely useful


1705
00:54:51,066 --> 00:54:52,536
when provisioning a large number


1706
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:54,686
of iOS devices with overlapping


1707
00:54:54,686 --> 00:54:56,056
cachable Apple content.


1708
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:59,286
All right, so in front of me I


1709
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:01,526
have four iPads hooked up to a


1710
00:55:01,526 --> 00:55:02,776
tethered caching station.


1711
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:04,546
Eventually I'm going to download


1712
00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:06,536
the same app to each one of the


1713
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:07,156
devices.


1714
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:09,836
But while I do the download I'm


1715
00:55:10,036 --> 00:55:11,096
going to show you a little tool


1716
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:12,206
that I built that's going to


1717
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:14,546
monitor the network activity of


1718
00:55:14,546 --> 00:55:16,236
the Mac's Wi-Fi interface and of


1719
00:55:16,236 --> 00:55:18,106
the Mac's USB network


1720
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:18,746
interfaces.


1721
00:55:18,746 --> 00:55:20,276
On the left-hand side, you'll


1722
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:22,246
see a meter for Wi-Fi and on the


1723
00:55:22,246 --> 00:55:24,006
right-hand side, you will see a


1724
00:55:24,006 --> 00:55:25,566
meter for USB network activity.


1725
00:55:26,276 --> 00:55:27,626
So right now, I'm going to


1726
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:29,656
download the app to the first


1727
00:55:29,656 --> 00:55:29,976
device.


1728
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,756
You'll see that both the Wi-Fi


1729
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:40,766
and USB network activity are


1730
00:55:40,766 --> 00:55:42,916
required to process that


1731
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:43,686
download command.


1732
00:55:43,686 --> 00:55:45,346
The Mac needs to download the


1733
00:55:45,346 --> 00:55:46,666
asset from the Internet and it


1734
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:48,116
needs to push it to the device


1735
00:55:48,436 --> 00:55:49,116
over USB.


1736
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:51,036
All right, cool.


1737
00:55:51,036 --> 00:55:52,826
Well now that the app is cached


1738
00:55:52,826 --> 00:55:54,296
I'm going to download the same


1739
00:55:54,296 --> 00:55:55,536
app to the remaining three


1740
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:55,976
devices.


1741
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:05,766
Awesome. You'll see that for all


1742
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:06,966
the remaining downloads of that


1743
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:08,846
same app there's no network


1744
00:56:08,846 --> 00:56:10,496
activity on the Wi-Fi interface


1745
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:10,946
required.


1746
00:56:10,946 --> 00:56:12,266
The Mac already has a cached


1747
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:14,006
copy of it and all it needs to


1748
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:15,806
do is push that cached version


1749
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:17,506
to the devices over USB.


1750
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:20,436
And just to be clear, it's not


1751
00:56:20,436 --> 00:56:22,476
required that one iPad download


1752
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:23,866
the app before any other ones


1753
00:56:23,866 --> 00:56:25,986
that was done strictly for demo


1754
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:26,616
purposes.


1755
00:56:27,096 --> 00:56:28,266
So why are you going to like


1756
00:56:28,266 --> 00:56:28,806
this feature?


1757
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:30,296
Well we think you're going to


1758
00:56:30,296 --> 00:56:31,446
like the tethered part of


1759
00:56:31,446 --> 00:56:32,756
tethered caching because it's


1760
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,346
going to move the network


1761
00:56:34,346 --> 00:56:35,566
bandwidth required for


1762
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:36,876
provisioning a large number of


1763
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:38,746
devices off your Wi-Fi network


1764
00:56:39,186 --> 00:56:40,686
leaving it usable for the rest


1765
00:56:40,686 --> 00:56:41,596
of the connected clients.


1766
00:56:41,946 --> 00:56:42,826
And we think you're going to


1767
00:56:42,826 --> 00:56:43,896
like the caching part of


1768
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:45,166
tethered caching as it will


1769
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,656
significantly reduce the amount


1770
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:47,896
of bandwidth necessary to


1771
00:56:48,016 --> 00:56:49,856
provision your iOS devices.


1772
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:51,436
Thank you for watching and I'm


1773
00:56:51,436 --> 00:56:52,766
going to hand the stage back to


1774
00:56:52,766 --> 00:56:52,976
Todd.


1775
00:56:53,516 --> 00:56:59,546
[ Applause ]


1776
00:57:00,046 --> 00:57:00,936
>> Thank you very much Nolan.


1777
00:57:00,936 --> 00:57:02,546
I do want to apologize that we


1778
00:57:02,546 --> 00:57:04,266
forgot to install the Siri


1779
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:05,726
profanity filter restriction on


1780
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:08,006
this session, but we'll take


1781
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:10,626
care of that.


1782
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,836
So that brings us to the end of


1783
00:57:12,836 --> 00:57:14,566
our tools update and I just want


1784
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:17,176
to quickly sum up as we wrap up


1785
00:57:17,176 --> 00:57:18,676
our time together with a couple


1786
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:20,066
of notes for app developers.


1787
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:22,336
Now that we support managed app


1788
00:57:22,336 --> 00:57:24,426
configuration for tvOS apps too,


1789
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:26,566
please make sure your apps are


1790
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:27,306
supported.


1791
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:29,516
For those of you who would like


1792
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:30,956
to sell a lot of copies of your


1793
00:57:30,956 --> 00:57:33,686
apps into education, make sure


1794
00:57:33,686 --> 00:57:34,856
that they're good customers for


1795
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:37,386
Shared iPad by storing all the


1796
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:39,446
data that you want to persist in


1797
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:40,996
the cloud, whether it's iCloud


1798
00:57:40,996 --> 00:57:42,716
or your own third-party cloud


1799
00:57:42,716 --> 00:57:44,456
solution and don't rely on


1800
00:57:44,456 --> 00:57:46,056
backup or local data which won't


1801
00:57:46,136 --> 00:57:47,756
survive logging into a different


1802
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:48,296
device.


1803
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:50,166
Once you've done this work you


1804
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,586
can also take advantage of the


1805
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:53,496
option in iTunes Connect to mark


1806
00:57:53,496 --> 00:57:55,086
your app as optimized for Shared


1807
00:57:55,086 --> 00:57:56,676
iPad again, making it more


1808
00:57:56,896 --> 00:57:58,616
interesting to education


1809
00:57:58,616 --> 00:58:00,036
customers who might want to buy


1810
00:58:00,096 --> 00:58:01,316
hundreds or thousands of copies


1811
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:02,146
of it.


1812
00:58:02,966 --> 00:58:05,436
Finally, if your app has a


1813
00:58:05,436 --> 00:58:06,876
strong dependency on network


1814
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:09,886
traffic and latency, take


1815
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,286
advantage of some of the Cisco


1816
00:58:11,286 --> 00:58:12,776
Fastlane options to optimize


1817
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:15,206
that traffic and there's a lab


1818
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:16,846
tomorrow that I will highlight


1819
00:58:16,846 --> 00:58:17,826
in a moment where you can get


1820
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:18,396
help with that.


1821
00:58:19,946 --> 00:58:21,726
For MDM vendors, of course we


1822
00:58:21,726 --> 00:58:22,656
want you to support all these


1823
00:58:22,656 --> 00:58:24,256
new features and we'll be in the


1824
00:58:24,256 --> 00:58:26,016
lab after this to help you with


1825
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:26,656
any questions you have.


1826
00:58:26,656 --> 00:58:28,266
I would also like to encourage


1827
00:58:28,266 --> 00:58:29,626
you to adopt all the security


1828
00:58:29,626 --> 00:58:30,726
enhancements that Bob talked


1829
00:58:30,726 --> 00:58:31,816
about during the enrollment


1830
00:58:31,816 --> 00:58:32,316
section.


1831
00:58:33,996 --> 00:58:35,256
For administrators, take


1832
00:58:35,256 --> 00:58:36,476
advantage of all these great new


1833
00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:38,086
capabilities to build compelling


1834
00:58:38,086 --> 00:58:40,486
new deployments that link iPads


1835
00:58:40,486 --> 00:58:42,976
and Macs and Apple TV just like


1836
00:58:42,976 --> 00:58:44,926
UCSD has and come up with some


1837
00:58:44,926 --> 00:58:46,256
amazing things that no one else


1838
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:46,816
has thought of.


1839
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:51,356
And finally, be ready, yes


1840
00:58:51,356 --> 00:58:52,616
Pradhap stole my thunder, but


1841
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:54,296
next you need to be ready for


1842
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:55,426
those restrictions to be


1843
00:58:55,426 --> 00:58:57,296
supervised only and honored only


1844
00:58:57,296 --> 00:58:58,596
on supervised devices.


1845
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:02,246
So, we had a lot more


1846
00:59:02,246 --> 00:59:04,036
information, documentation, help


1847
00:59:04,066 --> 00:59:06,716
guides for the tools, all kinds


1848
00:59:06,716 --> 00:59:07,866
of information at the session


1849
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:09,536
link, session 304.


1850
00:59:11,456 --> 00:59:12,496
We have a couple of sessions


1851
00:59:12,496 --> 00:59:13,976
still happening this week that


1852
00:59:13,976 --> 00:59:14,996
you might be interested in.


1853
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:18,036
There's a What's New with Screen


1854
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:20,156
Recording tomorrow morning that


1855
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,846
if you're building tools for


1856
00:59:21,846 --> 00:59:24,256
remotely assisting customers


1857
00:59:24,256 --> 00:59:25,056
that there's some very


1858
00:59:25,056 --> 00:59:26,326
interesting technology in the


1859
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:27,576
new version of ReplayKit.


1860
00:59:28,446 --> 00:59:29,776
And we talked a little bit about


1861
00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:31,186
kiosk and assessment apps, but


1862
00:59:31,186 --> 00:59:32,246
there's a whole session about


1863
00:59:32,246 --> 00:59:33,336
that tomorrow afternoon if


1864
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,246
you're interested in that, I


1865
00:59:34,516 --> 00:59:35,666
encourage you to check that out.


1866
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:37,426
And with that, I will thank you


1867
00:59:37,426 --> 00:59:38,866
very much for your attention and


1868
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,926
hope you enjoy the rest of the


1869
00:59:39,926 --> 00:59:40,046
WWDC.


1870
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:40,946
Thank you very much.
