00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,226
>> Hello and welcome.


4
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:25,386
I'm Lindsay Verity from


5
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:27,026
Advertising Platforms and I'll


6
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,436
be joined by my colleague, Carol


7
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:29,886
Hsu, and we're here today to


8
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:31,756
tell you what's new in Search


9
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:32,006
Ads.


10
00:00:33,306 --> 00:00:35,846
Search Ads was first introduced


11
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,916
to the App Store in the U.S. in


12
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,756
October 2016 as an efficient and


13
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,306
easy way for you to promote your


14
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:44,056
apps directly in App Store


15
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,066
search results so customers


16
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,726
could discover your apps while


17
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:49,866
protecting their privacy.


18
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,066
Search Ads Advanced has since


19
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,516
expanded to the App Stores in


20
00:00:56,516 --> 00:01:00,276
the U.K., Australia, New


21
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:01,946
Zealand, Canada, Switzerland,


22
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:02,846
and Mexico.


23
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:09,506
In December 2017, we introduced


24
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:11,016
Search Ads Basic to the App


25
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:13,116
Store in the U.S., a minimal


26
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,406
effort cost-per-install offering


27
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:17,506
that's fast become a favorite of


28
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,716
developers worldwide to promote


29
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:20,916
their apps on the U.S. App


30
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:21,356
Store.


31
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,816
And the response to Search Ads


32
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:27,026
from developers of all types has


33
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,256
been incredible.


34
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:32,916
Postsnap, a U.K.-based photocard


35
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,636
app has used Search Ads to


36
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:37,966
expand their offering to new


37
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,286
markets and they told us Search


38
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,586
Ads has given us a huge increase


39
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,336
in high-value users in multiple


40
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:45,846
regions.


41
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:48,426
Now we're using Search Ads to


42
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:52,686
help us launch other apps too.


43
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,946
And JoyTunes, creators of


44
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:56,646
instrument learning apps, are


45
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,066
seeing incredible results.


46
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,716
They say the quality of users is


47
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,716
so good that the numbers


48
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:04,736
upgrading from free to


49
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,826
subscription is double that of


50
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,626
any other pay channel.


51
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:12,406
And, for Playtika's World Series


52
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:14,216
of Poker, it's the quality and


53
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,416
engagement of users that matters


54
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:18,226
and they said Search Ads is an


55
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:20,826
extremely powerful product that


56
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,766
has brought high-quality users


57
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,416
and engagement rates 10% higher


58
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:26,896
than the average.


59
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:30,046
It's been really great and


60
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:31,606
wonderful hearing these stories


61
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:33,966
and so many more like them.


62
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,286
And so, today, I'm excited to


63
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:39,826
announce that this summer,


64
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:41,986
Search Ads Advanced is coming to


65
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:43,826
six more app stores.

67
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:47,616
Thank you.


68
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,186
Japan, South Korea, Germany,


69
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:55,016

70
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:56,776
you even more opportunities to


71
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,036
reach high-intent, high-quality


72
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:01,016
users in more of the markets


73
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,416
you've told us are most


74
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,256
important to you.


75
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:06,366
And, what's more, we'll be


76
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,566
introducing Search Ads Basic to


77
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:10,416
all 13 App Stores where Search


78
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:10,966
Ads will be available.


79
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:16,786
And we've worked hard to make


80
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,496
sure that Search Ads Basic


81
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:21,136
remains a simple, easy,


82
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:22,976
effortless way for you to


83
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:24,536
promote your apps across


84
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,916
multiple app stores.


85
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:28,536
Let me show you how easy it's


86
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:30,516
going to be.


87
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:33,426
Imagine I'm a developer and I


88
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,966
want to start to promote my new


89
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:35,646
app, NoMoss.


90
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:39,916
I simply select the app from the


91
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,506
drop-down list and note that I


92
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,516
know see an ad example on the


93
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,336
right and I'm also presented


94
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,416
with a list of the app stores


95
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,016
where Search Ads is available


96
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:53,246
and also where my NoMoss app is


97
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:53,966
available too.


98
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,956
I want to permit my app in as


99
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,776
many app stores as I can and so


100
00:03:58,776 --> 00:03:59,956
I'm going to leave all of those


101
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:00,516
selected.


102
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:05,826
Next, I enter my monthly budget,


103
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,336
which is a single budget across


104
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:09,806
all of the app stores where my


105
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:10,796
app promotion will run.


106
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,536
My monthly budget for NoMoss is


107
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:14,566
$5000.


108
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:19,315
And, finally, I input what is


109
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,055
the maximum amount I'm willing


110
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,326
to pay for an install.


111
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,676
Now, note Search Ads is


112
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:25,996
recommending a maximum


113
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:28,336
cost-per-install of $1.50, which


114
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,986
is based on what it knows about


115
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:32,246
my app and also what similar


116
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,586
apps are willing to pay for an


117
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:35,626
install, so I'm going to take


118
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:36,516
that recommendation.


119
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:41,616
I then save and I'm taken to my


120
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,336
dashboard where I'll check back


121
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:43,976
later to see the results.


122
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,906
I can now see confirmation that


123
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:51,986
my new app promotion has been


124
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:53,586
saved and it should start


125
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,736
running soon.


126
00:04:56,856 --> 00:04:59,326
From my dashboard, I can also


127
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:01,856
add another app that I want to


128
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:03,976
promote and I can also make


129
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,776
changes to any of my existing


130
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:06,596
app promotions.


131
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,236
So, I am currently running


132
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:10,636
promotions in the U.S. App Store


133
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:11,886
for my LightRight app and I'd


134
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,786
like to expand that to more app


135
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:14,176
stores.


136
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,446
To do that, I simply click on


137
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,406
the edit button at the top of


138
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:21,536
the apps card and my LightRight


139
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,946
app is only available in 10 of


140
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:25,736
the app stores where Search Ads


141
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,046
is offered, so I'm only


142
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:28,706
presented with those 10 options.


143
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,246
Now, I can pick markets


144
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:33,176
individually, Canada and France,


145
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,996
for example, or I can select


146
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:36,196
all.


147
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:42,696
I save. And I can now see that


148
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:44,976
my app is being promoted in 10


149
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:50,246
of 10 available app stores.


150
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:51,926
Now, because I'm promoting my


151
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,546
app across more app stores, I


152
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:54,956
also want to increase my monthly


153
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,926
budget to enable me to reach


154
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,166
more users and achieve more


155
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,816
installs, so I'm going to change


156
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:03,016
my monthly budget from $1000 to


157
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,176
$3500.


158
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:10,126
My change is saved and I'm done.


159
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,886
It's really that simple and we


160
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,356
can't wait for more of you to


161
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:14,826
try it.


162
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:18,156
And that was Search Ads Basic.


163
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:21,236
So, let's talk about Advanced


164
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,506
and, more specifically, new


165
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:24,536
creative options.


166
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:29,326
Developers have told us they


167
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:31,116
love the ease of Search Ads


168
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,236
Creative and how we


169
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:34,016
automatically create the ads


170
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:36,236
using the metadata and imagery


171
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:37,876
you already provide for your App


172
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:38,836
Store product page.


173
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:41,556
And App Store customers respond


174
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:43,436
really well to those ads because


175
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,206
of their noninvasive appearance


176
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,946
and because they're an accurate


177
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,246
representation of what they can


178
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:49,306
expect from the app's


179
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:49,966
experience.


180
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:54,456
Since February, you've had the


181
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,606
option to add up to 10 app


182
00:06:56,746 --> 00:07:00,756
screenshots and 3 videos on your


183
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:01,776
App Store product page.


184
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,366
And just last week, we were


185
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,526
excited to introduce our newest


186
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,706
Search Ads Advanced feature,


187
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,016
Creative Sets, giving you the


188
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,376
ability to leverage these


189
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:14,426
additional App Store assets to


190
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,626
create more ad variations to


191
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:18,456
help you better align your ad


192
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:20,476
group keyword themes with


193
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:21,976
specific audiences.


194
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:25,326
Now, let me turn it over to


195
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,756
Carol, who's going to tell you


196
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:28,586
more about how Creative Sets


197
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,216
work and give you a demo.


198
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:38,156
[ Applause ]


199
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:39,806
>> Thanks, Lindsay.


200
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:45,426
As Lindsay just showed, you can


201
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:46,806
use Creative Sets to display


202
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:47,986
different app previews in


203
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:49,486
screenshots that align to


204
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,166
keyword themes or specific


205
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:51,826
audiences.


206
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,576
Since Creative Sets uses App


207
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,606
Store approved assets, this


208
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,556
ensures the best user


209
00:07:58,556 --> 00:07:59,166
experience.


210
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:01,266
I'm here to show you how it's


211
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:01,566
done.


212
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,476
Before we begin, imagine I'm a


213
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:07,236
developer and these are all of


214
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,526
the assets that I've uploaded to


215
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,466
App Store Connect for my app,


216
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:11,526
TripTrek.


217
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,216
TripTrek is an app that lets


218
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:16,676
users document every step of


219
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:17,856
their travels and treks.


220
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:22,096
The first three assets will be


221
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:23,586
used in my default ad.


222
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,436
The default ad matches what


223
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,356
shows in organic search results;


224
00:08:28,646 --> 00:08:30,956
however, there are 2 specific


225
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:32,525
keyword themes that I want to


226
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,385
focus on with my Search Ads


227
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:39,736
campaigns, fitness and mapping.


228
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,726
I can use Creative Sets to


229
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,106
choose the assets that best


230
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:47,466
align to those themes.


231
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,596
Let's go through the steps of


232
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,306
how I do that by adding Creative


233
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,236
Sets to my Search Ads campaigns


234
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:54,186
and ad groups now.


235
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:08,556
Here I am, already logged into


236
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,816
my Search Ads account.


237
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,046
And I'm on the campaigns view.


238
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,576
Let's go ahead and create a new


239
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:15,666
campaign together.


240
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,806
I'll start by clicking Create


241
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:23,356
Campaign, choosing my app,


242
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:28,406
TripTrek, the storefront that I


243
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:30,676
want to promote it in, and I'll


244
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:31,866
give it a campaign name.


245
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:35,346
Let's call this one Active


246
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:35,736
Travel.


247
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:45,786
I'll assign a budget and for now


248
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,466
I'll skip over the daily cap and


249
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:48,796
the campaign negative keywords.


250
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:52,816
We'll go ahead and create the


251
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:54,876
first ad group in this campaign.


252
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:58,636
I'm going to call it fitness to


253
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:00,466
match the keywords that I plan


254
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,036
to bid on.


255
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,976
I want this to run on both iPad


256
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:07,226
and iPhone, so I'll leave that


257
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:07,906
setting as is.


258
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:10,786
And since, of course, I want


259
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:12,846
this to run all day every day,


260
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,586
I'll leave the ad scheduling


261
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:15,296
alone for now.


262
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:19,896
And I'll enter a default max CPT


263
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:20,526
bid.


264
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:24,536
I'm going to leave Search Match


265
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:26,436
on so that Search Ads


266
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:28,586
automatically matches my ads to


267
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:29,646
relevant searches.


268
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,906
And I'm going to choose from


269
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:34,556
some of the recommended keywords


270
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:36,766
some of the keywords that match


271
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:37,786
my fitness theme.


272
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,276
Maybe we'll go with hiking


273
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:43,996
tracker, hiking trails, activity


274
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:45,216
tracker, and step counter.


275
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:47,336
And then I'll add a few more of


276
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:47,876
my own.


277
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:52,596
How about fitness tracker and


278
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,586
fitness challenge, since that's


279
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,626
one of the features in my app.


280
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:01,786
Since I want my ads to show to


281
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,246
all users, I'll leave the


282
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,906
audience settings alone for now


283
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:04,973
too.


284
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:11,446
Here I can see a preview of the


285
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:14,376
default text ad and the default


286
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,886
image ad, which shows alongside


287
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,766
the ads from my Creative Sets


288
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,766
and matches the organic search


289
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,086
result.


290
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:27,826
But, since I want to use assets


291
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:29,516
that are more closely aligned to


292
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,066
my fitness theme, I'm going to


293
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,506
create a Creative Set for that,


294
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,006
so let's go ahead and add one


295
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:37,036
now by clicking Add Creative


296
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:37,976
Set.


297
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:42,166
I'll name this Creative Set


298
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:46,576
Social Hiking and choose the


299
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:47,946
localization language.


300
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,556
The set of languages depends on


301
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:51,456
the storefronts that I'm


302
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,426
promoting in and on the


303
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:54,786
localized assets that I


304
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,116
submitted to App Store Connect.


305
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:58,776
I'll leave this as English for


306
00:11:58,776 --> 00:11:59,026
now.


307
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:02,286
Next, I need to choose the right


308
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,536
combination of assets to create


309
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:05,896
an effective creative set.


310
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,636
Here I can see all of the


311
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:10,156
screenshots and app previews


312
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,156
from the available set of assets


313
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:15,136
on my app product page organized


314
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:20,596
by display size and in the order


315
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:22,056
that I submitted to App Store


316
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:23,206
Connect.


317
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:26,716
I'll only see the display sizes


318
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:28,236
that have enough localized


319
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:30,106
assets to satisfy a Creative


320
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:30,386
Set.


321
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:32,966
In App Store Connect, I had


322
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,936
elected to use the 5.5-inch


323
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:37,606
display, which is why I don't


324
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:39,366
see any other iPhone display


325
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,956
size assets here.


326
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,306
If I'm having trouble


327
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,636
remembering which devices are


328
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:48,456
which display size, I can go to


329
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:50,276
the upper right-hand corner and


330
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,606
click on View Device Display


331
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,706
Sizes to see that information.


332
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:57,266
I'll go ahead and close this


333
00:12:58,866 --> 00:12:58,996
now.


334
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,406
If I hover over an asset, an


335
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,026
icon appears in the lower


336
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,376
left-hand corner and I can click


337
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:07,706
on that to get a closer look.


338
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,746
I can also easily click through


339
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:13,176
to see the other assets as well.


340
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:18,156
Let me close this now and choose


341
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:20,566
the assets for my Creative Set.


342
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:25,896
For the iPhone 5.5-inch display,


343
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,636
I have all portrait assets, so I


344
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:31,486
need to select at least 3 in


345
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,436
order to complete my Creative


346
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:33,726
Set.


347
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:37,636
I can see which of my assets are


348
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:39,276
already being used in the


349
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,456
default ads by this label here


350
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,046
that says default on the first


351
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:44,856
few assets.


352
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,046
I'm going to choose assets that


353
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,316
are different from the default


354
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:49,866
ones and that are aligned with


355
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:52,146
my fitness theme.


356
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:53,966
Here we go.


357
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:54,806
These look good.


358
00:13:56,186 --> 00:14:00,186
And then for the iPad 12.9-inch


359
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:02,516
display size, I have all


360
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:04,446
landscape assets, so I need to


361
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:06,726
select at least one of these in


362
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,356
order for my ads to show on


363
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:08,906
iPad.


364
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,916
I'll go ahead and pick this one


365
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,276
for now.


366
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:16,176
Once I've chosen assets for each


367
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:19,626
display size, I click save and


368
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:22,596
see that my creative set has


369
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,066
been added to my ad group and


370
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,066
now I'm ready to start my


371
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:28,866
campaign.


372
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,966
The Active Travel campaign now


373
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:36,296
appears on my campaigns view and


374
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:37,526
that's how you add a Creative


375
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,676
Set to a new campaign and ad


376
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:40,136
group.


377
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,156
Next, let me show you how to add


378
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:45,786
a Creative Set to an existing


379
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,256
campaign and ad group.


380
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,526
Let's go into my Navigation


381
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:51,126
campaign.


382
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:55,956
And from there, let's go into


383
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,676
the City Maps ad group and I'll


384
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:01,676
click on this new Creative Sets


385
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:02,126
tab.


386
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,366
This is a brand-new view in


387
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,896
Search Ads where I'll be able to


388
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:09,886
see not only how my Creative


389
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:11,966
Sets are performing, but also


390
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,036
how the default text ad and the


391
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,886
default image ad are doing.


392
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,476
I currently only have the


393
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:20,196
default ads running and I don't


394
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:21,786
have any Creative Sets yet for


395
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:22,476
this ad group.


396
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,476
So, I'll add one now by clicking


397
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,116
Add Creative Set.


398
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:33,776
Let's go ahead and name this


399
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:37,636
Creative Set Mapping Features to


400
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,516
align to my mapping theme.


401
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,556
And I'll leave the localization


402
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:44,956
language as English again.


403
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,656
And for the iPhone 5.5-inch


404
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:51,096
display size, I have all


405
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,686
portrait assets, so again I need


406
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,386
to select at least 3 to populate


407
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:55,906
my ad.


408
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:58,336
In this case, I'm going to


409
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,266
choose more than 3 assets,


410
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:01,756
including some that are already


411
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:03,996
used in the default ads, and let


412
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,996
Search Ads automatically create


413
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,676
the various combinations of ads


414
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:14,386
from all of these assets.


415
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:16,586
Search Ads uses machine learning


416
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,796
to continuously optimize to show


417
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:21,456
the best performing ads.


418
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:24,866
Since I'm only interested in


419
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,946
testing ad variations for iPhone


420
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:29,196
at this time, I'm going to elect


421
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,586
to use default assets for iPad,


422
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:34,186
which means only the default ads


423
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:35,526
will show on iPad.


424
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,886
I click save and now I've added


425
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:43,466
my first Creative Set to this ad


426
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:46,496
group and I can create up to 10


427
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:47,966
Creative Sets per ad group.


428
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:51,326
I can return to this view at any


429
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,086
time to check how this Creative


430
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,996
Set is performing versus the


431
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:55,696
default ads.


432
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:05,705
So, that's how I added Creative


433
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,746
Sets for my two keyword themes,


434
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:08,866
fitness and mapping.


435
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:10,786
I hope you'll give this a try


436
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:11,296
yourself.


437
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:13,006
Now, let me hand it back to


438
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:13,415
Lindsay.

Thank you.


442
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:25,435
So, to summarize, Creative Sets


443
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,256
use App Store approved assets,


444
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,916
so it continues ensuring a


445
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,286
really great customer

00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:32,016
experience.


447
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:34,636
And now with more ad variations,


448
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:36,746
you can more closely align your


449
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:39,206
ad images to specific keyword


450
00:17:39,246 --> 00:17:41,346
themes for audiences and our


451
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,486

452
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:46,136
always achieve the best results.
