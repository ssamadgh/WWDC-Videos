DESCRIPTION:

GKTank is a sample application that shows how to use the GKSession and GKPeerPickerController classes in the GameKit framework to add Peer-to-Peer Connectivity to an application.

The 'TankViewController" class defined in the TankViewController.h handles the GameKit related Peer-to-Peer Connectivity implemenation, and is also where most of the other game logic is located.

Note: This sample application does not cover all the possible things you can or will need to do in your application to handle all possible events that could occur in a networked application environment.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

This sample application is intended to be run on the device, and requires two devices to exercise the Peer-to-Peer Connectivity functionality.
