make the watch more personal to

223

Let's start with watch faces.

225
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,805
Now, Apple Watch is great for

226
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,040
quickly glancing at information.

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,839
And many people are using a

228
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,409
watch face like this today.

229
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,476
And now, you need to choose what

230
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,611
information shows up here.

231
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,246
So for example weather, calendar

232
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,579
and workouts, or maybe you'd

233
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,815
like to look at the date and

234
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,316
reminders and sunset.

235
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:19,885
The information that you like to

236
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,019
see actually varies based on

237
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,554
time and your location and your

238
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:23,722
routines.

239

more a proactive assistant

need when you need it.

247
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,267
And we've created a new watch

This is the new Siri watch face.

applied on iOS.

We're using machine learning to

262

adapt automatically based on

263

your routines and the apps that

264
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,023
you use when you use them.

265
00:10:58,023 --> 00:10:59,057
So in the morning, I might see

266
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:01,126
for example, can you time in my

267
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:01,959
first meeting.

268
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,428
And if I rotate the Crown, I can

269
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:05,597
see more information from Siri.

270
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:07,064
For example, reminders or even

271
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,834

272
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,068
time last year or maybe from

00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,136
this location.

274
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:12,137
And throughout the day, whenever

275
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,738
you raise your wrist, the face

276
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,973

information for you.

278
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:17,776
So for example at noon, I might

279
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,144
see a reminder to make a call

280
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:20,445
and I might get a pass to a

281
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:21,313
flight that I'm taking that

282

afternoon.

283
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,582
So, relevant passes in Wallet

284
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,415
can appear here right in the

285

apps.

287
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,353
Now, at the end of the day, I

288
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:29,387
might see what time the sun is

289
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:30,622
going to set and also, I can get

290
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:32,723

in the home app at night.

292
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,694

349
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,816
personalized to you.

350
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:05,817
There'll be "Close Your Rings"

351
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:06,818
more often.

352
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:07,953
So you might start off each day

353
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,187
with some inspiration by

354
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:11,256
receiving an update like this.

355
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,089
This lets you know if you're

356
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,425
close to accomplishing an

357
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,659
achievement or what you can do

358
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,894
to match yesterday's goals.

359
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,395
And these are all personalized

360
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:18,196
to you.

361
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:19,297
And as part of the smarter

362
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:21,132
coaching, we're also introducing

363
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,367
monthly challenges.

364
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,735
And these challenges are

365
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:25,804
designed to help you either beat

366
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,838
or repeat something that you

367
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:27,872
accomplish or came close to

368
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,574
doing and they're all achievable

369
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:30,742
because they're based on your

370
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:32,010
real history.

371
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,245
And like every great coach, we

372
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,346
want to celebrate your success

373
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,847
so we've added a little bit more

374
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,148
fun when you close your rings or

375
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,416
earn an achievement.

[ Applause ]

377
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:43,021
So you get smaller celebrations

378
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:44,155
for everyday successes and

379
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,589
bigger celebrations for harder

380
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,259
to reach milestones.

381
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,260
Now, we've also enhanced the

382
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,694
Workout App to be even easier to

383
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,363
use and more powerful.

384
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,664
Starting with the new UI where

385
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,064
quick start is right up front,

386
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,166
you can just tap and go.

387
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,434
It's much easier.

388
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:58,236
And customers have really loved

389
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,771
the new swimming capabilities in

390
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,006
Siris too.

391
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,406
And we're now enhancing the pool

392
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,542
swim workout with auto-sets.

393
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,944
So just by taking a rest at the

394
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:07,045
edge of the pool, it'll

395
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,613
automatically mark each set of

396
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:09,614
swimming that you're doing.

397
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,016
And at the end, you'll even get

398
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,217
your distance for each stroke

399
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,151
type and your pace for each set

400
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:15,520
that you're doing.

401
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,355
We also are creating-- It's

402
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,690
great, pool swim thing is very

403
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,724
popular.

404
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:20,926
We've also created some custom

405
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,394
motion and heart rate algorithms

406
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,695
for a new workout type called

407
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:24,629
High Intensity Interval

408
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:25,430
Training.

409
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,263
Now, this is one of the most

410
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:27,432
popular workouts in the world.

411
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:28,466
So we know it's going to be a

412
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,401
favorite for a lot of you when

413
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,169
you start using it.

414
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,304
Now, if you like to do more than

415
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,005
one workout in a row, it's now

416
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,907
super easy to just swipe over

417
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,409
during a current workout and

418
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,710
then add another one by pressing

419
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,744
the plus button.

420
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,379
You just press plus and I can

421
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,580
continue with another workout.

422
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,949
For example, I might do outdoor

423
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:44,983
cycling here.

424
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:47,051
I just tap and I continue, super

425
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,753
easy now to do multiple workouts

426
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,522
in a single session.

427
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:55,293
[ Applause ]

428
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:56,328
Now, many people are doing the

429
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,029
workouts indoors at a gym.

430
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,198
And when you use gym equipment,

431
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:01,433
it has data the Apple Watch

432
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,667
doesn't have and the watch has

433
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,302
data the gym equipment doesn't

434
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:05,136
have.

435
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,304
So you end up with numbers like

436
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:07,539
calories and distance that don't

437
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,606
quite match.

438
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,075
So in watchOS 4, we've come up

439
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,243
with a great solution to this.

440
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:13,445
We're enabling for the first

441
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,280
time two-way data exchange in

442
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,781
real-time with gym equipment.

443
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,616
So you'll be able to simply tap

444
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:20,352
your Apple Watch, on an NFC

445
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,786
reader on the gym equipment.

446
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:22,720
Your watch will automatically

447
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,755
launch the Workout App and you

448
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:24,589
can connect.

449
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,957
And then your heart rate is read

450
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,225
by the watch and sent to the

451
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:28,059
equipment.

452
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,394
And data like incline and speed

453
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,528
is sent from the equipment to

454
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:31,363
your watch.

455
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,430
And when you start and stop the

456
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,665
workout in your gym machine, it

457
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:34,699
does the same thing on your

458
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:35,500
watch.

459
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,434
So now, all the information

460
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,136
matches, it's much easier and

461
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:39,738
it's a lot more accurate.

462
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,939
Now, this is being supported by

463
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,674
the largest gym manufacturers in

464
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:44,776
the world, provided about 80% of

465
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,377
equipment in gyms today.

466
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,545
And Apple Watch-enabled

467
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:48,780
equipment will be rolling out

468
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,515
starting this fall.

Now let's talk about music.

471
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,392
Apple Watch paired with AirPods

472
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,593
has really become a magical

473

combination.

474
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,228
And where redesigning the music

475
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,330
app and watch makes this a

476
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,998
really great experience.

477
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:08,133
With the new music app, we're

478
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,401
going to automatically sync

480
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,170
love to listen to.

481
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,971
So for example, it'll

482
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:13,905
automatically get your Apple

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,778
And the app simply presents some

487
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,212
beautiful album art and playlist

488

00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,501
Next, let's look at the new

521
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:19,737
intelligent Siri watch face.

522
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,272
Here in the morning, I could see

523
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,240
things like the weather for

524
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,809
today and my upcoming events.

525
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,112
Later today, I'm heading back to

526
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,413
San Francisco to see my parents.

527
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,515
And in the afternoon, the Siri

528
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,117
face will proactively update to

529
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,518
tell me how long it will take me

530
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,520
to get there.

531
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,721
Tonight, we're going to see the

532
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:37,989
new "Alien" movie, which I'm

533
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,257
super excited about.

534
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:41,359
No one spoil it for me.

535
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,659
For any content in the Siri

536
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,462
face, I could tap directly into

537
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,231
the app for more details.

538
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,765
Here for example, the Siri face

539
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,367
has my ticket so tonight, I can

540
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,202
just raise my wrist and with one

541
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,871
tap, they'll be ready.

542
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,373
The Siri face also shows me

543
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,875
timely content like photo

544
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,810

Here's a news headline picked

546
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,779
for me by the brand new news app

547
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,349
now available on Apple Watch.

548
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,150
In the app, I can view stunning

549
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,086
photos, glance at top news

550
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,621
stories throughout the day and

551
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,256
save them for later to be read

552
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,892
on my phone.

553
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,393
We've also integrated our new

554
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,195
Activity coaching notifications

555
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:19,496
directly into the Siri face.

your move goal.

562
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,640
I did a lot of nervous pacing

563
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,208
before this so now, I just need

564
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,377
to take a 16-minute walk.

Let's close those rings.

There's a lot more coming in

watchOS 4 including, for

589
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,000
example, a new flashlight in the

590
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,235
control center, which you can

591
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,535
also use as a blinking safety

592

evening run.

here.

596
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,040
Now, we of course have a number

597
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,908
of updates that enable great

some new UI capabilities.

603
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,951
And we're also now supporting

604
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,353
native Core Bluetooth on the

605
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,821

with small devices around you.

612

connects to a sensor on your

we said there might be-- this

Now, High Sierra is all about

700
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,936
deep technologies that provide a

701

powerful platform for future

innovations on the Mac.

703

But we couldn't help ourselves,

704
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,644
we also added some refinements.

705
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,813
And it starts with Safari.

706
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,514
Now, Safari is known for its

707
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:05,216
efficiency and it's a legendary

708

709
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:09,554
incredibly fast.

710
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,622
In fact, we benchmarked Safari

711
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:13,424
on the same hardware running

712
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,593
macOS and Windows with all the

713
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,895
popular browsers and Safari

714
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:19,864
smokes them in benchmark after

Safari tops them all.

That's right, Safari is the

ECMAScript 5.

726
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:43,521
We can see Safari delivers 80%

faster performance than Chrome.

728

Now, in addition to being

729
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,361
tremendously fast, Safari also

730
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,296
helps give you a serene browsing

732
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:54,432
Now, you know, sometimes you go

shouldn't be playing video and

746

You can always push play.

748

It's not about blocking ads, the

starts with search.

searches based on recency,

778
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,448

00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:44,328
And when it comes to data, the

865
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:46,297
fundamentals are in the file

866
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,231
system.

867
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:49,066
Now, the Mac File System has its

868
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:52,002
roots actually, HFS from 30

869
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:53,738
years ago.

870
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,106
Well, a lot has changed since

871
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:55,940
then.

872
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,974
We have a lot of flash drives or

873
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,509
storage is a billion times

874
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,578
larger and it's time for more

875
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,580
modern file system.

876
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,714
So, I'm pleased to announce that

877
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:05,349
we're bringing the Apple File

878
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,251
System to macOS as our new

879
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:08,452
default.

880
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:12,890
[ Applause and Cheering ]

881
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,292
Now, APFS is a thoroughly modern

882
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,495
file system, 64-bit top to

883
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,262
bottom.

884
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:19,730
It's safe and secure with

885
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,499
built-in crash protection and

886
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,267
native encryption.

887
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:25,202
And it's ultra responsive with

888
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:26,837
modern features like instant

889
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,873
file and directory cloning and

890
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,641
high performance parallellized

891
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:32,243
metadata operations.

892
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,244
Now, what does that really mean

893
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,311
in practice?

894
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,913
Well, let's take a look at a

895
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:38,048
simple file duplication inside

896
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:38,883
of Sierra.

897
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,317
So we're going to go up to the

898
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:41,252
File menu.

899
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,520
It's like duplicate on this very

900
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,521
large video files.

901
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,089
And it's going to copy.

902
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:45,889
And just like you'd expect,

903
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,757
there's a lot of data to be

904
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:48,359
copied here so it takes a little

905
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,294
while, just about done, there we

906
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:52,129
go.

907
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:53,997
Now, let's watch that in High

908
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:54,832
Sierra.

909
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:55,666
Well, we're going to go up to

910
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,867
the File menu, we're going to

911
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:59,503
subduplicate, and we're done.

912
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:04,875
[ Applause and Cheering ]

913
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,278
Next up, video.

914
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,879
Now, the current standard in

915
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:10,347
video is H.264.

916
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:12,283
In fact, H.264 has really

917
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,317
enabled the revolution of

918
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:15,186
streaming HD video on the

919
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,153
Internet.

920
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:16,987
But, of course, the game is

921
00:29:16,987 --> 00:29:21,792
moved from HD to 4K and 4K high

922
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,928
dynamic range video.

923
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,429
And there's a new standard to

924
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:27,665
support this, it's H.265 or

925
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,499
HEVC.

926
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,501
And you want your video to look

927
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:32,903
great, preserve all the detail

928
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:35,573
and color, and HEVC does it

929
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,275
while saving up to 40% better

930
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,110
compression than H.264.

931
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,745
Now, we're building in software

932
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:42,812
encoder support in the High

933
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:45,449
Sierra for all Macs and hardware

934
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:48,319
acceleration of HEVC for the

935
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,420
newest Macs.

936
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,754
And we're also building it into

937
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:52,923
ProTools, like Final Cut,

938
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:55,526
Motion, and Compressor.

939
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:56,794
Now, I want to return to our

940
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,129
main story which is graphics and

941
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:02,065
graphics are all about the GPU.

942
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,534
The GPU has been the performance

943
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:06,036
superstar of the last decade

944
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,638
delivering incredible gains in

945
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,040
computational performance.

946
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,408
Now, our API for

947
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:13,043
high-performance graphics is

948
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:13,811
Metal.

949
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,012
And developers have taken

950
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:16,213
amazing advantage of Metal.

951
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:18,048
This is Dawn of War III from

952
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,550
Feral Interactive, incredible

953
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,851
graphics.

954
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,486
This is DaVinci Resolve from

955
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:24,622
Blackmagic which can accelerate

956
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,423
many editing operations.

957
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,691
And, of course, we even use

958
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:29,793
Metal inside of photos for doing

959
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:31,094
machine learning in identifying

960
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,229
your photos.

961
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:33,864
But we've learned a lot working

962
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:34,832
with developers and their

963
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,467
adoption of Metal and we have a

964
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,835
new version to announce today.

965
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,203
And you'll never guess what we

966
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:40,504
called it.

967
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:41,038
It's Metal 2.

968
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:42,973
[ Laughter ]

969
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,842
Now, Metal 2 is tremendously

970
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:46,543
fast.

971
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:47,610
In fact, it has great

972
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:49,480
optimizations and new APIs that

973
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,182
when adopted, deliver another 10

974
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:54,118
times improvement in draw call

975
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:54,952
throughput.

976
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:55,786
Now, some of you remember when

977
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:57,488
Metal first came out, it itself

978
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,789
had a 10 times improvement over

979
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:59,623
OpenGL.

980
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:00,724
You can multiply those numbers

981
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:01,425
together.

982
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:02,359
That's a hundred times

983
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,427
improvement.

984
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:05,396
Now, we've also provided

985
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:09,399
better-- sorry, debugging and

986
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,035
performance analysis tools for

987
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,069
you to optimize your app for

988
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:12,903
Metal.

989
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:14,171
And we're so excited about the

990
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:16,073
advances in Metal 2 that we've

991
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,309
taken the Mac Window Server and

992
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,777
put it on top of Metal,

993
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,645
accelerating things like Mission

994
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:22,479
Control.

995
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,614
And some of our most challenging

996
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:24,949
system animations are now

997
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,451
buttery smooth all the time.

998
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,553
Now, Metal is not just about

999
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:30,387
graphics.

1000
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,255
We're also using it for machine

1001
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,090
learning.

1002
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,958
It can now accelerate-- yes, we

1003
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,860
have Metal performance shaders

1004
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,861
to accelerate all kinds of deep

1005
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:40,764
learning algorithms.

1006
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:41,931
Another piece of Metal news

1007
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,234
today is Metal for external

1008
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,970
graphics.

1009
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,272
So, you know our MacBooks have

1010
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,206
this tremendous balance of

1011
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:52,876
portability and power.

1012
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,144
But sometimes for some

1013
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:56,046
workflows, you need even more

1014
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:56,880
power.

1015
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,748
You want to take advantage of

1016
00:31:57,748 --> 00:32:00,317
the incredible Thunderbolt IO on

1017
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,519
your MacBook Pros to access

1018
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,955
external graphics.

1019
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:05,956
So we're going to be making this

1020
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:07,591
possible in Metal 2.

1021
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,392
Now, we're starting with the

1022
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:10,361
Developer Kit that will be

1023
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,295
available today.

1024
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:13,263
You can actually order a

1025
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:14,732
Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with a

1026
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,935
high-performance AMD GPU and

1027
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,602
tune your apps for

1028
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:20,838
high-performance external

1029
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:21,672
graphics.

1030
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,806
And then we'll be rolling out

1031
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:25,109
support to all of our customers

1032
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,444
in the months to come.

1033
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,480
Now, with these graphics power,

1034
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,714
we're really doubling down on

1035
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:31,982
our focus on Pro content

1036
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:33,149
creation.

1037
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,752
And that's increasingly about VR

1038
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,421
content creation.

1039
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:41,025
And so, we're bringing Metal for

1040
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,526
VR to High Sierra.

[ Applause ]

1042
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,831
Now Metal is delivering a

1043
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:50,533
VR-optimized display pipeline

1044
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:51,835
that provides extremely high

1045
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:53,170
performance.

1046
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,205
And we're optimizing our Pro

1047
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,439
apps like Final Cut for doing

1048
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,574
things like editing spherical

1049
00:32:57,574 --> 00:32:59,176
video right inside the VR

environment.

1051
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,912
We're also working with Valve.

1052
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,447
They're bringing the SteamVR,

1053
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,848
SVK to the Mac.

1054
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:07,851
And we work with Unity and

1055
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,887
Unreal to bring their engines

1056
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,489
for VR to the Mac.

00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:16,860
[ Applause and Cheering ]

1058
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,094
It's really cool and you might

1059
00:33:18,095 --> 00:33:19,329
just be seeing a little bit more

1060
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:20,764
from us later today on this

1061
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:21,665
topic.

1062
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:24,168
So that's a quick look at macOS.

1063
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,902
Some great technologies with the

1064
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:29,039
Apple File System, HEVC Video

1065
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,941
and incredible graphics with

1066
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:33,310
Metal 2 support for external

1067
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,279
graphics and VR support of the

1068
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,481
Mac and, of course, a bunch of

1069
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:39,316
fantastic refinements.

1070
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:41,185
Now, macOS High Sierra is

1071
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,654
available for all of you today

1072
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,688
as a developer beta.

1073
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:46,523
And if you sign up at

1074
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:48,891
beta.apple.com, we'll also have

1075
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:50,828
a public beta available later at

1076
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,296
this month and, of course, it's

1077
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,931
shipping to everyone as a free

1078
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,667
upgrade this fall on all systems

1079
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,168
that support Sierra.

1080
00:33:58,168 --> 00:34:00,536
Now, that's your update on macOS

1081
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:01,638
High Sierra and I'm going to

1082

>> Thank you, Craig.

1089
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,690
So, we have some great updates

1090
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,158
to talk about today that span

1091
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:23,025
much of the Mac product line.

1092
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:25,629
And let's begin with the iMac.

1093
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,230
Now, the iMac has been the gold

1094
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,765
standard of desktops for many

1095
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,067
years but we're going to raise

1096
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,802
the bar once again.

1097
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:33,303
And as always on the iMac, it

1098
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:35,471
starts with the display.

1099
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:37,441
Because the 4K and 5K Retina

1100
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,841
iMac displays with their high

1101
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,777
resolution, excellent brightness

1102
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:42,779
and P3 color gamut, are the best

1103
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,281
displays on any desktop.

1104
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:45,716
But we're going to make them

1105
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:46,984
even better.

1106
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,784
So these new displays are now

1107
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:50,386
going to be 500 nits.

1108
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,289
That's 43% brighter than the

1109
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,824
previous generation.

1110
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,459
And for the first time, we're

1111
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,560
going to support 10-bit

1112
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,861
dithering, which means these

1113
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,229
displays can reproduce up to a

1114
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:01,531
billion colors.

1115
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,733
So, your content is going to

1116
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,201
look more true to life than ever

1117
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,502
before.

1118
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:06,937
Now, in addition, we've got some

1119
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,505
great internal updates for these

1120
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:09,306
iMacs.

1121
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,440
So we'll start with the CPU

1122
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,775
because the whole line is moving

1123
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,610
to Intel's 7th-generation Core

1124
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,512
Processor, also known as Kaby

1125
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:16,346
Lake.

1126
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:17,447
Now, Kaby Lake gets this better

1127
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,183
base and turbo frequencies for

1128
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,817
more performance as well as

1129
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:23,120
hardware-based 10-bit HEVC

1130
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,555
decode which is great for

1131
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,990
playing back high quality video.

1132
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,292
In addition, these iMacs are

1133
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,359
getting a boost when it comes to

1134
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,727
memory capacity.

1135
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:32,962
So the 21.5-inch systems can now

1136
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:34,731
be configured with up to 32 gigs

1137
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:35,566
of memory.

1138
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,167
And the 27-inch can go all the

1139
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,535
way up to 64 gigabytes of

1140
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:39,368
memory.

1141
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,437
Both of those are twice what the

1142
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:42,973
previous generation can do.

1143
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,508
Now, fast storage has always

1144
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:45,975
been a key part of the iMac.

1145
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,077
And so, we're going to now make

1146
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:49,146
our Fusion Drive standard on all

1147
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,280
27-inch configs.

1148
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,615
And it's also going to be

1149
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:52,816
standard on the high-end

1150
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:55,185
21.5-inch config as well.

1151
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:57,354
In addition, our SSD options are

1152
00:35:57,354 --> 00:35:59,423
going to be up to 50% faster and

1153
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,758
now available up to 2 terabytes.

1154
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:04,361
And the iMacs are getting an IO

1155
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:05,395
upgrade as well because we're

1156
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:07,698
giving them two USB-C connectors

1157
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,399
which support Thunderbolt 3.

1158
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,601
And we think our customers

1159
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,102
especially our Pro users are

1160
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:12,903
really going to love this

1161
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:13,937
because you can do some cool

1162
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:15,205
things like hook up a

1163
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:16,907
high-performance RAID array and

1164
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,909
an external 5K display at the

1165
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,611
same time.

1166
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,912
So now, let's talk about

1167
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:22,745
graphics.

1168
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:23,880
And as you heard earlier, we're

1169
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,349
investing heavily in graphic

1170
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,050
software technologies like Metal

1171
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,884
2.

1172
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:29,186
Well, we're also investing in

1173
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,120
graphics hardware.

1174
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,888
And every configuration in this

1175
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:33,223
new iMac line is going to get a

1176
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:35,025
big bump in its graphics

1177
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,326
performance.

1178
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:37,060
So we'll start with the

1179
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,161
entry-level iMac.

1180
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,463
Now this system gets a boost in

1181
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,365
its integrated GPU by way of

1182
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,200
Intel's Iris Plus Graphics which

1183
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,636
now has 64 megabytes of eDRAM.

1184
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,603
And the performance that we're

1185
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:47,537
getting out of this is pretty

1186
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:49,071
amazing because this system is

1187
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:51,174
up to 80% faster in graphics

1188
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:52,509
than the previous generation.

1189
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:56,813
[ Applause and Cheering ]

1190
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:59,449
Now next up is the 21.5-inch

1191
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,218
iMac with Retina 4K display.

1192
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,886
And the big news here is that

1193
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:03,987
we're going to be moving to

1194
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:05,455
discrete graphics and making it

1195
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:07,857
standard on all 4K iMacs.

1196
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,326
And that's going to come-- There

1197
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:10,160
you go.

1198
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,993
And that's going to come in this

1199
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:13,297
Radeon Pro series GPUs with up

1200
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,599
to 4 gigabytes of VRAM.

1201
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,067
And again, this move to discrete

1202
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,001
graphics yield to pretty

1203
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:19,903
spectacular performance increase

1204
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:21,571
because this new system is up to

1205
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:23,206
three times faster than the

1206
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,241
previous generation for

1207
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,475

[ Applause and Cheering ]

1209
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:31,415
Now, lastly, we have our 27-inch

1210
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,215
iMAc.

1211
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:33,050
And this is our most popular

1212
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,885
desktop for our Pro customers.

1213
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,186
So obviously, it's going to get

1214
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:37,321
a bump in graphics today as

1215
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,087
well.

1216
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:38,955
So it's going to have this

1217
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:41,525
Radeon Pro 500 series GPUs with

1218
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,061
up to 8 gigabytes of VRAM.

1219
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,162
And again, we get a great

1220
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:45,995
performance uplift.

1221
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,664
In fact, this 27-inch iMac can

1222
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:50,167
now deliver up to 5.5 teraflops

powered by my Mac.

1282
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:34,404
On my left motion controller, I

1283
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:35,739
have my Radial Menu, which

1284
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,607
accesses my artist palette.

1285
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:38,909
Now on the right, I have the

1287

1288
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:43,647
So, let's try that out.

1289
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,081
>> All right.

1290
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:46,783

>> Let's see.

1294

Let me open my content browser.

1296
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:54,357
dress my scene.

in.

1301
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,131
We've actually set up the smart

1302
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,365
assets so they know exactly

1303
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:03,133
where to come in for their

1304
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,935

Can we go wide?

1307
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:10,207
>> Sure. I can grab on to them

1308
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,741
with two hands and scale myself

1309
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:12,576
up.

1310
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,711
I can also use this to rotate

1311
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,314
the world around me.

1312
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,214
>> Very cool.

>> I have a TIE fighter here too

1314
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:21,985

Can we have a squadron of those

1322

00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,102
So, over there by the castle.

1326
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:41,004

Metal 2 and Unreal's-- or Epic's

1371
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:30,880
Unreal Engine would enable the

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,782
next generation of storytellers.

1373
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:33,817
We use this technology in our

filmmaking every day for virtual

1377
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:40,123
And that means that this

1378

immersive content can be made by

1379

the same people that bring you

the films.

1381
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:45,462
That's incredibly powerful.

At Lucasfilm and ILMxLab, we're

1383

looking forward to using our

1384

Macs to create new experiences

1385
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,067
as we invite people everywhere

That was awesome.

1393
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:06,416
So that is our update to the

1394
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:07,250
iMac line.

1395
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,819
And to recap, they have the best

1396
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:11,888
Mac displays we've ever made,

1397
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:13,790
faster processors, higher memory

1398
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,159
capacity, super fast storage,

1399
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,827
Thunderbolt 3, and as you saw,

1400
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:22,732
incredible graphics performance.

1401
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:26,002
So, here is the line and-- but

1402
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:28,204
there's one more change because

1403
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:29,239
we're going to bring even more

1404
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,374
value to the iMac product line.

1405
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:33,209
For the first time ever, we're

1406
00:43:33,209 --> 00:43:34,711
going to have a 4K iMac that

1407
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:37,513
starts at just $1299.

[ Applause ]

1409
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,189
But the updates don't stop with

1410
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:47,589
just the iMac because we're

1411
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,958
refreshing our notebooks today

1412
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:49,793
as well.

1413
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,928
And together, the MacBook and

1414
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:53,029
MacBook Pro make up the

1415
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:54,497
strongest line of notebooks

1416
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:55,464
we've ever had.

1417
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:56,833
But we're going to make them

1418
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:57,901
even better because we're moving

1419
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,969
to Kaby Lake here as well.

1420
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,938
And we're bringing faster SSDs

1421
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:04,307
to our MacBook and faster

1422
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:06,509
standard graphics to the 15-inch

1423
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:08,044
MacBook Pro.

1424
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:09,379
So a great performance bump

1425
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:11,181
across the board.

1426
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,248
So here is that lineup.

1427
00:44:12,248 --> 00:44:13,316
But just like the iMac, we're

1428
00:44:13,316 --> 00:44:14,616
going to bring more value here

1429
00:44:14,617 --> 00:44:16,019
as well because we're going to

1430
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,520
have a new configuration of the

1431
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,489
13-inch MacBook Pro that also

1432

So there you'd have it.

1435
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:30,333
We've updated seven of our most

1436
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,669
popular Macs and the MacBook Air

1437
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:33,937
is going to get a bump in

1438
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:34,971
megahertz as well.

1439
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,873
And even better, they're all

1440
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,508

environment.

1444
00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,016
And so as with all our products,

1445
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:48,351
we've been working really hard

1446
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,919
to ensure that these new Macs

1447
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,621
are free of harmful chemicals,

1448

very energy efficient and highly

00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:54,858
recyclable.

1450
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,893
So that's everything we're

1451
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:58,194
updating today.

1452
00:44:58,194 --> 00:44:59,562
But, it's not actually

1453
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:00,529
everything we want to show you

1454

today.

1455
00:45:01,364 --> 00:45:03,666
Now the iMac line has incredible

1456
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:04,467
breadth.

1457
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,535
It spans from an entry level

1458
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:06,935
system that's perfect for use at

1459
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:08,805
home or in a school, all the way

1460
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:09,839
up through that powerhouse

But that said, there's another

1465
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:19,349
class of Pro users who would

1466
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,283
love to be able to take

1467
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:21,918
advantage of the iMac's display

1468
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:23,419
and design, but they need

1469
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:25,020
workstation class performance

1470
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,422
that can't possibly fit into an

1471
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,724
all-in-one.

1472
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,125
Well, we wanted to challenge

1473
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,193
that assumption, and so we've

1474
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:31,694
been working really hard to see

1475
00:45:31,694 --> 00:45:33,396
just how far we can push the

1476

Now, the first thing you'll

1488
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:17,941
notice, it features the same

1489
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,144
great design as our 27-inch iMac

1490

but it's in this seriously

1491
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:25,615
badass space gray finish.

1492

And with that stunning new color

00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:28,918
and gorgeous 5K display, this is

1494
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:30,053
without a doubt the most

1495
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,288
beautiful iMac we've ever made.

1496

But it's also going to be by far

In fact, this would be the most

powerful Mac we've ever made

1501

Because we actually are going to

1504
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,005
put workstation class

1505
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:50,573

5K iMac design.

1507
00:46:52,508 --> 00:46:53,910
Now to do that, the team had to

1508
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,444
completely rethink the thermal

1509
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,313
architecture, and they came up

1510
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:58,915
with this really efficient dual

1511
00:46:58,915 --> 00:47:00,783
centrifugal fan solution which

1512
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:02,518
generates significantly more

airflow than a traditional iMac.

1514
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:05,622
In fact, the iMac Pro has a

1515
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,557
greater than 80% increase in

1516

cooling capacity.

1517
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:10,026
So that means we can deliver

1518
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:11,794
unbelievable performance while

1519

we've gone this far, let's get

[ Applause and Cheering ]

1538
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:47,863
That is a ton of compute power.

1539
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,998
But we didn't want to stop there

1540
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:49,999
because we wanted to go really

1541
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,935
big on graphics as well.

1542
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,203
So the iMac Pro is going to use

1543
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:55,738
AMD's Radeon Vega graphics.

1544
00:47:55,738 --> 00:47:57,774
This is a brand new workstation

1545
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,509
class graphics architecture.

1546
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,210
It features a completely new GPU

1547
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,112
core and high bandwidth on

1548
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:03,947
packaged memory.

1549
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,782
It's going to be available with

1550
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,184
up to 16 gigabytes of VRAM and

1551
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:10,420
over 400 gigabytes per second of

1552
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,254
memory bandwidth.

1553
00:48:11,254 --> 00:48:12,522
And we aren't going to use an

1554
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,324
entry level configuration here

1555
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,792
because our implementation is

1556
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,926
going to offer up to 11

1557
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:18,661
teraflops of single precision

1558
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:19,829
compute power.

1559
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:21,197
That's three times more than the

1560
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,899
best GPU in the Mac Pro.

1561
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,968
But it actually gets even better

1562
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,636
because this Radeon Vega GPU can

1563
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:28,838
also do half precision compute.

1564
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,239
So that means the iMac Pro can

1565
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,509
deliver up to 22 teraflops of

1566
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:36,412
half precision computation.

1567
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:37,846
This is a really big deal for

1568
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:39,048
things like machine learning

1569
00:48:39,048 --> 00:48:40,082
development.

1570
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,484
So the iMac Pro as you can see

1571
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:42,752
is going to be a monster when it

1572
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:44,320
comes to graphics, but we didn't

1573
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,655
want to stop there either.

1574
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:46,456
So we're going to let you

1575
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,358
configure it with up to 128

1576
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,393
gigabytes of ECC memory.

1577
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:51,794
That's twice what you can do on

1578
00:48:51,794 --> 00:48:54,497

1582
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:05,140
Now, the iMac Pro is also going

1583
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,376
to have a full complement of

1584
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,144
high performance I/O including

1585
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,145
four Thunderbolt 3 ports and for

1586

the first time ever in any Mac,

And with all that cutting edge

1590
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:21,991

1591

amazing things.

1592
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,794

1594

1595
00:49:28,164 --> 00:49:29,232
could ever do that.

1596
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,266
And when you combine that with

1597
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:32,035
the internal display, that means

1598
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,837
the iMac Pro can drive up to 44

this iMac Pro is going to be an

1611

awesome workstation for things

Now speaking of workstations, we

1619

what's on the market.

1622
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:14,644
And so, if you were to go out

1623
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,212
and build a comparably spec

1624

00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:06,315
People had a lot of fun with

1704
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:07,149
these.

1705
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:08,351
And now in iOS 11, we're making

1706
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,719
them more discoverable and ever

1707
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,520
with this redesigned app drawer.

1708
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,855
You can see you have your apps

1709
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:14,023
accessible right there at the

1710
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:15,224
bottom of the screen with just a

1711
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:17,059
tap, you can bring them up,

1712
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:19,095
scroll through them and tap into

1713
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:20,096
any app.

1714
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:20,997
It's really easy.

1715
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,265
It's going to make it a lot of

1716
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,833
fun for you to use your apps and

1717
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:24,667
stickers.

1718
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,335
Now, the big story with messages

1719
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:28,738
though is messages in iCloud.

1720
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,640
Because now with your iMessages

1721
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,174
and iCloud, when you sign in to

1722
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:35,378
another new device, well all of

1723
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,612
your conversations are

1724
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:38,514
automatically synchronized.

1725
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:43,252
[ Applause ]

1726
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:44,487
In fact, they stay in sync.

1727
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:45,388
So if you want to delete an

1728
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,555
embarrassing message that you

1729
00:53:46,555 --> 00:53:47,723
don't want in your transcript,

1730
00:53:47,723 --> 00:53:49,792
well it goes away everywhere,

1731
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,460
which is kind of nice.

1732
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,963
So, this, of course, allows us

1733
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:55,464
to optimize your device storage

1734
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:56,465
because with your messages in

1735
00:53:56,465 --> 00:53:57,867
the cloud, we only need to keep

1736
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,769
your most recent messages cached

1737
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,037
on the device and so that makes

1738
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,239
for smaller and faster backups

1739
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,341
that is available for iOS and

1740
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:06,174
the Mac.

1741
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,310
And, of course, your messages

1742
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,645
remain end-to-end encrypted.

1743
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:11,781
Next, Apple Pay.

1744
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,716
So we love using Apple Pay to

1745
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:15,116
buy things at retail.

1746
00:54:15,117 --> 00:54:17,219
In fact, Apple Pay is the number

1747
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,890
one contactless payment service

1748
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,957
on mobile devices.

1749
00:54:21,957 --> 00:54:23,392
And by the end of the year, it

1750
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:24,493
will be available in more than

1751
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:28,331
50% of retailers here in the US.

1752
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,265
Yeah.

[ Applause ]

1754

But in addition of paying at

1755
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:34,603
retail, we use Apple Pay in

1756
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:37,073
apps, we use it in the web.

1757
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,774
There was one final frontier we

1758
00:54:38,774 --> 00:54:40,942
wanted to conquer and that's

1759
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:43,279
Apple Pay for person to person

1760
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,513
payments.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

1762
00:54:52,054 --> 00:54:53,723
Now, it's super simple because

1763
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,991
it's integrated right in to

1764
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:58,527
messages as an iMessage App.

[ Applause and Cheering ]

1766
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:06,634
So you can send and receive

1767
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:08,204
money right in your transcript.

1768
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,405
Of course, when you send it, you

1769
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:11,841
authenticate securely with Touch

1770
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:12,674
ID.

1771
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:16,045
And if you receive money with

1772
00:55:16,045 --> 00:55:17,380
iMessage, it goes to your Apple

1773

Pay cash card.

1774
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,782
And from there, well you can

1775
00:55:19,782 --> 00:55:20,816
send it on to friends and

1776

family, if you are charitable,

1777
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:24,520
you can make Apple Pay purchases

1778

at retail or on the web.

1779

And, of course, you can pull it

1780
00:55:27,623 --> 00:55:28,724
out and transfer it to your

1781
00:55:28,724 --> 00:55:29,558
bank.

1782
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:30,726
And it's available across all

1783
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:32,228
these iOS devices and Apple

So next, let's turn to Siri.

1788
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:44,038
Now, Siri is used monthly for

1789
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,110
more than 375 million devices.

1790

It's absolutely huge.

1791
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:50,713
And it's available in more

1792
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:52,548
languages, in more countries

1793

than any other system, 21

languages and 36 countries.

1795
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:58,654
So for iOS 11, we're making a

1796
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:00,456
big upgrade to your primary

1797
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:02,258
interface in dealing with Siri,

1798
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,660
not Siri's voice.

1799
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,694
We've used deep learning now to

1800
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,063
create a really natural and

1801
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:09,298
expressive voice for Siri and

1802

Now, Siri also has a male voice

00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:35,524

with followup questions and

So, you can now ask something

like, how do you say what are

1827

Now, translation initially will

1834
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,091
support translation from English

1835
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:11,060
to Chinese, French, German,

1836
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,862
Italian, and Spanish and we'll

1837
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,530
have more language combinations

1838
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,732
coming in the months to come.

to access your other

1841
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,604
applications, we have SiriKit.

1842

And SiriKit can now do more than

1843

ever in iOS 11.

1844
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:28,143

bring up a QR code in WeChat.

1850

Now, Siri isn't just a voice

1851
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:41,724
assistant, because with Siri

1852

Intelligence, Siri not only

1853
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,060
understands your voice, it

1854
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,096
understands the context.

1855
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,231
It understands your interest.

1856
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:50,399
It understands how you use your

device.

1858
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:53,135
And this allows it to ultimately

1859
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:55,871
understand what you want next.

1860
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:57,706
Now, we've all experienced this

1861
00:57:57,706 --> 00:57:59,308
where Siri can help us predict

1862
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:00,676
what apps we might want to use

1863
00:58:00,676 --> 00:58:03,078
next, give us a time to leave

1864
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:04,246
notification based on our

1865
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:06,916
calendar and where we are, help

1866
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,918
us respond to a text message.

1867
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:11,587
In iOS 11, Siri uses on-device

about topics of interest to us.

1870

too.

1899
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:09,778
And today, they do it in H.264.

1900
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:11,879
But now with our latest iPhones

1903
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,388
two times better compression for

1904
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,057
camera-captured videos, which

1905
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:23,892
means less storage space used on

1982
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:43,799
what you'll notice is Control

can adjust volume like this.

1996

on slider like this and get

access to more controls.

1998

bunch of video automatically

01:03:19,194 --> 01:03:20,796
the best shot wasn't the still.

2042
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:23,332
Well, now, we can go in to Edit

2043
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:24,799
Mode, we could trim this video

2044
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,535
if we want but we also can

2045
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:28,636
capture just the frame we want

2046
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:32,507
and make that our key photo.

But would it be greater-- great

2053
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:47,856
if she could just keep blowing

2054
01:03:47,856 --> 01:03:49,124
that bubble?

Well, now, she can.

01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:52,493
We actually use computer vision

2070
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:16,652
artistic things with live photos

2071
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:17,452
as well.

2072
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:18,654
So, you see, this is a shot

2073
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,523
where we have a still landscape

2074
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:22,658
but then there's movement in the

2075

water.

2076
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:24,893
Now, if you wanted to capture

2077
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:26,328
this kind of motion,

2078
01:04:26,328 --> 01:04:27,529
traditionally you'd have to get

2079
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,598
a tripod and figure out how to

2080
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:31,533
configure a long exposure on

2081

your high-end camera.

2082

But now, you can actually just

2083
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,505
go into the effects here and

2084
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,307

Because you see, memories can

2092
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,818
now capture things like

2093

know, these pets.

01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:16,812
using computer vision to

2107
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,346
actually identify photos of your

more about you and what you're

much more in learning how you're

using your device.

2136
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,875
surfaces for me a recommendation

01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,076
that I might be interested in

2138

2139
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,612
I could just tap in and heart

this one like this.

2141
01:06:24,479 --> 01:06:26,080
And if I tap into a particular

2142
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:28,283

2143

speaks Icelandic.

per month thereafter.

And we're also bringing the

2209
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,096
support to major airports.

2210
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:22,630
You can see where security is so

2211
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:24,466
you can plan.

Now, we'll be supporting all of

2214
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:31,740
these airports to start, and

2215
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,274

2217
01:08:34,075 --> 01:08:35,109
And, of course, we have more

2218
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:36,777
improvements to navigation.

2219
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:37,846
So now on the upper left, you

2220
01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:39,680
can even see your speed limit, I

2221
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,549
hope you're paying attention to

2222
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:43,752
that, and lane guidance so you

2223
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:45,253
know which lane to be in to make

2224
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,488
your next move when navigating.

[ Applause ]

2226
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,560
Now, we know in addition to

2227
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,727
navigation, people like to do

2228
01:08:52,727 --> 01:08:54,696
more with their phones sometimes

2229
01:08:54,696 --> 01:08:55,497
while driving.

2230
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:57,199
And our safest solution for

2231
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,267
doing this is CarPlay, lets you

2232
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:00,902
keep your eyes on the road while

2233
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:02,170
you're doing things like asking

2234
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,837
Siri to play music.

2235
01:09:03,837 --> 01:09:05,307
Well, we wanted to bring this

2236
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,841
same level of safety to everyone

2237
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:09,076
who maybe doesn't have one of

2238
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:11,513
the 200 models of cars that

2239
01:09:11,513 --> 01:09:12,913
currently support CarPlay.

2240
01:09:12,913 --> 01:09:14,983
And we're building on "Do Not

2241
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:16,585
Disturb" with a new feature we

2242
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,486
call "Do Not Disturb While

2243
01:09:18,486 --> 01:09:19,321
Driving".

2244
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,456
And it's all about keeping your

2245
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:22,324
eyes on the road.

2246
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:23,825
When you're driving, you don't

2247
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:25,961
need to be responding to these

2248
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,529
kinds of messages.

2249
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:28,563
In fact, you don't need to see

2250
01:09:28,563 --> 01:09:29,798
them.

2251
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:34,202
So now, when you install iOS 11,

2252
01:09:34,202 --> 01:09:35,537
we're going to use Bluetooth to

2253
01:09:35,537 --> 01:09:36,638
understand if you're connected

2254
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:37,404
to a car.

2255
01:09:37,404 --> 01:09:38,240
Or even if you don't have

2256
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,307
Bluetooth, we're going to use

2257
01:09:39,307 --> 01:09:41,643
WiFi Doppler effect to measure

2258
01:09:41,643 --> 01:09:43,111
that you're moving in a car.

2259
01:09:43,111 --> 01:09:44,246
And when you finish that first

2260
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,413

2261
01:09:45,412 --> 01:09:46,814
hey how about we activate "Do

2262

Not Disturb While Driving".

2263
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,018
And when we do, instead of

2264
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:52,020
seeing all those notifications,

2265
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,355
we have this new user interface

Now, if you're tempted and you

2269
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:06,201
try to turn on your phone,

2270
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:07,435
you're actually going to receive

2271
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:09,604
this, a little reminder that

2272
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:10,372
you're not receiving

driving.

2275
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:12,907
But, of course, you might be

2276
01:10:12,907 --> 01:10:14,276
sitting in the back seat in

2277
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,410
which case, you can tell us,

2278

"I'm not driving and you could

get through."

2281
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:20,248
someone sent you a message?

2283

automatic response saying, "I'll

2284
01:10:23,518 --> 01:10:24,452
see your message when I get

2285

where I'm going."

especially urgent.

01:10:30,091 --> 01:10:30,959
You can have the peace of mind

2290
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:32,494
that you can get contacted and

2291
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,795
they can reply urgent and that

message will go through.

2293
01:10:35,363 --> 01:10:36,264
We think this is going to be a

But, of course, a lot of the way

2368
01:12:54,869 --> 01:12:56,204
we discover music is to ask one

2369
01:12:56,204 --> 01:12:57,639
of our friends, "What have you

2370
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,274
been listening to lately?"

2371
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,209
So now, in Apple Music, you'll

2372
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:03,678

make the App Store a trusted and

Phased releases means, when you

2500

submit an app, you can choose if

2501
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:48,536
you want it to be phased over

2502
01:16:48,536 --> 01:16:49,937
time so it doesn't hit your

2503

2526

01:17:51,432 --> 01:17:53,267
place for customers to discover

2542
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:55,036
your apps every single day.

2543
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:58,473
There's another new tab, Games.

2544
01:17:58,473 --> 01:17:59,741
Games, the biggest area of the

2545
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:00,942
App Store has its own dedicated

2546
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:01,709
space now.

2547
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:03,077
So for all of us who loves

2548
01:18:03,077 --> 01:18:04,479
gaming and finding the best

2549
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,147
featured games of the day and

2550
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:07,782
seeing charts about gaming, this

2551
01:18:07,782 --> 01:18:09,350
is now a place to go to

2552
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:10,885
experience all that's happening

2553
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:11,686
with games.

2554
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:12,553
And not only can we feature

2555
01:18:12,553 --> 01:18:14,122
games, but for the first time in

2556
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,022
the App Store, we can feature

2557
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:17,024
in-app purchases as well.

2558
01:18:17,024 --> 01:18:18,860
A big part of your business is

2559
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,161
now there in the App Store so

2560
01:18:20,161 --> 01:18:21,529
the next time you have a brand

2561
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:22,830
new level, you have a brand new

2562
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,499
character, customers can see

2563
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,067
them right in the App Store and

2564
01:18:26,067 --> 01:18:27,201
click on them and start the

2565
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:29,437
process to get them right away.

2566
01:18:29,437 --> 01:18:31,072
And since Games have their own

2567
01:18:31,072 --> 01:18:32,907
tab, now Apps have their own

2568
01:18:32,907 --> 01:18:33,741
tab.

2569
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:35,076
This is everything that we love

2570
01:18:35,076 --> 01:18:36,677
about apps besides games with

2571
01:18:36,677 --> 01:18:38,612
dedicated features and charts

2572
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,214
all there for customers to

2573
01:18:40,214 --> 01:18:41,182
enjoy.

2574
01:18:41,182 --> 01:18:43,751
And every app and every game, of

2575
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:45,119
course, has its own product page

2576
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:45,987
in the store.

2577
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,054
These are more beautiful than

2578
01:18:47,054 --> 01:18:48,589
ever, more engaging with

2579
01:18:48,589 --> 01:18:50,024
incredible videos.

2580
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:51,058
You're going to love all the

2581
01:18:51,058 --> 01:18:52,660
features on your product pages

2582
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:54,061
and there're sessions here at

2583
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:55,663
WWDC to learn how to take

2584
01:18:55,663 --> 01:18:57,531
advantage of all those great new

2585
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,801
app page features.

2586
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,068
These are just some of the new

2587
01:19:01,068 --> 01:19:02,370
things in the all new App Store,

2588
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,372
the new Today tab, new Games

2589
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,807
tab, new Apps tab.

2590
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,541
And we'd love to show it to you

2591
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,443
live for the very first time.

2592
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:11,279
So please welcome Ann Thai,

2593
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,780
Product Marketing Manager for

2594
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,248
the App Store to the stage.

2595
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:15,449
Ann.

2596

[ Applause and Cheering ]

2597
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:20,388
>> Thanks Phil.

2598
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,889
I'm so excited to show you the

2599
01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:22,957
new App Store.

2600
01:19:22,957 --> 01:19:25,593
So let's get to it.

2601
01:19:25,593 --> 01:19:27,195
I'm going to open the store and

2602
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,330
I land right here on the Today

2603
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:31,699
tab, the new front of the App

2604
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:34,268
Store that updates every day.

2605
01:19:34,268 --> 01:19:36,070
The first thing I see is our top

2606
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:38,706
story, the world premiere of

2607
01:19:38,706 --> 01:19:40,608
Monument Valley 2 is finally

2608
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:42,476
here.

2609
01:19:42,476 --> 01:19:46,547
[ Applause and Cheering ]

2610
01:19:46,547 --> 01:19:48,049
Let's check it out by tapping on

2611
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:50,017
the card.

2612
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:51,652
This opens a story view where we

2613
01:19:51,652 --> 01:19:53,020
can learn more about the game

2614
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,488
and what makes it so great.

2615
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:56,157
It looks like this is going to

2616
01:19:56,157 --> 01:19:58,526
be even more beautiful than the

2617
01:19:58,526 --> 01:19:59,460
first.

2618
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,329
I can watch videos that show me

2619
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:02,429
what the game play is like.

2620
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:06,234
And here's a cool quote from Dan

2621
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,935
Gray at Ustwo Games about what

2622
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,338
inspired them.

2623
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,973
I can share the story with a

2624
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,041
friend and what's incredible is

2625
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,376
that we can actually all

2626
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:17,278
download this today, only on the

2627
01:20:17,278 --> 01:20:18,512
App Store.

[ Applause ]

2629
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:24,151
Let's see what else is happening

2630
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:25,052
today.

2631
01:20:25,052 --> 01:20:29,156
What have we got here?

2632
01:20:29,156 --> 01:20:31,525
Here's a how to guide about

2633
01:20:31,525 --> 01:20:32,326
VSCO.

2634
01:20:32,326 --> 01:20:33,060
I use this app all the time.

2635
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,229
Let's check it out.

2636
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:37,164
This is packed full of useful

2637
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:37,932
tips.

2638
01:20:37,932 --> 01:20:39,333
So even if you have an app

2639
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:40,800
already, you still might learn

2640
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:43,237
something new like I didn't know

2641
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:44,305
you could use it to make

2642
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:49,010
animated GIFs or GIFs.

2643
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,479
Anyway, you can make them.

2644
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,147
I just scroll back up and pull

2645
01:20:53,147 --> 01:20:54,949
down on the card and I'm back in

2646
01:20:54,949 --> 01:20:56,683
the feed.

2647
01:20:56,684 --> 01:20:58,085
Every day there's a new app of

2648
01:20:58,085 --> 01:21:00,554
the day and a new game of the

2649
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:03,758
day and the daily list.

2650
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:04,858
These are great because they're

2651
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:06,594
focused on a theme or a goal

2652
01:21:06,594 --> 01:21:08,729
like meditation.

2653
01:21:08,729 --> 01:21:10,197
I've actually been trying some

2654
01:21:10,197 --> 01:21:14,635
of these out to get ready for

2655
01:21:14,635 --> 01:21:16,103
this and it's totally working.

2656
01:21:16,103 --> 01:21:18,873
If I'm busy and miss a day, I

2657
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:21,474
can scroll down and see stories

2658
01:21:21,475 --> 01:21:23,077
from earlier in the week.

2659
01:21:23,077 --> 01:21:25,346
So that's the Today tab.

2660
01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:27,915
If I only want to see games, now

2661
01:21:27,915 --> 01:21:30,151
I can go to the New Games tab.

2662
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:31,218
This is huge.

2663
01:21:31,218 --> 01:21:32,219
Let's check it out.

2664
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:33,854
Up at the top I can see the

2665
01:21:33,854 --> 01:21:36,190
biggest new releases or just

2666
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,223
what the game editors are

2667
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:38,092
playing this week.

2668
01:21:38,092 --> 01:21:40,428
If I scroll down I can watch a

2669
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:42,330
whole bunch of game videos.

2670
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,099
And it's not just previews but

2671
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:47,368
also tips and gameplay videos by

2672
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:48,269
editors too.

2673
01:21:48,269 --> 01:21:50,571
If I scroll down, I can see

2674
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:53,207
charts that only feature games.

2675
01:21:53,207 --> 01:21:54,775
So it's really easy to see what

2676
01:21:54,775 --> 01:21:56,544
the most popular games are

2677
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:59,146
separate from apps.

2678
01:21:59,146 --> 01:22:00,748
And now I can browse by game

2679
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:03,217
categories too.

2680
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:04,852
This page is just packed full of

2681
01:22:04,852 --> 01:22:06,287
recommendations.

2682
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:07,788
This artsy game looks fun.

2683
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:08,621
Let's check it out.

2684
01:22:08,622 --> 01:22:10,691
I'm going to tap on the icon and

2685
01:22:10,691 --> 01:22:13,126
it opens up a redesigned app

2686
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:13,928
page.

2687
01:22:13,928 --> 01:22:15,463
It's more beautiful and more

2688
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:16,464
useful.

2689
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:17,999
I can watch more videos that

2690
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,532
show me how fun this is.

2691
01:22:19,533 --> 01:22:21,669
And this badge at the top tells

2692
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:23,604
me it was named editor's choice.

2693
01:22:23,604 --> 01:22:26,107
If I scroll down, I can see

2694
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,575
ratings and reviews front and

2695
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:29,210
center so I can see what other

2696
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,012
customers think before making a

2697
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:31,846
choice.

2698
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,048
Like this review, it tells me

2699
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:35,683
this game is great for killing

2700
01:22:35,683 --> 01:22:36,450
time.

2701
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,053
Thanks, FuriousPotatoFace.

2702
01:22:39,053 --> 01:22:42,256
For all the incredible apps on

2703
01:22:42,256 --> 01:22:44,125
the store there's a new tab too,

2704
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,059
the Apps tab.

2705
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:46,694
Let's go there.

2706
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:48,796
It shares the same great design

2707
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:50,364
as the Games tab but with a

2708
01:22:50,364 --> 01:22:51,898
focus just on apps.

2709
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:55,202
So that was just the first day

2710
01:22:55,202 --> 01:22:56,470
on the new App Store.

2711
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:58,372
Now you can see why we're so

2712
01:22:58,372 --> 01:23:00,041
excited to have a beautiful new

2713
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,176
place to share apps and games we

2714
01:23:02,176 --> 01:23:02,943
love with you.

2715
01:23:02,943 --> 01:23:05,479
Back to you, Phil.

2716
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:09,550
[ Applause ]

2717
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:11,519
>> Thank you, Ann.

2718
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,820
So that's your first glimpse of

2719
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,522
an entirely new App Store.

2720
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:15,456
We hope you love it.

2721
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:17,124
We hope customers love it and

2722
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:18,692
visit it every single day to

2723
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:21,462
download your incredible apps.

2724
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:22,930
And that's it for the App Store.

2725
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:24,298
Back to you, Craig.

2726
01:23:24,298 --> 01:23:26,567
[ Applause ]

2727
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:28,402
>> Thank you, Phil.

2728
01:23:28,402 --> 01:23:29,770
The App Store looks just

2729
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:30,905
fantastic.

2730
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:32,907
So those are some of the big

2731
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,209
features in iOS 11.

2732
01:23:35,209 --> 01:23:37,010
But of course, there's also core

2733
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:37,845
technologies.

2734
01:23:37,845 --> 01:23:39,780
Now, Metal 2 and HEVC coming to

2735
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:43,384
iOS as well, but there's more

2736
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:45,820
and it starts with machine

2737
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,920
learning.

2738
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:49,190
Now, you've seen the way we've

2739
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,624
used machine leaning throughout

2740
01:23:50,624 --> 01:23:53,027
the experiences on Apple Watch,

2741
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:54,395
for instance, and the predictive

2742
01:23:54,395 --> 01:23:56,564
Siri watch face.

2743
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,233
We use it on the iPad for palm

2744
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:00,201
rejection when you're writing

2745
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,068
with Apple Pencil.

2746
01:24:01,068 --> 01:24:04,672
Of course, we use it to extend

2747
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:06,005
your battery life by predicting

2748
01:24:06,006 --> 01:24:06,874
how you're going to use your

2749
01:24:06,874 --> 01:24:08,409
device.

2750
01:24:08,409 --> 01:24:09,844
And you've seen it throughout

2751
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,446
photos with memories and face

2752
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:13,747
recognition.

2753
01:24:13,747 --> 01:24:14,882
Well now, for all of you

2754
01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:16,217
developers, we want to make

2755
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,018
powerful machine learning easy

2756
01:24:18,018 --> 01:24:19,320
for you to incorporate in your

2757
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,154
apps.

2758
01:24:20,154 --> 01:24:21,822
And we're doing it via set of

2759
01:24:21,822 --> 01:24:23,157
new APIs.

2760
01:24:23,157 --> 01:24:24,725
Starts with the vision API which

2761
01:24:24,725 --> 01:24:26,460
provides face tracking, face

2762
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,895
detection, landmarks, all of

2763
01:24:27,895 --> 01:24:29,196
these core features we use

2764
01:24:29,196 --> 01:24:31,565
inside of our apps.

2765
01:24:31,565 --> 01:24:33,334
And the natural language API

2766
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,202
that provides capabilities like

2767
01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:36,837
tokenization and named entity

2768
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:38,005
recognition.

2769
01:24:38,005 --> 01:24:40,374
Now, these are all built on Core

2770
01:24:40,374 --> 01:24:41,142
ML.

2771
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:44,345
And Core ML provides high

2772
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,180
performance implementations of

2773
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,748
deep neural networks, recurrent

2774
01:24:47,748 --> 01:24:49,150
neural networks, convolution

2775
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,416
neural networks, support vector

2776
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:51,485
machines.

2777
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:52,652
And they allow you to take

2778
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:53,721
models that you've built with

2779
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,388
any of these popular third party

2780
01:24:55,389 --> 01:24:56,223
tools.

2781
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:57,725
And using our machine leaning

2782
01:24:57,725 --> 01:24:59,827
model converter, execute them

2783
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:01,996

2785
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:05,432
privacy benefits and all of the

2786
01:25:05,432 --> 01:25:06,834
carefully tuned compatibility

2787
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:08,702
with all of our platforms, and

2788
01:25:08,702 --> 01:25:10,437
the performance really is

2789
01:25:10,437 --> 01:25:11,438
incredible.

2790
01:25:11,438 --> 01:25:12,540
You look at this benchmark

2791
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,874
called Inception v3.

2792
01:25:13,874 --> 01:25:15,742
It's a popular photo recognition

2793
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:17,344
benchmark.

01:25:17,344 --> 01:25:20,214
iPhone is six times faster than

2795
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:23,250
Google Pixel and the Samsung S8

2796
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,485
using Core ML.

[ Applause ]

2798
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:32,125
Next, I'd like to turn to AR.

2799
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:35,262
Now, with Multi-Touch, it really

2800
01:25:35,262 --> 01:25:36,630
changed the way that you

2801
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:38,832
interact with the world on the

2802
01:25:38,832 --> 01:25:40,734
screen of your iPhone.

2803
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:42,336
And with the camera, it allowed

2804
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:44,471
you to capture the world around

2805
01:25:44,471 --> 01:25:45,306
you.

2806
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:46,406
But when you bring these things

2807
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,242
together, the results can

2808
01:25:48,242 --> 01:25:50,010
actually be quite profound.

2809
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:51,078
Now it's called the augmented

2810
01:25:51,078 --> 01:25:53,314
reality and we have a new core

2811
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,116
technology called ARKit to bring

2812
01:25:56,116 --> 01:25:57,218
it to all of you.

2813
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,686
And I'd like to show it to you

2814
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,454
in a demo now.

01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:09,597
carefully edited vision videos

2818
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:11,999
on this topic recently, but in

2819
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:13,601
this case I'd like to show you

2820
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:14,867
something for real.

2821
01:26:14,868 --> 01:26:16,770
So, what we see here is an

2822
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:19,073
iPhone that's-- look, using its

2823
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:21,609
camera but using computer vision

2824
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,310
it's actually able to identify

2825
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:26,046
surfaces such as this table and

2826
01:26:26,046 --> 01:26:27,681
I can actually just add an

2827
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:28,514
object.

2828
01:26:28,515 --> 01:26:30,050
This is a developer application,

2829
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,218
a test application that you'll

2830
01:26:31,218 --> 01:26:33,019
all be getting code for that

2831
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,955
allows you to do these things.

2832
01:26:34,955 --> 01:26:37,825
Now, this is a virtual object on

2833
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,793
this table.

2834
01:26:39,793 --> 01:26:40,494

off the cup.

2838
01:26:46,233 --> 01:26:47,468
Now I can add other objects to

2839
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,702
the scene and these things can

2840
01:26:48,702 --> 01:26:49,536
actually interact.

2841
01:26:49,536 --> 01:26:51,839
Let's add a lamp and I want you

2842
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:53,507
to watch when I turn the lamp up

2843
01:26:53,507 --> 01:26:55,509
on the dynamic shadows here.

2844
01:26:55,509 --> 01:26:57,478
I'm going to move the cup and

2845
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:59,480
watch how the shadow moves in

2846
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,215
relationship to the light here.

2847
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:04,318
It's really pretty incredible.

2848
01:27:04,318 --> 01:27:07,054
Now, I can add additional

2849
01:27:07,054 --> 01:27:07,888
objects.

2850
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:09,923
Let's add a vase to the scene.

2851
01:27:09,923 --> 01:27:10,657
I mean, isn't that just

2852
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:11,492
incredible?

2853

So it gives you a little bit of

2857
01:27:17,798 --> 01:27:19,867
an idea of the technology

2858

It's really pretty incredible.

2860
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:23,470
Now, how do we do it?

[ Applause ]

2862
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,175
Well, ARKit provides fast and

2863
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:29,877
stable motion tracking and it

2864
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,979
uses all of the sensors and the

2865
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:33,247
camera in your device to do

2866
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:34,081
this.

2867
01:27:34,081 --> 01:27:35,549
It actually finds planes like

2868
01:27:35,549 --> 01:27:36,917
floors and tables.

2869
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:38,952
It's able to estimate ambient

2870
01:27:38,952 --> 01:27:40,487
light which helps us with the

2871
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:41,822
rendering and also helps with

2872
01:27:41,822 --> 01:27:42,623
scale.

2873
01:27:42,623 --> 01:27:43,723
You notice that cup hit the

2874

2875
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,593
not the size of an elephant.

I'm so excited to talk to you

today about iPad Pro.

3073
01:34:21,154 --> 01:34:22,923
When we first introduced iPad

3074
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:25,025
Pro just 18 months ago, it

3075
01:34:25,025 --> 01:34:26,358
completely redefined what you

3076
01:34:26,359 --> 01:34:27,828
could do with your iPad.

3077
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:29,529
Along with your incredible apps,

3078
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:30,697
it allowed our users to do

3079
01:34:30,697 --> 01:34:32,733
really amazing things, from

3080
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:34,034
professional design and

3081
01:34:34,034 --> 01:34:36,135

We're really excited about what

3085
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,710
can be real in your world today

3086

with iPad Pro.

3087
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:46,913
Well, as you know, there's two

3088
01:34:46,913 --> 01:34:48,214
models to iPad Pro today.

3089
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:50,217
There's a 13-inch and a

3090
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:51,651
9.7-inch.

3091
01:34:51,651 --> 01:34:53,385
And the 9.7-inch is our most

3092
01:34:53,386 --> 01:34:54,788
popular model.

3093
01:34:54,788 --> 01:34:56,289
It has a screen large enough to

3094
01:34:56,289 --> 01:34:57,791
get your work done, but it's in

3095
01:34:57,791 --> 01:34:59,159
a thin and light enough package

3096
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:00,293

3110
01:35:26,686 --> 01:35:28,522
Now, why 10 and a half inch?

3111
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:29,656
Well, for one, it's a lot

larger.

3113

It's 20% larger than a 9.7-inch.

3114
01:35:33,026 --> 01:35:34,294
But we are able to reduce the

3115
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:35,962
borders by nearly 40% which

3116

And this extra brightness and

3152
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:47,534
the P3 wide color gamut means

3153

Now, typically, up until today,

3166
01:37:13,793 --> 01:37:15,462
mobile displays have refresh at

3167
01:37:15,462 --> 01:37:16,696
60 hertz, means they update the

3169

Well, on the new iPad Pro, we've

3170
01:37:22,402 --> 01:37:23,970
doubled that maximum refresh

3171

So what does that mean to you?

3174
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,748
It means that all of your motion

3175
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:35,848
content on your screen is going

3176
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:38,652
to be smoother, crisper, more

3178
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:41,154

to really touch and feel

3180

yourself to appreciate because

3181
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,058
our projection systems just

3182
01:37:45,058 --> 01:37:46,259
aren't capable of doing those

type of refresh rates.

3184

But I'll tell you the difference

3185
01:37:48,862 --> 01:37:49,696
is dramatic.

3186
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:51,431
And when you scroll, it's

3187
01:37:51,431 --> 01:37:53,433
buttery smooth.

3188
01:37:53,433 --> 01:37:54,734
Now, the higher refresh rate

3189
01:37:54,734 --> 01:37:56,436
also means it works even better

3190

with the Apple Pencil.

3191
01:37:57,671 --> 01:37:58,838
We already have the

3192
01:37:58,838 --> 01:38:00,273
industry-leading performance for

3193

3195
01:38:02,642 --> 01:38:05,144
ProMotion, it gets even better.

3196
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:06,446
It's more responsive and it

3197
01:38:06,446 --> 01:38:07,881
reduces our latency to an

3198
01:38:07,881 --> 01:38:11,451
industry best 20 milliseconds.

So drawing is incredibly fluid

3201
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:18,558
and even more natural, you're

3202
01:38:18,558 --> 01:38:20,427
going to love using the Apple

Pencil of the new iPad Pro.

3204
01:38:22,395 --> 01:38:23,396
Another breakthrough of

3205
01:38:23,396 --> 01:38:25,031
ProMotion is that these become

3206
01:38:25,031 --> 01:38:26,466
the first mobile displays to be

3207

able to dynamically adjust the

3208
01:38:28,201 --> 01:38:29,869
refresh rate, depending on what

3209

you're looking at.

3210

breakthrough for both display

3212
01:38:33,106 --> 01:38:35,375
quality, as well as for power

3213
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:36,309
savings.

3214
01:38:36,309 --> 01:38:37,644
So when you have dash-moving

3215
01:38:37,644 --> 01:38:38,778
content, they can update

3216
01:38:38,778 --> 01:38:40,013
quickly.

3217
01:38:40,013 --> 01:38:42,215
But they can also update slower

3218
01:38:42,215 --> 01:38:43,483
when you don't need that type of

3219
01:38:43,483 --> 01:38:44,317
refresh rate.

3220
01:38:44,317 --> 01:38:45,785
For example, a still image, this

3221
01:38:45,785 --> 01:38:46,853
allows us to save a lot of

3222
01:38:46,853 --> 01:38:47,887
energy and give you better

3223
01:38:47,887 --> 01:38:49,389
battery life.

3224
01:38:49,389 --> 01:38:50,590
So, hopefully you see why these

3225
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:52,158
are not just the best displays

3226
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:53,994
that we've ever made, but we

3227
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:54,995
think they're the most advanced

3228
01:38:54,995 --> 01:38:57,497
displays in the planet.

3229
01:38:57,497 --> 01:38:58,498
Next, let's talk about

3230
01:38:58,498 --> 01:39:00,200
performance.

3231
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,202
iPad is already best in class

3232
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:03,370
for performance.

3233
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,371
But we're not resting on our

3234
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:05,572
laurels.

3235
01:39:05,572 --> 01:39:07,340
These are the fastest we've ever

3236
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:08,408
created.

3237
01:39:08,408 --> 01:39:09,976
Inside them, they're powered by

3238
01:39:09,976 --> 01:39:12,679
the A10X Fusion chip.

3239
01:39:12,679 --> 01:39:15,482
The A10X has a six-core CPU,

3240
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:17,150
three high-performance cores,

3241
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:18,651
three high-efficiency cores, all

3242
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:20,353
automatically managed by the

3243
01:39:20,353 --> 01:39:22,756
Apple performance controller.

3244
01:39:22,756 --> 01:39:25,625
It also has a 12-core GPU.

3245
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:28,061
This is a powerhouse.

3246
01:39:28,061 --> 01:39:30,897
And it delivers 30% faster CPU

3247
01:39:30,897 --> 01:39:32,866
performance over our already

3248
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:35,602
industry leading A9X and 40%

3249
01:39:35,602 --> 01:39:38,471
faster graphics performance.

3250
01:39:38,471 --> 01:39:43,543
[ Applause ]

3251
01:39:43,543 --> 01:39:45,378
Our chip team has done just an

3252
01:39:45,378 --> 01:39:47,614
amazing job over the years with

3253
01:39:47,614 --> 01:39:48,781
the performance improvements and

3254
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:50,517
results have been staggering.

3255
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:51,284
They're delivering an

3256
01:39:51,284 --> 01:39:52,352
industry-leading graphics

3257
01:39:52,352 --> 01:39:54,554
performance that's more than 500

3258
01:39:54,554 --> 01:39:56,056
times the original iPad from

3259
01:39:56,056 --> 01:39:58,825
just a few years ago.

3260
01:39:58,825 --> 01:40:00,626
But of course, numbers only tell

3261
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:02,162
part of the story.

3262
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:03,363
To demonstrate the real-world

3263
01:40:03,363 --> 01:40:04,764
performance of the A10X in the

3264
01:40:04,764 --> 01:40:06,866
new iPad Pro, I'd like to invite

3265
01:40:06,866 --> 01:40:09,502
Ash Hewson of Serif to give you

3266
01:40:09,502 --> 01:40:10,937
a demo of their new Pro photo

3267
01:40:10,937 --> 01:40:12,472
editing app called Affinity

3268
01:40:12,472 --> 01:40:12,871
Photo.

3269
01:40:12,872 --> 01:40:14,007
Ash.

3270
01:40:14,007 --> 01:40:16,009
[ Applause ]

3271
01:40:16,009 --> 01:40:17,477
>> Thanks, Joz.

3272
01:40:18,912 --> 01:40:19,979
So I'm thrilled today to be able

3273
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:21,381
to show you the iPad version of

3274
01:40:21,381 --> 01:40:22,749
Affinity Photo.

3275
01:40:22,749 --> 01:40:24,117
This is a truly high-end

3276
01:40:24,117 --> 01:40:26,252
professional photo editing tool.

3277
01:40:26,252 --> 01:40:28,321
And on this latest iPad Pro, we

3278
01:40:28,321 --> 01:40:29,122
can achieve levels of

3279
01:40:29,122 --> 01:40:30,690
performance which is simply

3280
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,791
unattainable on any other

3281
01:40:32,792 --> 01:40:33,626
device.

3282
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:34,427
And I'm going to try and show

3283
01:40:34,427 --> 01:40:35,562
you that today by creating a

3284
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:36,329
movie poster.

3285
01:40:36,329 --> 01:40:37,163
I've already set up a few

3286
01:40:37,163 --> 01:40:37,964
layers.

3287
01:40:37,964 --> 01:40:38,798
I've kind of got this great

3288
01:40:38,798 --> 01:40:39,666
background of some stormy sky.

3289
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:41,668
I've got a turbulent sea and

3290
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:42,469
this ship.

3291
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:43,303
Now, the first thing you'll

3292
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:44,304
notice when you're using this is

3293
01:40:44,304 --> 01:40:45,505
as you're kind of moving layers

3294
01:40:45,505 --> 01:40:47,607
around, rotating them or even

3295
01:40:47,607 --> 01:40:49,776
just sort of panning and zooming

3296
01:40:49,776 --> 01:40:51,376
around your work, I'm seeing all

3297
01:40:51,377 --> 01:40:53,379
of these now at 120 frames a

3298
01:40:53,379 --> 01:40:54,180
second.

3299
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,048
So it just feels incredibly

3300
01:40:55,048 --> 01:40:55,815
smooth.

3301
01:40:55,815 --> 01:40:57,150
But when you come to edit

3302
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,552
layers, because of Metal, we can

3303
01:40:59,552 --> 01:41:00,687
achieve performance more than

3304
01:41:00,687 --> 01:41:04,124
four times than i7 quad core

3305
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:04,958
desktop PC.

3306
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,425
And I'll show you what that

3307
01:41:06,426 --> 01:41:07,260
means.

3308
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:08,728
On this sea, I'm going to apply

3309
01:41:08,728 --> 01:41:09,896
a 12 filter.

3310
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:11,598
And look, just with my finger, I

3311
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:13,199
can kind of push this sea

3312
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,366
around, or I can even just like

3313
01:41:14,367 --> 01:41:16,769
flick away right over the side

3314
01:41:16,769 --> 01:41:17,770
of the ship.

3315
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:19,539
It's a totally new way to kind

3316
01:41:19,539 --> 01:41:22,142
of interact with your designs.

3317
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:23,209
And actually, everything is this

3318
01:41:23,209 --> 01:41:24,043
fast.

3319
01:41:24,043 --> 01:41:25,445
So let's-- So I wanted to set

3320
01:41:25,445 --> 01:41:28,114
this ship on fire, for example.

3321
01:41:28,114 --> 01:41:29,449
I've got this fire up all here.

3322
01:41:29,449 --> 01:41:30,650
I can move this over the back of

3323
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:31,416
the ship.

3324
01:41:31,417 --> 01:41:32,252
But to make that look more

3325
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:33,887
realistic, I need to apply blend

3326
01:41:33,887 --> 01:41:34,687
mode.

3327
01:41:34,687 --> 01:41:35,788
Now normally, blend modes is

3328
01:41:35,788 --> 01:41:36,856
something that takes a lot of

3329
01:41:36,856 --> 01:41:37,557
trial and error.

3330
01:41:37,557 --> 01:41:38,825
But now, look at this.

3331
01:41:38,825 --> 01:41:40,559
So I can just scrub down here

3332
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,061
and I'll get an instant preview

3333
01:41:42,061 --> 01:41:42,962
of all the different blend

3334
01:41:42,962 --> 01:41:43,796
modes.

3335
01:41:43,796 --> 01:41:44,631
So it makes it really, really

3336
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:45,932
easy to select the right blend

3337
01:41:45,932 --> 01:41:47,267
modes that I want.

3338
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:49,335
Now of course, everything I've

3339
01:41:49,335 --> 01:41:50,570
done so far, I've done using

3340
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:51,404
touch.

3341
01:41:51,404 --> 01:41:52,672
But with iPad Pro, we have the

3342
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:54,273
best stylus that's ever been

3343
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,108
made.

3344
01:41:55,108 --> 01:41:56,276
And we can do some great stuff

3345
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:57,644
with Apple Pencil, too.

3346
01:41:57,644 --> 01:41:59,212
A really good example of that is

3347
01:41:59,212 --> 01:42:00,280
our lighting filter.

3348
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,415
So here, I'll choose lighting,

3349
01:42:02,415 --> 01:42:03,583
and make that a bit bigger.

3350
01:42:03,583 --> 01:42:04,918
And look, I can actually control

3351
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:06,786
now the angle and the tilt of

3352
01:42:06,786 --> 01:42:09,022
that light using Apple Pencil.

3353
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:10,557
There's no latency, whatsoever.

3354
01:42:10,557 --> 01:42:12,791
So it's a really immersive way

3355
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:13,626
to work.

3356
01:42:13,626 --> 01:42:15,895
Now, I said at the start, I was

3357
01:42:15,895 --> 01:42:17,463
creating a movie poster.

3358
01:42:17,463 --> 01:42:18,565
And in fact, what I'm actually

3359
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:19,898
doing is creating a pirate movie

3360
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:20,600
poster.

3361
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,935
So now, I need a pirate.

3362
01:42:21,935 --> 01:42:22,835
And I've got Captain Jack

3363
01:42:22,835 --> 01:42:23,670
Sparrow here.

3364
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:25,238
But at the moment, of course,

3365
01:42:25,238 --> 01:42:26,606
he's on the wrong background.

3366
01:42:26,606 --> 01:42:27,639
So what I need to do is cut him

3367
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,408
out.

3368
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:29,175
And I'm going to use some

3369
01:42:29,175 --> 01:42:29,976
selection tool to do that.

3370
01:42:29,976 --> 01:42:30,809
So, to start with, I'm just

3371
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,978
going to do-- and you can see

3372
01:42:31,978 --> 01:42:33,980
how quick it is to do a really

3373
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:35,915
quick selection with pencil to

3374
01:42:35,915 --> 01:42:37,450
sort of snap around the edges.

3375
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,483
But of course, with selections,

3376
01:42:38,484 --> 01:42:39,686
what often happens is you need

3377
01:42:39,686 --> 01:42:40,687
to do a much more accurate

3378
01:42:40,687 --> 01:42:41,721
selection around hair.

3379
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:42,655
And to do that, we're going to

3380
01:42:42,655 --> 01:42:44,290
do a selection refinement.

3381
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:45,225
This is something that takes a

3382
01:42:45,225 --> 01:42:47,260
huge amount of CPU power, but on

3383
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:48,895
this latest iPad, it's twice as

3384
01:42:48,895 --> 01:42:50,263
fast as ever before.

3385
01:42:50,263 --> 01:42:51,331
And you can see pretty much

3386
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:52,665
instantly, I'll get a selection

3387
01:42:52,665 --> 01:42:54,067
down to individual strands of

3388
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:55,535
hair.

[ Applause ]

3390
01:43:00,106 --> 01:43:01,507
And that's it, that's my poster

3391
01:43:01,507 --> 01:43:03,442
complete, a professional looking

3392
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:06,779
poster created on a device that

3393
01:43:06,779 --> 01:43:08,881
I can hold in my hands.

3394
01:43:08,881 --> 01:43:11,084
It's really incredible.

3395
01:43:11,084 --> 01:43:12,318
I really think that iPad Pro,

3396
01:43:12,318 --> 01:43:14,420
alongside Affinity Photo, is a

3397
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:16,122
truly game-changing experience

3398
01:43:16,122 --> 01:43:17,357
for professional photo editing.

3399
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:18,191
And the best thing of all is

3400
01:43:18,191 --> 01:43:19,626
that you can now experience it

3401
01:43:19,626 --> 01:43:21,527
now, because I'm delighted to

3402
01:43:21,527 --> 01:43:23,263
announce that Affinity Photo for

3403
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:24,731
iPad is available on the App

3404
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:25,932

3405
01:43:25,932 --> 01:43:28,501
Thank you.

3406
01:43:28,501 --> 01:43:31,971
[ Applause and Cheering ]

3407
01:43:31,971 --> 01:43:34,874
>> Wow. Thank you, Ash.

3408
01:43:34,874 --> 01:43:36,209
That's amazing performance,

3409
01:43:36,209 --> 01:43:37,443
again, especially for a device

3410
01:43:37,443 --> 01:43:39,045
that's so thin and light in a

3411
01:43:39,045 --> 01:43:40,213
simple one-pound package you

3412
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:41,380
could take with you everywhere

3413
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:42,649
you go.

3414
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:44,083
And what's also cool is despite

3415
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,817
all this performance to new,

3416
01:43:45,818 --> 01:43:48,087
iPad Pro still delivers the same

3417
01:43:48,087 --> 01:43:49,756
all day 10-hour battery life

3418
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,457
that our iPad users love.

3419
01:43:51,457 --> 01:43:54,761
Next, let's talk about cameras.

3420
01:43:54,761 --> 01:43:56,896
The new iPad Pro features the

3421
01:43:56,896 --> 01:43:58,398
latest camera system from our

3422
01:43:58,398 --> 01:43:59,098
iPhone 7.

3423
01:43:59,098 --> 01:44:00,600
That means the same high

3424
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:03,636
performance 12 megapixel sensor

3425
01:44:03,636 --> 01:44:04,570
with optical image

3426
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:05,405
stabilization.

3427
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:07,674
And it has the ability to even

3428
01:44:07,674 --> 01:44:09,542
capture and, of course, edit 4K

3429
01:44:09,542 --> 01:44:10,777
video on the go.

3430
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:11,978
They're absolutely fantastic

3431
01:44:11,978 --> 01:44:13,046
cameras.

3432
01:44:13,046 --> 01:44:14,147
The front-facing cameras from

3433
01:44:14,147 --> 01:44:15,615
the iPhone 7 as well got all

3434
01:44:15,615 --> 01:44:18,050
these great features, like wide

3435
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:20,119
color gamut capture, auto image

3436
01:44:20,119 --> 01:44:21,487
stabilization and the entire

3437
01:44:21,487 --> 01:44:22,722
display can light up to become

3438
01:44:22,722 --> 01:44:24,624
the world's brightest and

3439
01:44:24,624 --> 01:44:27,026
largest Retina flash.

3440
01:44:27,026 --> 01:44:28,594
We have great accessories as

3441
01:44:28,594 --> 01:44:29,962
well.

3442
01:44:29,962 --> 01:44:32,999
The iPad Pro supports USB 3,

3443
01:44:32,999 --> 01:44:33,866
which means that you're going to

3444
01:44:33,866 --> 01:44:35,902
get faster transfers with your

3445
01:44:35,902 --> 01:44:37,770
USB and SD camera adapters.

3446
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:40,340
And this also-- We also support

3447
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,108
fast charging, means any of our

3448
01:44:42,108 --> 01:44:44,711
USB-C charge adapters will now

3449
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:46,279
allow you to charge at half the

3450
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:47,180
time.

3451
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:50,116
And we have great new Smart

3452
01:44:50,116 --> 01:44:51,250
covers we have available in

3453
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:52,485
polyurethane and then we're

3454
01:44:52,485 --> 01:44:53,652
bringing back the popular

3455
01:44:53,653 --> 01:44:54,721
leather as well.

3456
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:56,321
And then we've designed an all

3457
01:44:56,322 --> 01:44:57,657
new leather sleeve with a

3458
01:44:57,657 --> 01:44:59,025
built-in storage for your Apple

Pencil.

3460
01:45:00,326 --> 01:45:01,561
So that's the new iPad Pro

3461
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:03,129
family, a line-up with the

3462
01:45:03,129 --> 01:45:04,764
world's most advanced displays

3463
01:45:04,764 --> 01:45:06,032
including a brand new 10 and a

3464
01:45:06,032 --> 01:45:07,567
half inch size and incredibly

3465
01:45:07,567 --> 01:45:09,702

3468

And of course as you would

3469
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:16,008
expect, we make all this in

3470
01:45:16,008 --> 01:45:17,343
incredibly environmentally

3471
01:45:17,343 --> 01:45:19,412
friendly ways.

3472
01:45:19,412 --> 01:45:21,347
We're also going to double the

3473
01:45:21,347 --> 01:45:23,616
amount of memory that comes at

3474
01:45:23,616 --> 01:45:24,417
the beginning of these

3475
01:45:24,417 --> 01:45:26,018
configurations.

3476
01:45:26,018 --> 01:45:28,588
Both sizes will now start with

3477
01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:31,491
64 gigabytes of memory.

3478
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:36,429
[ Applause ]

3479
01:45:36,429 --> 01:45:37,597
And the 10 and a half inch with

3480
01:45:37,597 --> 01:45:40,933
64 gigs will now be at $649 and

3481
01:45:40,933 --> 01:45:43,436
it's just $150 more to move up

3482
01:45:43,436 --> 01:45:48,074
to the bigger display at $799.

3483
01:45:48,074 --> 01:45:49,008
We're also going to have

3484
01:45:49,008 --> 01:45:52,044
configurations in 256 and 512

3485
01:45:52,044 --> 01:45:53,946
gigabytes, half a terabyte of

3486
01:45:53,946 --> 01:45:55,214
storage in an iPad.

3487
01:45:55,214 --> 01:45:56,983
And as always, you can get any

3488
01:45:56,983 --> 01:45:58,451
of these models with LTE as

3489

3490
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:02,455
So this is the new iPad Pro.

3491
01:46:02,455 --> 01:46:04,557
You can order them today.

3492

They'll start shipping next

3493
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,326
week.

3494
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:08,161
And of course because they're

3495
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:09,295
shipping now, they're going to

3496
01:46:09,295 --> 01:46:11,197
ship with iOS 10 but you'll be

3497
01:46:11,197 --> 01:46:12,732
able to easily update to iOS 11

3498

as a free update this fall.

3499

01:46:22,074 --> 01:46:23,142
to the stage to tell you about

3504
01:46:23,142 --> 01:46:25,711
some incredible iPad features

01:46:37,623 --> 01:46:39,892
well, buckle up for -- You're in

for a wild ride.

We are taking iOS to the next

3514
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:44,197
level.

3515
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:45,965
This is the largest iOS release

3516
01:46:45,965 --> 01:46:48,000
for iPad we've ever done.

3517
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,036
Now, it starts with the dock.

3518
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:51,404
Now we all know that dock

3519
01:46:51,404 --> 01:46:52,238
hovering down there at the

3520
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:53,739
bottom of the screen, it is more

3521
01:46:53,739 --> 01:46:54,773
powerful than ever.

3522
01:46:54,774 --> 01:46:56,976
You can fill it with apps.

3523
01:46:56,976 --> 01:46:58,177
On the right there's a

3524
01:46:58,177 --> 01:47:00,079
predictive area, figures out

3525
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:01,013
what you're going to use next

3526
01:47:01,013 --> 01:47:03,382
including your continuity apps.

3527
01:47:03,382 --> 01:47:05,050
And now you can summon the dock

3528
01:47:05,051 --> 01:47:06,419
from anywhere right from the

3529
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:08,387
bottom of the screen and use it

3530
01:47:08,387 --> 01:47:10,556
for switching apps just like

3531
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:11,357
that.

3532
01:47:11,357 --> 01:47:12,792
And what's incredible is how

3533
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:14,794
it's used for multitasking.

3534
01:47:14,794 --> 01:47:16,329
So now if you're in an app and

3535
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:18,097
you swipe up, we can pull an app

3536
01:47:18,097 --> 01:47:21,634
out just like that into Slide

Now of course you can snap your

3540
01:47:30,443 --> 01:47:32,578
apps into Split View, but what's

3541
01:47:32,578 --> 01:47:34,280
really cool is the new app

3542
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:36,215
switcher, because it preserves

3543
01:47:36,215 --> 01:47:38,618
all of your spaces with your app

3544
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:39,485

3545
01:47:39,485 --> 01:47:40,820
It's really great.

Now, the iPad of course is the

3547
01:47:42,221 --> 01:47:44,022
ultimate multi-handed,

3548
01:47:44,023 --> 01:47:46,058
multi-touch device and so we're

3549
01:47:46,058 --> 01:47:48,494
so excited to bring drag and

3550
01:47:48,494 --> 01:47:50,496
drop to iPad.

You can drag images, you can

3553
01:47:56,502 --> 01:47:58,538
drag text, you can drag URLs,

3554
01:47:58,538 --> 01:47:59,906
you can multi-select and

3555
01:47:59,906 --> 01:48:02,041
multi-hand drag, it's a drag

3556
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:02,875
fast.

3557
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:05,211
Now, it's incredibly productive.

3558
01:48:05,211 --> 01:48:06,512
But of course sometimes you have

3559
01:48:06,512 --> 01:48:07,580
to type and so we made the

3560
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:09,048
keyboard even more productive as

3561
01:48:09,048 --> 01:48:09,849
well.

3562
01:48:09,849 --> 01:48:11,651
You can now flick on keys to

3563
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:14,420
access punctuation and numbers

3564
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:16,055
all without switching planes.

Now, we have a new app to

3568
01:48:26,065 --> 01:48:28,934
introduce to you today, and it's

3569

Files brings together all your

files in your iPad.

3573
01:48:39,512 --> 01:48:40,580
It supports everything you'd

3574
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,014
expect, nested folders,

3575
01:48:42,014 --> 01:48:43,616
spring-loading, list view,

3576
01:48:43,616 --> 01:48:46,652
favorites, search, tags and it

3577
01:48:46,652 --> 01:48:48,487
has this beautiful Recents view

3578
01:48:48,487 --> 01:48:49,755
that pulls it all together

across all of your sources.

3580
01:48:51,157 --> 01:48:52,191
Because it supports not only

3581
01:48:52,191 --> 01:48:54,527
iCloud, it also supports third

3582
01:48:54,527 --> 01:48:55,928
party storage providers like

3583
01:48:55,928 --> 01:48:57,630

Google Drive.

01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,834
And they're all right here in

01:49:01,834 --> 01:49:04,103
your sidebar.

[ Applause ]

3590
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:12,277
Let's take our first look at iOS

3591
01:49:12,278 --> 01:49:15,381
11 on iPad.

3592
01:49:15,381 --> 01:49:17,984
So here we have our new dock at

3593
01:49:17,984 --> 01:49:18,818
the bottom.

3594
01:49:18,818 --> 01:49:20,519
Now I can easily drag right into

3595
01:49:20,519 --> 01:49:23,122
the dock just like this.

3596
01:49:23,122 --> 01:49:24,423
It's a great way to launch apps

3597
01:49:24,423 --> 01:49:25,523
as always.

3598
01:49:25,524 --> 01:49:27,460
But now it's also a great way to

3599
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:28,628
switch apps.

3600
01:49:28,628 --> 01:49:30,996
Just tap like that.

3601
01:49:30,997 --> 01:49:35,101
Now, if I want to multitask,

3602
01:49:35,101 --> 01:49:39,071
check this out, drag it out,

3603
01:49:39,071 --> 01:49:39,839
it's right there.

3604
01:49:39,839 --> 01:49:40,706
Now I can slide it off the

3605
01:49:40,706 --> 01:49:41,540
screen.

3606
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:43,943
I can now slide it over here.

3607
01:49:43,943 --> 01:49:45,211
Both these views are completely

3608
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:46,345
live.

3609
01:49:46,345 --> 01:49:47,813
I can go into Split View just

3610
01:49:47,813 --> 01:49:49,048
like this.

3611
01:49:49,048 --> 01:49:50,182
But I want you to check out the

3612
01:49:50,182 --> 01:49:51,250
new app switcher.

3613
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:52,485
I'm just going to swipe for up

3614
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:53,419
from the bottom and keep

3615
01:49:53,419 --> 01:49:56,122
swiping, goes back like that.

3616
01:49:56,122 --> 01:49:57,490
Let's do that again, that is so

3617
01:49:57,490 --> 01:49:59,090
great.

3618
01:49:59,091 --> 01:50:00,493

3621
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:08,000
preserved.

3622
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,801
So over here on the left I have

3623
01:50:08,801 --> 01:50:10,169
mail in Safari.

3624
01:50:10,169 --> 01:50:11,504
In Split View I can just tap

3625
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:13,205
those open like this.

3626
01:50:13,205 --> 01:50:14,373
Let's try some drag and drop.

3627
01:50:14,373 --> 01:50:15,641
So I'm going to drag the URL

3628
01:50:15,641 --> 01:50:16,842
from the top of Safari here

3629
01:50:16,842 --> 01:50:18,811
right into this mail message.

Drag it and drop it.

3631

Yup, just like that.

01:50:28,354 --> 01:50:30,289
Now, I want to focus just on

3635
01:50:30,289 --> 01:50:31,190
mail, because I'm going to show

3636

you dragging across spaces.

01:50:33,893 --> 01:50:35,394
So let's go in to Photos.

3638
01:50:35,394 --> 01:50:37,897
I have some great photos here of

3639

like that.

3646
01:50:48,574 --> 01:50:49,674

other hand in the multitasking,

3648

3651

I can bring up files of course

right from the dock and Split

01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:12,431
with attachments because I can

3656
01:51:12,431 --> 01:51:13,499
take this attachment and this

and take a closer look at the

3663
01:51:25,878 --> 01:51:27,112
Files app.

3664
01:51:27,113 --> 01:51:29,615
We see it has this gorgeous grid

3665
01:51:29,615 --> 01:51:31,550
view but it also has a list view

3666
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:33,152
that provides me all the details

3667
01:51:33,152 --> 01:51:34,386
about my files.

3668
01:51:34,386 --> 01:51:36,222
I can sort them by size or let's

3669
01:51:36,222 --> 01:51:37,490
sort by date.

3670
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:38,924
Now I can create new folders.

3671
01:51:38,924 --> 01:51:40,192
So let's say I want to create an

3672

R&D folder right here.

3673

secret perspective projects and

3675
01:51:46,398 --> 01:51:48,801
I can do multi-select just like

this, drop them in.

3677

Now I can also take the folder,

3678
01:51:52,972 --> 01:51:54,440
drag it right in to my

of my devices.

01:51:57,877 --> 01:52:00,079
And if I want to tag a file, of

3683
01:52:00,079 --> 01:52:01,413
course I just drag it right on

3684
01:52:01,413 --> 01:52:02,615
there and make that one

3685
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:03,516
important.

3686
01:52:03,516 --> 01:52:04,916
And you notice in addition to

access to all my cloud providers

into the Recents view from the

final act, I want to show you

how I can use files directly

3706

from the dock, just swipe up.

to my recent assets.

3709
01:52:40,152 --> 01:52:43,455
I can just pick this up, drop it

down just like that.

3714
01:52:52,398 --> 01:52:55,134
Now, next I want to talk about

3715
01:52:55,134 --> 01:52:56,669
Apple Pencil, because Apple

3716
01:52:56,669 --> 01:52:58,237
Pencil has really created a

3717
01:52:58,237 --> 01:53:00,072
whole new way of working on

3718
01:53:00,072 --> 01:53:00,773
iPad.

3719
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,241
And with iOS 11, we've

3720
01:53:02,241 --> 01:53:03,943
integrated it deeply into the

3721
01:53:03,943 --> 01:53:04,877
system.

3722
01:53:04,877 --> 01:53:06,078
Now it starts with markup,

3723
01:53:06,078 --> 01:53:07,780
because you can mark up anything

3724
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:09,114
you can Quick Look.

3725
01:53:09,114 --> 01:53:10,915
You can take Safari content,

3726
01:53:10,916 --> 01:53:12,418
recreate it into a continuous

3727
01:53:12,418 --> 01:53:14,385
scrolling view that you can mark

3728
01:53:14,386 --> 01:53:15,187
up.

3729
01:53:15,187 --> 01:53:15,955
And you can actually do this

3730
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:17,189
with any app that supports

3731
01:53:17,189 --> 01:53:18,224
printing, because we have a

3732
01:53:18,224 --> 01:53:20,192
create PDF option that will

3733
01:53:20,192 --> 01:53:21,961
create a markup PDF, it's a

3734
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,029
really great way to mark up

3735
01:53:24,029 --> 01:53:25,831
anything and share it.

3736
01:53:25,831 --> 01:53:26,899
We know, a lot of people do like

3737
01:53:26,899 --> 01:53:29,101
to share with screenshots, and

3738
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:30,035
so now when you take a

3739
01:53:30,035 --> 01:53:31,769
screenshot, we'll create a

3740
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:33,038
thumbnail down in the bottom of

3741
01:53:33,038 --> 01:53:33,873
the screen.

3742
01:53:33,873 --> 01:53:35,340
If you tap it, you go instantly

3743
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:37,509
in the markup, you can mark it

3744
01:53:37,509 --> 01:53:39,845
up right there and share it.

3745
01:53:39,845 --> 01:53:41,747
Now, we've all-- It's really

3746
01:53:41,747 --> 01:53:42,514
cool.

Now, we've also integrated

3749
01:53:47,353 --> 01:53:49,788
Pencil deeply into Notes.

3750
01:53:49,788 --> 01:53:51,089
So if you're working on a note

3751
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,224
and later you're at the lock

3752
01:53:52,224 --> 01:53:53,225
screen, you want to get back,

3753
01:53:53,225 --> 01:53:54,827
just a tap of the pencil to lock

3754
01:53:54,827 --> 01:53:56,629
screen and your right back into

3755

your note.

3756

And we've made your note

3757
01:53:58,964 --> 01:54:00,966
handwritten text searchable.

3758
01:54:00,966 --> 01:54:02,434
So we can now search handwriting

3759
01:54:02,434 --> 01:54:03,569
and we use deep learning to

3760
01:54:03,569 --> 01:54:05,838
recognize what you write.

3761
01:54:05,838 --> 01:54:07,973
And if you're doing primarily

3762
01:54:07,973 --> 01:54:09,975
typed notes, you can now also do

3763
01:54:09,975 --> 01:54:12,211
inline drawings, right there.

3764
01:54:12,211 --> 01:54:16,015

Now of course, sometimes we

3767
01:54:19,318 --> 01:54:20,819
still have to deal with paper,

3768
01:54:20,819 --> 01:54:22,621

contrast.

show you is a quick way of

You just tap on the lock screen

reveal your notes beneath it.

here as I edit the title.

index it in Spotlight.

3814

Let's switch into Spotlight now

3815
01:55:44,303 --> 01:55:45,971
and we'll search for that text

3816

different note now, because I

other great features.

3835
01:56:18,237 --> 01:56:19,438
This is a note that my young

3836
01:56:19,438 --> 01:56:20,773
daughter shared with me as part

3837
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:22,775
of a school assignment where she

3838
01:56:22,775 --> 01:56:24,043
had to work with her parents to

3839
01:56:24,043 --> 01:56:26,644
develop an idea for a new app.

3840
01:56:26,645 --> 01:56:27,846
Now, she asked me how many

3841
01:56:27,846 --> 01:56:29,313
copies of our app I thought I

3842
01:56:29,314 --> 01:56:31,350
might sell-- We might sell.

3843
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:32,951
And so, I want to quickly draw a

3844
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:35,020
graph to give her some idea of

3845
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:35,821
that.

3846
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:36,955
I'm just going to press down

3847
01:56:36,955 --> 01:56:38,090
here with the pencil to make

3848
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:40,559
some space for my drawing and

3849
01:56:40,559 --> 01:56:41,527
then we can take that little

3850
01:56:41,527 --> 01:56:43,429
grabber and open up some more

3851
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:44,263
room.

3852
01:56:44,263 --> 01:56:46,765
Now, I am really bad at drawing

3853
01:56:46,765 --> 01:56:48,767
but I just love doing it.

3854
01:56:48,767 --> 01:56:50,001
And what's great about drawing

3855
01:56:50,002 --> 01:56:51,937
on the iPad is it works the same

3856
01:56:51,937 --> 01:56:53,372
way as it does with paper.

3857
01:56:53,372 --> 01:56:55,374
And that means it's really easy

3858
01:56:55,374 --> 01:56:57,376
for me to draw really badly

3859
01:56:57,376 --> 01:56:58,644
right here.

3860
01:56:58,644 --> 01:57:01,880
Watch. I'm just going to put the

3861
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:05,484
pencil down and just like that,

3862

3863
01:57:06,418 --> 01:57:07,885
It's so simple, and I think

3864
01:57:07,886 --> 01:57:09,321
you're going to have a lot of

3865
01:57:09,321 --> 01:57:10,856
fun rediscovering the joy of

3866
01:57:10,856 --> 01:57:11,889
drawing.

3867
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:13,826
But let's move on now.

3868
01:57:13,826 --> 01:57:15,928
So, my daughter's learned a few

3869
01:57:15,928 --> 01:57:17,196
things from me about how Apple

3870

she gave me an NDA to sign.

here to bring up the document

3882

Notes will take the picture

the page up.

3885
01:57:41,787 --> 01:57:43,155
We'll open it up full screen

3886
01:57:43,155 --> 01:57:44,822
here and I just fill in the

3887
01:57:44,823 --> 01:57:47,126
blanks with my pencil.

3888
01:57:48,427 --> 01:57:50,529
And just like that, I've got a

3889
01:57:50,529 --> 01:57:52,898
signed copy of the NDA saved

away in my notes.

3891
01:57:54,733 --> 01:57:56,101
Now I see my daughter sent me a

3892
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:57,369
message and it must be pretty

3893

important if she's interrupting

3894
01:57:58,670 --> 01:57:59,505
my demo.

3895
01:57:59,505 --> 01:58:00,839
So if you'll excuse me, I'm just

3896
01:58:00,839 --> 01:58:01,874
going to tap on that and see

3897
01:58:01,874 --> 01:58:03,842
what she has to say.

3898

Wow, an offer for $100 million

is really pretty thrilling.

3900

I need to send this to my wife

right away.

3902
01:58:11,016 --> 01:58:12,584
I'm going to take a screenshot

of this and then we'll tap on

3904

3906
01:58:19,091 --> 01:58:21,126
From here, I can crop it down to

just the part of the image that

3908
01:58:22,861 --> 01:58:24,630
I want to send.

3909
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:26,798
I can scribble a quick note with

3910
01:58:26,798 --> 01:58:31,103
my pencil, and then I can bring

3911
01:58:31,103 --> 01:58:32,971
up the share sheet to send it

3912

off to my wife right away.

ways you can use your pencil

we're doing with iPad this year,

talk to you about.

music.

3968

Music has always been a part of

3969
02:01:38,957 --> 02:01:40,826
Apple's DNA.

3970
02:01:40,826 --> 02:01:43,395
We first revolutionized the

music industry with iTunes.

3972
02:01:46,798 --> 02:01:49,434
Then we forever changed the way

people listen to music on the go

3974

with the iPod.

3975
02:01:52,971 --> 02:01:55,406
And today, iPhone has become the

3976
02:01:55,407 --> 02:01:57,976
best portable music player in

3977

when it's paired with Apple

house, right?

4031
02:03:59,097 --> 02:04:00,699

distortion.

4035
02:04:07,038 --> 02:04:09,875
Second, it needs to be spatially

aware.

4037
02:04:11,076 --> 02:04:12,143
It's going to fit in different

4038
02:04:12,143 --> 02:04:13,144
rooms in our house and it needs

4039
02:04:13,144 --> 02:04:14,279
to be smart enough to know what

4040
02:04:14,279 --> 02:04:15,714
to do to make the music sound

to use.

4044

features.

4066
02:05:37,462 --> 02:05:39,631
First, rock the house.

4067
02:05:39,631 --> 02:05:41,499
The HomePod is just under 7

4068
02:05:41,499 --> 02:05:43,367
inches tall.

4069

It's covered in a seamless 3D

4070
02:05:45,437 --> 02:05:46,805
mesh fabric that has incredible

4071
02:05:46,805 --> 02:05:48,740
acoustic properties, and it

4072
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:51,175
hides within it amazing audio

4073
02:05:51,176 --> 02:05:53,011
technology.

4074
02:05:53,011 --> 02:05:56,781
For example, along the bottom is

4075
02:05:56,781 --> 02:06:00,185
a 7 array beam-formed tweeter

4076
02:06:00,185 --> 02:06:01,586
pack that's packed with seven

4077
02:06:01,586 --> 02:06:03,154
tweeters, each with their own

4078
02:06:03,154 --> 02:06:04,789
individual driver.

4079
02:06:04,789 --> 02:06:07,025
They're precision acoustic horns

4080
02:06:07,025 --> 02:06:09,059
that drive the audio from within

4081
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:10,895
and then out along the bottom

4082
02:06:10,895 --> 02:06:12,297
with tremendous directional

4083
02:06:12,297 --> 02:06:13,098
control.

4084
02:06:13,098 --> 02:06:14,165
And that will become really

4085
02:06:14,165 --> 02:06:15,533
clear in a bit as we talk about

4086
02:06:15,533 --> 02:06:17,268
how it works.

4087
02:06:17,268 --> 02:06:18,903
It has a really big woofer,

4088
02:06:18,903 --> 02:06:20,872
4-inch woofer upward facing with

4089
02:06:20,872 --> 02:06:22,240
a large motor to move a lot of

4090

equalization and dynamic

4093
02:06:25,377 --> 02:06:26,711
software modeling so that as we

4094
02:06:26,711 --> 02:06:28,513
turn the volume up, it's free

4095
02:06:28,513 --> 02:06:30,415
from distortion.

4096
02:06:30,415 --> 02:06:32,851
And all of this is controlled by

4097
02:06:32,851 --> 02:06:34,451
an Apple A8 chip.

4098

4101

It's perhaps the biggest brain

4102
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,529
ever in a speaker, and it does

4103

awareness.

4114
02:07:08,186 --> 02:07:09,019
Well, what does that mean?

4115
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:10,622
Well, you plug in your HomePod

4116
02:07:10,622 --> 02:07:11,990
to AC and it gets its music

4117

You can put it on a table, on a

within.

4126
02:07:24,703 --> 02:07:27,439
And it uses that information to

4127
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:29,240
adjust the audio, to balance it,

4128
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,809

but within it, HomePod detects

4150
02:08:19,591 --> 02:08:21,359
the center vocals and can use

music in Siri to be even greater

4216
02:10:48,406 --> 02:10:50,174
and understand more of the

4217
02:10:50,174 --> 02:10:51,342
questions we're going to ask

4218
02:10:51,342 --> 02:10:52,242
about music.

4219
02:10:52,243 --> 02:10:53,611
Simple things obviously like

4220
02:10:53,611 --> 02:10:55,280
Play Beats 1 Radio.

4221
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:56,447
We all want to do that.

4222
02:10:56,447 --> 02:10:58,283
Or play "I'm Poppy".

4223
02:10:58,283 --> 02:10:59,250
Check it out if you don't know

4224
02:10:59,250 --> 02:11:00,985
what that's about.

4225
02:11:00,985 --> 02:11:02,286
Play something new.

4226
02:11:02,287 --> 02:11:03,454
Who's singing on this track?

4227
02:11:03,454 --> 02:11:04,554
Something I ask all the time.

4228
02:11:04,555 --> 02:11:05,723
Who's playing drums on this

4229
02:11:05,723 --> 02:11:06,557
track?

4230
02:11:06,557 --> 02:11:07,825
To complex questions like, what

4231
02:11:07,825 --> 02:11:09,727
was the top song on May 5th,

4232
02:11:09,727 --> 02:11:11,429
2016.

4233
02:11:11,429 --> 02:11:13,331
You just play more like that or

4234
02:11:13,331 --> 02:11:15,233
I like that song.

4235
02:11:15,233 --> 02:11:16,401
It's a free form.

4236
02:11:16,401 --> 02:11:17,869
Siri doesn't need a specific

4237
02:11:17,869 --> 02:11:18,670
list of commands.

4238
02:11:18,670 --> 02:11:19,804
It can interpret what you're

4239
02:11:19,804 --> 02:11:21,739
saying and help you discover the

4240
02:11:21,739 --> 02:11:23,206
music you love.

4241
02:11:23,207 --> 02:11:24,575
And even better, you don't have

4242
02:11:24,575 --> 02:11:26,678
to just sit next to the HomePod

4243
02:11:26,678 --> 02:11:27,512
to talk to it.

4244
02:11:27,512 --> 02:11:29,447
It can be across the room and

4245
02:11:29,447 --> 02:11:31,049
speak to the HomePod even while

4246
02:11:31,049 --> 02:11:32,650
loud music is playing and the

4247
02:11:32,650 --> 02:11:33,483
speaker array and the

4248
02:11:33,484 --> 02:11:35,153
microphones can pick it up and

4249
02:11:35,153 --> 02:11:37,188
hear what you're saying.

4250
02:11:37,188 --> 02:11:39,824
So HomePod, it has the power to

4251
02:11:39,824 --> 02:11:42,125
rock the house in a spatial

4252
02:11:42,126 --> 02:11:43,494
awareness so that it understands

4253
02:11:43,494 --> 02:11:45,330
the rooms we place it within.

4254
02:11:45,330 --> 02:11:47,765
And it has the fun interactivity

4255
02:11:47,765 --> 02:11:49,867
of Siri becoming a musicologist

4256
02:11:49,867 --> 02:11:51,202
and helping us to listen to the

4257
02:11:51,202 --> 02:11:52,036
music we love.

4258
02:11:52,036 --> 02:11:53,871
And since Siri is built in there

4259
02:11:53,871 --> 02:11:55,373
and you can speak to it, well,

4260
02:11:55,373 --> 02:11:56,574
the team has also worked hard to

4261
02:11:56,574 --> 02:11:58,509
make it a great and helpful home

4262
02:11:58,509 --> 02:11:59,978
assistant as well.

4263
02:11:59,978 --> 02:12:03,281
We said the domain of music is

4264
02:12:03,281 --> 02:12:04,615
something Siri knows really well

4265
02:12:04,615 --> 02:12:05,450
in HomePod.

4266
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:07,218
There are other domains as well.

4267
02:12:07,218 --> 02:12:08,353
We've worked hard to pick the

4268
02:12:08,353 --> 02:12:09,687
first ones that we think matter

4269
02:12:09,687 --> 02:12:11,322
most in a product like HomePod,

4270
02:12:11,322 --> 02:12:12,623
so of course, it can play your

4271
02:12:12,623 --> 02:12:13,458
podcasts.

4272
02:12:13,458 --> 02:12:15,727
But it can also do things like

4273
02:12:15,727 --> 02:12:17,595
give you news, give you weather,

4274
02:12:17,595 --> 02:12:18,863
traffic, sports.

4275
02:12:18,863 --> 02:12:20,198
You can ask it to set a

4276
02:12:20,198 --> 02:12:23,267
reminder, set a timer, text

4277
02:12:23,267 --> 02:12:24,869
someone with messages.

4278
02:12:24,869 --> 02:12:26,437
And if you have HomeKit devices

4279
02:12:26,437 --> 02:12:27,438
set up in your home, you can

4280
02:12:27,438 --> 02:12:28,773
speak to your HomePod and

4281
02:12:28,773 --> 02:12:31,175
control your HomeKit devices.

4282
02:12:31,175 --> 02:12:34,712
So for example, for the HomePod

4283
02:12:34,712 --> 02:12:36,647
set up, you can say, "When do

4284
02:12:36,647 --> 02:12:38,049
the Red Sox play next?"

4285
02:12:38,049 --> 02:12:39,083
They're going to beat the

4286
02:12:39,083 --> 02:12:40,684
Yankees, trust me.

4287
02:12:40,685 --> 02:12:43,855
Tune to NPR instead, flip a

4288
02:12:43,855 --> 02:12:45,589
coin, remind me to bring snacks

4289
02:12:45,590 --> 02:12:46,824
to a party.

4290
02:12:46,824 --> 02:12:49,126
You can set up reminders, check

4291
02:12:49,127 --> 02:12:51,029
all the sports news and weather,

4292
02:12:51,029 --> 02:12:52,663
all directly with your voice,

4293
02:12:52,663 --> 02:12:53,865
talk to a HomePod that gets the

4294
02:12:53,865 --> 02:12:55,500
information directly from the

4295
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:56,334
cloud.

4296
02:12:56,334 --> 02:12:58,202
And if you have HomeKit devices

4297
02:12:58,202 --> 02:12:59,837
set up, you can say simple

4298
02:12:59,837 --> 02:13:01,839
things like, are the lights on,

4299
02:13:01,839 --> 02:13:03,741
turn the heat up, turn on the

4300
02:13:03,741 --> 02:13:05,343
air conditioning, bring the

4301
02:13:05,343 --> 02:13:07,979
shades down halfway, turn off

4302
02:13:07,979 --> 02:13:10,048
the lights in the bedroom.

4303
02:13:10,048 --> 02:13:11,416
And if you've set up scenes in

4304
02:13:11,416 --> 02:13:12,717
HomeKit you can control those as

4305
02:13:12,717 --> 02:13:13,418
well.

4306
02:13:13,418 --> 02:13:15,119
You can say, "I'm home.

4307
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:16,019
It's movie time.

4308
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:17,422
I'm leaving now."

4309
02:13:17,422 --> 02:13:18,656
And the whole scene can

4310
02:13:18,656 --> 02:13:20,958
automatically happen just by

4311
02:13:20,958 --> 02:13:23,094
talking to your HomePod.

4312
02:13:23,094 --> 02:13:26,330
And because there is a HomePod

4313
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:27,732
base-- the HomeKit base built

4314
02:13:27,732 --> 02:13:29,434
into HomePod, that means

4315
02:13:29,434 --> 02:13:30,868
anywhere in the world, once you

4316
02:13:30,868 --> 02:13:32,270
set up your first HomePod, you

4317
02:13:32,270 --> 02:13:34,105
control your HomeKit devices

4318
02:13:34,105 --> 02:13:35,906
remotely using the built-in Home

4319
02:13:35,907 --> 02:13:38,042
app on your iPhone or iPad.

4320
02:13:38,042 --> 02:13:41,245
Now, setting up a HomePod and

4321
02:13:41,245 --> 02:13:42,880
its microphone array in your

4322
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:44,015
home, you probably have a

4323
02:13:44,015 --> 02:13:45,316
question that we've worked

4324
02:13:45,316 --> 02:13:46,751
really hard to deal with, which

4325
02:13:46,751 --> 02:13:48,052
is privacy.

4326
02:13:48,052 --> 02:13:49,920
Our team cares deeply about your

4327
02:13:49,921 --> 02:13:51,122
privacy.

4328
02:13:51,122 --> 02:13:52,990
So for example, it has that

4329
02:13:52,990 --> 02:13:54,659
magic phrase, hey Siri.

4330
02:13:54,659 --> 02:13:56,794
Until you say it, nothing is

4331
02:13:56,794 --> 02:13:58,863
being sent to Apple.

4332
02:13:58,863 --> 02:14:00,698
It recognizes when you do say it

4333
02:14:00,698 --> 02:14:02,033
and from that point it sends an

4334
02:14:02,033 --> 02:14:04,302
anonymous Siri ID in order to

4335
02:14:04,302 --> 02:14:05,436
help you with the command you're

4336
02:14:05,436 --> 02:14:06,269
looking for.

4337
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:08,206
And of course that communication

4338
02:14:08,206 --> 02:14:09,874
is all encrypted.

4339
02:14:09,874 --> 02:14:12,809
So this is the HomePod.

4340
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:14,078
It's a breakthrough home

4341
02:14:14,078 --> 02:14:16,214
speaker.

4342
02:14:16,214 --> 02:14:18,149
Typically Wi-Fi speakers, if

4343
02:14:18,149 --> 02:14:20,718
they're a good quality, of $300

4344
02:14:20,718 --> 02:14:22,920
to $500.

4345
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,288
And a smart speaker might cost

4346
02:14:24,288 --> 02:14:27,090
you $100 to $200.

4347
02:14:27,091 --> 02:14:28,226
So it's not unreasonable for a

4348
02:14:28,226 --> 02:14:29,360
HomePod to be priced in the

4349
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:33,063
range of $400 to $700.

4350
02:14:33,064 --> 02:14:34,632
So we're really excited to tell

4351
02:14:34,632 --> 02:14:36,534
you that HomePod is going to be

4352
02:14:36,534 --> 02:14:39,504
priced for $349.

02:15:46,237 --> 02:15:48,139
refinements in technology that

4383
02:15:48,139 --> 02:15:51,209
will push the macOS experience

4384
02:15:51,209 --> 02:15:52,242
forward.

4385
02:15:52,243 --> 02:15:56,047
Updates to MacBook, MacBook Pro

4386
02:15:56,047 --> 02:15:58,148

4387
02:15:58,149 --> 02:16:00,751
capable than ever before.

4388
02:16:00,751 --> 02:16:05,656
And iOS 11, a major update of

4389
02:16:05,656 --> 02:16:07,458
the world's best and most

4390
02:16:07,458 --> 02:16:08,893
advanced mobile operating

4391
02:16:08,893 --> 02:16:10,995
system, absolutely jam-packed

4392
02:16:10,995 --> 02:16:12,897
with new features including a

4393
02:16:12,897 --> 02:16:17,101
completely new App Store,

4394
02:16:17,101 --> 02:16:19,036
peer-to-peer payments in Apple

4395
02:16:19,036 --> 02:16:19,870
Pay.

4396
02:16:19,870 --> 02:16:23,574
And with ARKit, iOS 11 becomes

4397
02:16:23,574 --> 02:16:25,675
the world's largest augmented

4398
02:16:25,676 --> 02:16:28,412
reality platform overnight.

4399
02:16:28,412 --> 02:16:31,315

4400
02:16:31,315 --> 02:16:33,583

4401
02:16:33,584 --> 02:16:35,553
features in iOS 11.

4402
02:16:35,553 --> 02:16:37,855
It's the biggest release for

4403
02:16:37,855 --> 02:16:40,124
iPad ever.

4404

And of course a new line up of

4405
02:16:41,726 --> 02:16:45,630
iPad Pro with an all new perfect

4406
02:16:45,629 --> 02:16:49,032
10.5-inch size with advanced

4407
02:16:49,032 --> 02:16:52,570
displays, powerful new features

4408
02:16:52,570 --> 02:16:54,237
that enable people to do more

4409
02:16:54,237 --> 02:16:55,473
with their iPads than ever

4410
02:16:55,473 --> 02:16:56,773
before.

4411
02:16:56,773 --> 02:17:00,010
And we gave you two sneak peaks,

4412
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:02,146

4413

4414
02:17:04,048 --> 02:17:06,317

4415
02:17:06,316 --> 02:17:08,385
our Pro users.

4416
02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:11,289
And the HomePod, a breakthrough

4417
02:17:11,289 --> 02:17:14,425
home speaker with amazing sound

4418
02:17:14,424 --> 02:17:17,227
and incredible intelligence.

4419
02:17:17,227 --> 02:17:19,296
It will reinvent home audio.

4420
02:17:19,297 --> 02:17:24,402
Now, we have a hands-on area for

4421
02:17:24,402 --> 02:17:26,971

4422

And someone will be joining us

4436
02:17:56,666 --> 02:18:00,103
that's devoted her entire career

4437

to highlighting and encouraging

4438
02:18:02,505 --> 02:18:06,143
young people, women and doers.

4439
02:18:06,143 --> 02:18:09,280

4440
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:12,316

4448
02:18:31,201 --> 02:18:32,169
world.

4449
02:18:32,169 --> 02:18:34,205
This is a very special treat and
