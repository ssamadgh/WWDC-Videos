[ Applause ]


3
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:26,516
>> Good morning and welcome to


4
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:28,446
Getting Ready for Business Chat,


5
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,836
I'm Dan and very shortly my


6
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:32,186
esteemed colleague Scottie will


7
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,336
be joining me on stage.


8
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:38,486
Last year at WWDC2017 Grant and


9
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:39,966
Scottie announced Business Chat


10
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:42,156
Developer Preview as a great new


11
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:44,216
feature of our Messages app, our


12
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:46,866
most popular app for Apple users


13
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,756
to securely and richly be able


14
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:51,256
to message with brands, consumer


15
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:53,036
brands, all around the world for


16
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,726
customer service and commerce.


17
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,606
We also launched our Apple


18
00:00:57,606 --> 00:00:59,346
Business Register at


19
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:00,346
registered.apple.


20
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:04,186
com/business-chat as the


21
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:05,556
fundamental way for businesses


22
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:07,396
and customer service platform


23
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:08,826
providers, which I'm going to


24
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:12,126
call CSPs from now on to easily


25
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:13,386
submit their application of


26
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:14,936
interest for access to a


27
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,806
Business Chat account.


28
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:20,286
Since then we've had a ton of


29
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,306
interest with thousands of


30
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:23,766
businesses and developers


31
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,376
submitting applications for


32
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:25,956
Business Chat.


33
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:28,036
Thank you very much for the


34
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:30,166
overwhelming fantastic response


35
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:32,066
and thank you for your patience.


36
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,936
After a few months of working


37
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,366
closely with some major brands


38
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:39,826
and their CSP providers we


39
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:41,676
announced the public release of


40
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,446
Business Chat Beta in March.


41
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:47,236
Now when we announced this we


42
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:48,906
also announced that in order to


43
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:50,536
use Business Chat users had to


44
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:52,826
upgrade to these versions of


45
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:56,036
iOS, macOS and watchOS or later


46
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:57,906
in order to message with brands


47
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:58,796
using Business Chat.


48
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:02,776
And experienced some really rich


49
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:05,776
message conversation with great


50
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:08,036
showcase brands in the retail


51
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,886
sector, in finance, in


52
00:02:10,886 --> 00:02:13,426
hospitality, and mobile services


53
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,206
supported by their CSP providers


54
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:19,056
like LivePerson, Salesforce,


55
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,106
Nuance, and InTheChat.


56
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,246
Hopefully you've had a chance to


57
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:26,426
actually experiment and play


58
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,716
with and, in fact, use some of


59
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,306
these great experiences with


60
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:31,026
these brands.


61
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,346
But in case you haven't just as


62
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,276
a quick reminder let me show you


63
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:36,086
an example where I can easily


64
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:37,146
start a conversation with


65
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:38,956
T-Mobile by swiping on the home


66
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:42,056
screen for iOS search, typing in


67
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:44,576
T-Mobile and then looking at the


68
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:45,976
search results, finding this


69
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,496
specific business preview,


70
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:48,856
tapping on the message button,


71
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:50,266
and immediately going into a


72
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,596
conversation with T-Mobile.


73
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:53,646
And in this example the T-Mobile


74
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,856
automated response clarifies


75
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,136
whether I'm a current customer


76
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,916
or not with a list picker, so I


77
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,326
tap on that, I get a choice, I


78
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:02,786
select Heck yeah.


79
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,696
And then now the automated


80
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:06,566
response wants to get me to


81
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,156
actually log in so we can get


82
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:09,396
into a lot of personal details


83
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:10,196
about my account.


84
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:12,436
I tap on the rich bubble, it


85
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:13,876
opens an iMessage app for


86
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:15,196
authentication, I enter my


87
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,936
credentials and I'm in.


88
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,486
All easily done within the


89
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:19,576
message conversation.


90
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,586
And so now I can continue to


91
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:22,596
have a very detailed


92
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:24,176
conversation about my account


93
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:26,006
and by the way, if I get really


94
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,846
busy and I have to leave to go


95
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,356
do something else when I get


96
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:30,706
back home or back to the office


97
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:32,226
I can pick right back up where I


98
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:35,116
left off on my Mac with the


99
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:35,806
Messages app.


100
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,586
Or if I'm busy and I'm on the go


101
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,136
I can receive and send Business


102
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,866
Chat messages from my Apple


103
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:42,356
watch.


104
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,086
Okay so that brings us to today


105
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:47,556
and I'm really excited to


106
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:48,956
announce that we're going to


107
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,486
open the doors significantly


108
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:52,426
wider to many more consumer


109
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:54,496
brands around the world and more


110
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,786
customer service platform


111
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:56,496
providers.


112
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:02,276
Very excited yes, thank you.


113
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:03,916
So let's look at some key steps


114
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:05,186
that I think are important that


115
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:06,766
we've learned that we want to


116
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,426
relay back to you about how to


117
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:10,536
get ready whether you're a CSP,


118
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:11,986
whether you're a consumer brand


119
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:12,916
or whether you're a brand


120
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,466
developer.


121
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,856
Starting with CSP providers.


122
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:20,206
There are two qualifying


123
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,446
criteria that we look at closely


124
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,696
when thinking about the


125
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,066
potential for a new CSP provider


126
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,266
for Business Chat and I'm going


127
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,396
to talk about those in a sec.


128
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,426
We also then once approved spend


129
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:34,936
and invest time with CSP


130
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:36,796
providers to help them get ready


131
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,806
to provide a great business chat


132
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,756
user experience and to get off


133
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,406
to a very fast start and we'll


134
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:43,436
talk about those quickly.


135
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:46,306
Starting with servicing medium


136
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:47,746
to large consumer brands.


137
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,226
For now, we're going to be very


138
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:50,946
focused on medium to large


139
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:51,936
consumer brands.


140
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:55,196
So as a qualified CSP you have


141
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:57,136
this base of customers and


142
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:58,346
you're providing them with a


143
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,496
platform solution that provides


144
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:02,036
contact management for these


145
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:03,406
brands, especially for


146
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:03,936
messaging.


147
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:08,616
And as a qualified CSP you have


148
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,516
these consumer brand customers


149
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,086
around the world in various


150
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:13,276
regions, whether it's North or


151
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,946
South America, whether it's


152
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,466
Europe, whether it's Japan,


153
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,336
Southeast Asia, Australia, New


154
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,426
Zealand or globally, but you do


155
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:21,946
have a base of these consumer


156
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:23,856
brands, medium to large consumer


157
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,686
brands around the world in one


158
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:26,566
or more regions.


159
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,696
And as a qualified CSP you


160
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:31,426
provide a fully featured


161
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:33,056
platform, so what do we mean by


162
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,366
that?


163
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:35,356
Well let's look at some major


164
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:37,116
features that we look for in


165
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:38,156
perspective CSPs that are going


166
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:40,866
to provide a great experience


167
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:41,946
for their customers with


168
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:42,566
Business Chat.


169
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:45,046
So starting with let's look at


170
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,896
this first example of an agent


171
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:49,266
console from LivePerson.


172
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,056
The LivePerson live engage


173
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:54,546
console has the opportunity


174
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:55,836
because of its built-in


175
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,146
capabilities for what we call


176
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:58,226
dynamic widgets.


177
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,966
And so a dynamic widget provides


178
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,906
the agent the capability to


179
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,846
populate with the right content


180
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,466
both image and text based on how


181
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,286
Business Chat operates based on


182
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,416
our API and built-in


183
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,466
functionality so that the agent


184
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,716
can simply tap on that to send


185
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:17,026
the payload down to me on my


186
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,356
iPhone when I'm communicating


187
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:20,046
with the Lowe's agent so that I


188
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,616
can make a simple selection


189
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,096
because I'm looking for smart


190
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:25,206
locks that support HomeKit.


191
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:28,186
Very easy to do, but the console


192
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,766
functionality is very important


193
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:30,836
to have this built in.


194
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:32,766
So then I'm ready to make a


195
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:36,346
purchase and I see oh, not my


196
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:38,526
HomeKit smart locks I see red


197
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:39,796
heeled shoes, thanks Scottie.


198
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,386
So now I guess I'm going to be


199
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:42,966
buying red heeled shoes.


200
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:44,816
So but in this case the same


201
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,446
thing an intelligent dynamic


202
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,056
widget that populates for the


203
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:50,386
agent the Apple Pay payload that


204
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:52,616
they can easily tap on again to


205
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,666
send the payload to me so that


206
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,596
all I have to do now is tap to


207
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:58,666
authenticate using Touch ID or


208
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,386
Face ID.


209
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,226
A very efficient, very powerful


210
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:02,636
way to implement Business Chat.


211
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:04,886
So let's talk about backend


212
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:07,186
systems, so backend systems


213
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,726
integration is also very


214
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:09,206
important.


215
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,286
Your platform must have APIs


216
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,486
that support your customers'


217
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:15,886
backend systems such as CRM,


218
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,846
scheduling, product inventory,


219
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,856
inventory ordering, order entry,


220
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:22,046
payment systems.


221
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,416
And in this example, it's a


222
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,016
Salesforce lightning service


223
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:26,686
console where because of a


224
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,236
previous conversation they had


225
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:30,666
my stable identifier, but


226
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,096
they've now -- I've identified


227
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,436
myself and they've now connected


228
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:34,496
me to a profile.


229
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:36,276
So now when I come back, the


230
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:38,956
agent CRM profile comes up and


231
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,136
they know about me so I can


232
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,116
start a very natural


233
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:42,676
conversation right off the bat.


234
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:45,016
And the agent has the ability to


235
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:47,066
pull from their engagement case


236
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,966
history all the previous


237
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,796
engagements I've had to again be


238
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:52,276
able to pull back some history


239
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,226
and go into a very fluid, easy


240
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:56,006
conversation with me-- super


241
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,246
important to have this backend


242
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:58,746
systems integration capability.


243
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,696
The next key point, intelligent


244
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:01,456
message routing.


245
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,616
So as you probably may recall


246
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,806
from last year, we announced


247
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:06,886
intent and group IDs as part of


248
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,556
the infrastructure support for


249
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:09,816
message payloads that are being


250
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,486
sent from me through the


251
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:13,276
business chat API to the


252
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,306
customer service platform


253
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:14,746
provider.


254
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,806
In this case, I may be searching


255
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,316
in the Maps app for a specific


256
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,346
location for Home Depot in Santa


257
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:21,706
Clara and I start the


258
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,576
conversation here by tapping on


259
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,566
the Message button.


260
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:28,646
And it sends and appends in the


261
00:08:28,646 --> 00:08:30,376
intent and group ID the actual


262
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,285
address that I've started at.


263
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,765
And so this is important because


264
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,006
the intelligent routing of your


265
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:37,666
platform may need to be able to


266
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,966
based on your business rules


267
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,506
route this to the right agent


268
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,056
group perhaps on the West Coast


269
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,405
because of hours of operation.


270
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:45,356
But it also supports the agent's


271
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:46,896
ability to then know where I


272
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,626
started my journey and be able


273
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:49,826
to help me right away knowing


274
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,036
I'm probably interested about


275
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:52,516
that specific store location.


276
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,336
Okay lastly, quality of service


277
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:58,116
monitoring, QOS, very important


278
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:59,326
and so in this example with the


279
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:00,656
Nuance dashboard.


280
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:02,636
Your platform needs to be able


281
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:04,576
to monitor, analyze and provide


282
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:07,456
statistics, KPIs, important KPIs


283
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,786
for your business customers.


284
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:10,856
And so being able to monitor


285
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:12,476
Business Chat conversations by


286
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,386
agent and provide important


287
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,516
statistics and KPIs, like the


288
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,916
average response time for


289
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,816
Business Chat for agents, as


290
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:21,446
well as perhaps for commerce


291
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:22,996
type transactions in Business


292
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,696
Chat, the percentage conversion


293
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,416
rates, all about trying to


294
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,726
figure out how to increase their


295
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,496
productivity and increase my


296
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:31,006
level of customer satisfaction.


297
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:32,096
So your platform needs to


298
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:34,226
support this type of analytics.


299
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,356
So once again four key areas


300
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,906
that we look for when we think


301
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,686
about what qualifies as a great


302
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:41,756
customer service platform


303
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,646
provider for Business Chat.


304
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:45,336
Okay now that you've been


305
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,916
approved there's a couple of key


306
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:47,896
things that we're going to ask


307
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,746
you to do, one is to invest time


308
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:50,836
in training your sales and


309
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:51,866
systems engineers.


310
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:53,916
So we've created three modules


311
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:55,936
that we walk you through, all of


312
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:57,206
your sales and system engineers


313
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,136
wherever they are around the


314
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,196
world about general business


315
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,816
with working with Apple, about


316
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:03,146
implementation and lots of


317
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,396
details that we go into here


318
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:04,976
technically.


319
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,686
And then lastly, about how to


320
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,646
design great user experiences


321
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,366
and how to properly set yourself


322
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,996
up for a great marketing launch.


323
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,186
And then lastly, you need to get


324
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:17,116
ready and help your customers


325
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,216
get ready when it comes to


326
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:20,706
integrating great consumer brand


327
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:22,576
customers and all of their


328
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:23,396
interactions.


329
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,736
And so there's a couple of key


330
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:26,046
things that we want to highlight


331
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:27,156
here that we've learned.


332
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,176
Number one, believe it or not


333
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:31,076
once you become an approved CSP


334
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:32,526
platform you need to make sure


335
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:33,876
you let all your customers know


336
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:34,986
that you are and more


337
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:36,006
importantly, you need to get


338
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:37,626
them to come and register at


339
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,696
registered.apple.com and make


340
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:40,896
sure that they're selecting you


341
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:42,506
in the drop-down menu and


342
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:43,786
notifying you when they have


343
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,076
done that so that the two of you


344
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,076
can actually start working


345
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:47,656
together right from the start.


346
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:50,486
Second of all, in parallel you


347
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:51,676
should be already starting to


348
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,286
integrate to the Business Chat


349
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,986
API, starting an Apple Business


350
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,316
Register and then continuing to


351
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,396
test all of the payloads across


352
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,076
the networks to get ready for


353
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:02,786
helping your customers get ready


354
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:03,316
to launch.


355
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:06,166
And then lastly, you need to


356
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:07,936
start to develop and implement


357
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,636
some great use cases for your


358
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,586
customers and help them get to


359
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:12,706
the point where they're really


360
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,386
ready to actually launch


361
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:16,516
Business Chat.


362
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,076
Okay and then sorry one more


363
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:20,126
point, you do need to notify us


364
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:22,086
when you and your customer or


365
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:24,166
customers are ready for a launch


366
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,526
so that we can do a public


367
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:28,016
launch review, a final QA before


368
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:29,456
we turn you on and publicly


369
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:29,926
launch.


370
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:33,106
So again, these are a couple of


371
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,506
key qualifiers and some


372
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,296
important steps of investment


373
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:37,566
that you need to make as a


374
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,716
potential CSP around the world


375
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,386
for Business Chat.


376
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,706
So let's talk about the consumer


377
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:44,566
brand, some points about how to


378
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,056
get ready, steps to get ready


379
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:47,786
for launching Business Chat as a


380
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:48,546
consumer brand.


381
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:51,146
Number one, the one thing we


382
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:53,616
learned is that Business Chat is


383
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:54,756
an asynchronous, more


384
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,356
asynchronous like communication


385
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:57,556
method is a little different


386
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:59,196
from synchronous and so just to


387
00:11:59,196 --> 00:11:59,916
make sure that everyone


388
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,246
understands what that means I'll


389
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:03,246
illustrate with a quick example


390
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,866
between Hilton and Marriott, a


391
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,036
couple of our partners.


392
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:08,866
I may start a conversation with


393
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,516
the hotel brand looking for a


394
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:12,956
common use case like loyalty


395
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:13,446
points.


396
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:15,646
And I may start that and have a


397
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:17,006
very synchronous communication


398
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,426
back and forth on a Wednesday,


399
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,086
but then I get distracted, I'm


400
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,616
doing other things so a couple


401
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,226
days go by before I come back.


402
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,716
This becomes more asynchronous


403
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,396
now in nature, but because of


404
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,716
the long-lived sessions of


405
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,346
Business Chat and because of the


406
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:32,406
stable identifier about me and


407
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:33,826
because I previously identified


408
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:36,046
who I am a new agent that picks


409
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,516
back up in this conversation


410
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,116
should pick back up right where


411
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,396
we left off, it's not about


412
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:41,186
starting over.


413
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,796
So it's a different etiquette


414
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,146
and so we've come up with some


415
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,256
great guidelines and some help


416
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:48,576
in documents to help get your


417
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:49,976
agents properly trained to be


418
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,526
able to manage these types of


419
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:53,136
conversations differently say


420
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:54,766
from what they may be used to in


421
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,446
live webchat synchronously.


422
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:59,056
You also need to adjust your


423
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,866
KPIs for measuring synchronous


424
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:01,866
versus asynchronous


425
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:02,676
communications.


426
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:03,936
Okay let's talk about


427
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:05,746
integrating Business Chat entry


428
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:06,266
points.


429
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,306
So as you probably remember with


430
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:11,046
Business Chat only users can


431
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,656
initiate a conversation and


432
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:14,036
therefore it's even more


433
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:15,986
important to make sure it's very


434
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,756
easy to discover ways in which


435
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:18,906
to start a Business Chat


436
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:19,576
conversation.


437
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:21,276
So there's two key groups that


438
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:22,256
I'm going to talk about, there's


439
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:24,396
Apple native entry points and


440
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:26,196
then there are your entry points


441
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:27,606
as a consumer brand.


442
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:29,976
Starting with Apple's native


443
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:30,696
entry points.


444
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,466
So when we announced the public


445
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,196
release of Business Chat Beta in


446
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:36,816
March we also announced the


447
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,746
native release of being able to


448
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,416
search for brands in Siri, in


449
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,276
Search, in Safari and in Maps.


450
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,896
And we made this very simple so


451
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,106
that you can go into Business


452
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:49,826
Chat, your Business Chat account


453
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:51,606
in Apple Business Register and


454
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:54,376
set up and configure these entry


455
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,976
points for your business.


456
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:57,566
And in case you haven't


457
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,196
experienced this again here's a


458
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:01,496
quick example where I would


459
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,726
start a search again on iOS on


460
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:04,886
the home screen with a simple


461
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,666
swipe down, I would type in


462
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,366
Discover the brand, I get the


463
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:09,546
search result, the business


464
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:11,326
search result for Discover, I


465
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:12,846
tap on the Business Chat button


466
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,696
and boom I'm right into my


467
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:15,446
conversation.


468
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:17,826
Very easy, three steps.


469
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:20,186
Or coming back to the same


470
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:22,226
search result I may tap on the


471
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:24,066
left side of the search result


472
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,306
and that opens up what we call


473
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,416
the full preview of the business


474
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,986
card, which has a lot of


475
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,626
important information that again


476
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:33,476
as a consumer brand you set up


477
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:35,136
in your Business Chat account in


478
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,936
Apple Business Register, such as


479
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,736
what to expect from your agents


480
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,976
or your automation with response


481
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,816
time to messages or your live


482
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,476
agents' hours of operations


483
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,766
dependent on where they are.


484
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:47,296
So these are all things that you


485
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,826
can set up in your account and


486
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:50,726
configure and update as required


487
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:51,956
in your Business Chat account.


488
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,606
So again, really important to be


489
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,006
taking advantage and setting up


490
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,776
all of these and getting ready


491
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:00,346
to launch in your Business Chat


492
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,276
account in Apple Business


493
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:01,806
Register.


494
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,146
But these are not as important


495
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:06,556
as your entry points and so by


496
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,316
your entry points we mean these


497
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:09,586
are the places in which your


498
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:11,676
customers are most commonly


499
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,006
engaging with you, it's your


500
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,106
content, it's your various


501
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,416
properties, whether it's


502
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,616
websites or apps.


503
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,286
This is where your touch points


504
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,556
are most valuable.


505
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,086
And so we've created the


506
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:23,816
Business Chat button which is an


507
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:26,546
API driven way to embed and


508
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:27,896
initiate an entry point for


509
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,466
Business Chat and it has a


510
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,396
unique URL embedded in it for


511
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:32,416
your business ID.


512
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,536
So let's look at some examples.


513
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,886
This is an example of how TD


514
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,726
Ameritrade has implemented the


515
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,156
Business Chat button in their


516
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,106
mobile website.


517
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:43,806
And so contextually they look


518
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:45,336
for opportunities where there's


519
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:47,036
the highest level of engagement,


520
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:48,746
where their customers typically


521
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:51,116
or prospects start to figure out


522
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,376
okay I want to do something but


523
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:53,656
I'm not sure exactly what to do.


524
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:54,866
And so they place the Business


525
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,086
Chat button there and it's


526
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,446
getting tremendous results


527
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:58,906
because then I can simply tap on


528
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:00,336
it in this contextual call to


529
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,896
action to talk to a TD


530
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,186
Ameritrade advisor and


531
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,796
immediately start a conversation


532
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:05,226
with them.


533
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,606
It's fantastic.


534
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,316
All right, so now let's look at


535
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,616
an example of an in-app


536
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,086
placement of a Business Chat


537
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:11,406
button.


538
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,996
1-800-Flowers in their app have


539
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:15,506
the Business Chat button placed


540
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:16,816
in a number of really important


541
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:19,426
areas again, but I may have


542
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,676
started a conversation with


543
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:22,766
1-800-Flowers a while ago and


544
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:24,566
because of my tray and because I


545
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,636
communicate with so many


546
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:26,776
different people that


547
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:27,816
conversation may have been


548
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,056
pushed way down in my message


549
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:29,286
tray.


550
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:30,956
So in fact you know I'm getting


551
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,346
old, I may have forgotten that I


552
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:33,756
actually had this conversation.


553
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,106
So I may have started a


554
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:37,076
conversation, looking for an


555
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:39,446
opportunity to buy flowers in


556
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:42,736
the 1-800-Flowers app and I spot


557
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:43,606
the Business Chat button and


558
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:44,836
then it comes back to me.


559
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,266
Oh my goodness all I have to do


560
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,246
is tap on that button and once


561
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,306
again it will bring back all the


562
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:51,816
previous conversation because of


563
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:54,166
its long-lived capabilities and


564
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,536
I'm already identified, the


565
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,036
agent welcomes me back and I can


566
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,506
right away get into a productive


567
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,666
conversation to order a new set


568
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,916
of flowers for my wife which are


569
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,016
probably way overdue at this


570
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:04,236
point.


571
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:06,386
All right, so let's talk about


572
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,366
phone calls.


573
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:09,326
There's a huge opportunity that


574
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:10,576
we're discovering with many


575
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:12,526
brands to be able to start to


576
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:15,076
deflect inbound phone calls to


577
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,136
your 1-800 contact centers.


578
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,806
Massive potential here for cost


579
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,386
savings and higher levels of


580
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:22,056
productivity.


581
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,376
And so the idea is at the top of


582
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,665
your IV or your call tree with


583
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:28,136
whatever options you're offering


584
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:29,496
in terms of getting into a queue


585
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,026
for a live agent you offer an


586
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:33,646
option to be able to have an SMS


587
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,706
text message sent to you if you


588
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,226
want to start a conversation in


589
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:38,256
Apple's Messages app.


590
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,606
And that SMS text message would


591
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:42,016
have an embedded link that all


592
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,626
they have to do again is tap on


593
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,386
it and it opens up the Business


594
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:47,066
Chat conversation right in their


595
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,666
Messages app.


596
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:49,336
Again, huge potential


597
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,446
opportunity to be deflecting a


598
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,356
significant amount of inbound


599
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:55,766
costly phone calls to a high


600
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:57,696
productive channel like Business


601
00:17:59,406 --> 00:17:59,506
Chat.


602
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,046
Okay brand email.


603
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,016
So again very targeted because


604
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,106
you obviously have to target


605
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,826
this to specific Apple device


606
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,546
users that most brands track and


607
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,336
know who they are.


608
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:10,736
But a great opportunity where


609
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:12,376
1-800-Flowers is knocking it out


610
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:14,306
of the park being able to target


611
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,216
these emails, offer promotions,


612
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:17,956
remind them of an easy checkout


613
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:20,066
benefit with Apple Pay and again


614
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:21,996
select that button, tap on it


615
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,236
and away you go, you're into a


616
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,006
conversation.


617
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,186
Last key example I'm going to


618
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,936
touch on is QR codes.


619
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:29,506
And so there's lots of


620
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:30,266
opportunities that we're


621
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,716
starting to see pop up where


622
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,036
brands are using QR codes in


623
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:35,576
storefront windows to capture


624
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,116
attention, they're using them at


625
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,716
the checkout lanes, and they're


626
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,356
also using them at check-in at


627
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:40,986
hotels.


628
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:42,416
But this is a great example


629
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,126
where T-Mobile is in fact


630
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,356
exploring the opportunity to


631
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,736
create a post-sale relationship


632
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:49,616
by offering at the end of a


633
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:52,416
conversation in-store on the ID


634
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,526
badge of their in-store advisors


635
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:56,176
the opportunity to start a


636
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,736
conversation right there by


637
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,756
simply holding up your iPhone


638
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:01,306
with the built-in capabilities


639
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,846
of the camera to read the QR


640
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:04,516
code and start a conversation


641
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,926
even before you leave the store.


642
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:08,496
Great way to again personalize


643
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:09,626
that journey with your


644
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,276
customers.


645
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:13,426
All right, so super important


646
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:14,516
that is part of getting ready


647
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:15,896
for a launch that you've thought


648
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:16,766
through and found the most


649
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,436
valuable engagement touch points


650
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:19,726
with your customers and embedded


651
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,866
the Business Chat button as you


652
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,276
launch.


653
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,886
So next key step, two more


654
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:25,306
things.


655
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:27,286
One, preparing your logos


656
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:28,706
because they are well displayed


657
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:29,656
throughout the Business Chat


658
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:31,706
experience and so you have your


659
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,286
square logo and you have your


660
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:33,966
wide logo.


661
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,046
And so as a reminder in case you


662
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:37,476
haven't seen this, the square


663
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,796
logo shows up in a search


664
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,696
result, the square logo shows up


665
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,316
on your actual full business


666
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:44,366
card, it shows up in the message


667
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,046
tray so it easily, you know you


668
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,366
can scan easily and look for the


669
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:47,986
brand that you were


670
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:48,716
communicating with.


671
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:50,436
And then lastly, the wide logo


672
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,476
always the optimal choice to be


673
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:53,786
showing it at the top of every


674
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:54,936
business conversation to


675
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:56,206
reinforce your brand.


676
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:59,256
And it's easy to set up in your


677
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:00,806
Business Chat account once again


678
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:02,446
by simply going into your


679
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:03,886
account, tapping on the Brand


680
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,936
button, uploading your square


681
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:07,316
and wide logos and selecting


682
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:07,906
your background color.


683
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:11,956
Last key point, begin your app


684
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,726
planning early and by that we


685
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,776
mean as you develop your


686
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:17,986
Business Chat team make sure


687
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:19,676
you're pulling in the app team


688
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,706
at the same time.


689
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,126
The combined collaboration of


690
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:25,106
your two groups will deliver a


691
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,426
much more powerful result with


692
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,066
Business Chat user experiences,


693
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:30,326
largely because of the


694
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:31,646
opportunity to take advantage of


695
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,046
iMessage apps as part of that.


696
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:35,296
And so to that point, let's


697
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:36,526
start talking about the brand


698
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,326
developer and Scottie is going


699
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:39,636
to join me back up on stage to


700
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,146
walk us through that and other


701
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:42,846
great app development tools to


702
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:44,266
take advantage of for the best


703
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:45,736
Business Chat user experiences.


704
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:45,946
Scottie.


705
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:52,416
[ Applause ]


706
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,386
>> Thanks Dan.


707
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:56,756
So today I'm going to talk to


708
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,796
you about working with Business


709
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,736
Chat from the perspective of a


710
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:01,566
brand developer.


711
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,896
Now what do we mean by brand


712
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,366
developer.


713
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:06,676
It's not a developer with a


714
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:07,716
bunch of labels all over their


715
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:08,106
clothes.


716
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:10,606
Really what it is is we see


717
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,276
brand developers being in one of


718
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:13,026
three categories.


719
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,386
The first category is maybe


720
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,296
you're working with a CSP, a


721
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:18,926
customer service platform, and


722
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:21,336
you're working to deliver custom


723
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,166
iMessage extensions in-app


724
00:21:23,336 --> 00:21:24,486
experiences for all of the


725
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:25,596
businesses that they work with.


726
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:28,906
The second group is maybe you're


727
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:30,756
a developer working with a


728
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,446
specific brand, a specific


729
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:34,146
company that's signed up to work


730
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:35,606
with Business Chat and you have


731
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:37,296
some great ideas of how you can


732
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,216
make iMessage apps tie into the


733
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,266
transcript to make a great


734
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,456
experience for the customers.


735
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:44,486
The third group we see as maybe


736
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,066
you're not working with anyone


737
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:47,256
at all, but you have some really


738
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:48,706
great ideas of how Business Chat


739
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,426
can come alive with some custom


740
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:51,236
iMessage apps.


741
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:53,726
In the past week we've heard


742
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,316
from a number of you and there's


743
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:56,096
really some exciting


744
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,586
opportunities here for some


745
00:21:57,586 --> 00:21:58,886
great experiences that can


746
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:00,576
potentially be sold to customer


747
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:02,196
service platforms or brands.


748
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:04,556
We've also heard from a lot of


749
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,486
you from all the three


750
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:06,636
categories over the last year


751
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:08,736
and I want to thank you for


752
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:09,976
contacting us because we see


753
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,606
some real great potential and


754
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:13,216
some great user experiences that


755
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:14,276
will come into Business Chat


756
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:15,026
soon, so thank you.


757
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:18,716
Let's start talking about if you


758
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:19,826
even need an app at all.


759
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:21,986
So building custom iMessage apps


760
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:23,776
for Business Chat is great, but


761
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,546
we have some built-in


762
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:26,186
functionality already in every


763
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:26,866
iOS.


764
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,786
So these are the List Picker,


765
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,206
the Time Picker, and Apple Pay.


766
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,196
I went through these last year


767
00:22:33,196 --> 00:22:36,026
in detail, but this year with


768
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:38,006
iOS 12 we heard your feedback


769
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:39,046
and we're adding one of the most


770
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:40,546
requested features which is


771
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:42,286
Authentication new in iOS 12.


772
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:46,086
Great.


773
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:48,926
So let me go through these now.


774
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:50,556
First, we have List Picker.


775
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:52,256
List Picker allows your business


776
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:53,626
to send down a list of products


777
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:56,436
grouped in sections, each


778
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:58,516
section can have a number of


779
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:00,006
different products and new in


780
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,446
iOS 11.3 and above we allow your


781
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:03,986
business to specify if a section


782
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,046
should be a multiple selection


783
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:07,096
or a single selection.


784
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:09,016
Now this is great for some


785
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,536
experiences, such as like trying


786
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:13,176
to order a pizza where maybe the


787
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:15,126
crust is only, you can only have


788
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,666
one crust on your pizza, one


789
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,776
crust type, but the toppings


790
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:20,016
you'd want to offer a range of


791
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,176
toppings the user can select


792
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:21,466
from.


793
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,586
So we allow that section to be


794
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:24,676
have a multiple selection, so


795
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,406
that's new in iOS 11.3.


796
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,736
Next, we have the Time Picker.


797
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:31,546
The Time Picker allows your


798
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,146
business to send a number of


799
00:23:33,256 --> 00:23:35,326
preselected dates and times to


800
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,746
allow your user to select.


801
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:39,026
These also -- the Time Picker


802
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,676
also ties into your local


803
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:43,296
calendar store and will feature


804
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,626
certain conflicts that you may


805
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:47,056
have conflicting with the time


806
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:47,466
selected.


807
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,336
Once you've selected a time and


808
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:51,856
you've sent this back to the


809
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:53,536
business you can easily then add


810
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:54,606
the appointment to your own


811
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:56,606
calendar and even get directions


812
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:57,786
to the event if the company


813
00:23:57,786 --> 00:23:59,766
specifies a location.


814
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:03,226
Next, we have Apple Pay.


815
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:05,556
There's those high heels again.


816
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,636
Apple Pay allows your business


817
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,896
to quickly and easily send the


818
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:10,796
payment request to your


819
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:11,266
customer.


820
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:13,126
The customer all they need to do


821
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:14,526
is tap that bubble, up comes an


822
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:16,086
Apple Pay sheet, they can


823
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:19,756
quickly Face ID, Touch ID and


824
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,206
right within Messages quickly


825
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:21,976
pay your business.


826
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,236
It really wouldn't be Business


827
00:24:23,236 --> 00:24:25,596
Chat without Apple Pay.


828
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:29,116
Now new in iOS 12 we have the


829
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:30,276
Authentication plug-in.


830
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,936
This allows your business


831
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:34,196
quickly to allow you to log in


832
00:24:34,926 --> 00:24:37,486
and then get great customer


833
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:38,846
information from your login.


834
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:40,946
So let me go through that a


835
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,776
little bit more right now.


836
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:45,516
It starts off in a conversation


837
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:46,496
when you get to that point where


838
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:48,446
maybe you need to get a little


839
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,306
bit more details from the


840
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:50,776
customer that would be provided


841
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:51,436
by their account.


842
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:54,826
Now as you see here, the


843
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,986
customer service agent will send


844
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:58,816
down an authentication request.


845
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:01,526
Their user can tap that to sign


846
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:03,066
in, up comes a sheet.


847
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:05,856
This sheet contains a link,


848
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:09,656
basically it's displaying the


849
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:12,426
business' OAuth website directly


850
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:14,146
in the Authentication plug-in.


851
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,926
The user can then tap in to one


852
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:17,796
of the fields and they can


853
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,026
simply enter in their username


854
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:20,566
and password if they have it


855
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:23,536
remembered or they can tap the


856
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:25,916
Password Lock icon which will


857
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,666
bring up a sheet of all the


858
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,516
saved passwords currently


859
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:30,606
already in your keychain.


860
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,656
The domain matched to the one


861
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:35,436
that is provided will be bubbled


862
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:37,106
to the top, you can then select


863
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:37,876
that.


864
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:39,726
The fields that we filled out.


865
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:43,986
And once you log in you can


866
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,996
basically get a response to the


867
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:48,266
business verifying that they're


868
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:48,706
logged in.


869
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,686
So that's great, but how does


870
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:52,206
this all work?


871
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,346
So let me go through that now.


872
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,026
As I mentioned, it starts off


873
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:57,826
with the CSP agent sending an


874
00:25:57,826 --> 00:25:58,936
authentication request.


875
00:26:00,176 --> 00:26:01,846
This includes two pieces of


876
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:02,876
really important information,


877
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:04,666
the first is a public key.


878
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,306
This public key is going to be


879
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:07,916
later used to encrypt the token


880
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:08,806
that you received from the


881
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:10,426
authentication request.


882
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,406
It also includes the URL of


883
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,406
where the OAuth webpage lives


884
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:17,886
and we'll go through that a


885
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,026
little bit more in a minute.


886
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:21,296
So this is where it starts, the


887
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:22,496
authentication request comes


888
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:24,546
down and it passes through, stop


889
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:25,826
on the way at Apple Business


890
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:26,476
Chat Server.


891
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:27,996
Now why do we do this?


892
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:30,166
This we added and we did a lot


893
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,386
of thinking about this about


894
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:32,476
adding security.


895
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:33,986
We want to make sure that your


896
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,536
business has authenticated user


897
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:36,966
to the proper OAuth website.


898
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,646
And for that we make sure it's


899
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:41,256
the proper information that


900
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:42,646
you've already as a business


901
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:44,086
registered through Apple


902
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:45,046
Register previously.


903
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,526
We verify also that the request


904
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:49,966
contains all the required


905
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:50,336
fields.


906
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:52,506
And then finally we deliver it


907
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:53,596
in your Messages app for the


908
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:53,966
customer.


909
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:56,296
From there as I showed you can


910
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:57,246
either type in the password


911
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:59,566
manually or access the system


912
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,846
keychain to pull out any stored


913
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:02,896
credentials that you may have.


914
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:07,176
From here the next step is we go


915
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:09,686
directly to your business server


916
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:11,436
to hit the OAuth website.


917
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:14,716
Now this can be existing or


918
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,186
potentially a little bit change


919
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:18,836
for Business Chat but it allows


920
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:21,186
you to carry the user through


921
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:22,676
your standard login flow,


922
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:24,446
including any extra additional


923
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:27,566
information, extra verification


924
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:28,636
fields, anything along those


925
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:28,926
lines.


926
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:31,526
At the end of OAuth your OAuth


927
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,386
returns a token, this is your


928
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,586
login token and there it's sent


929
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:36,576
back to the Messages app.


930
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,376
What we do next is we encrypt


931
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:39,886
that token so no one else can


932
00:27:39,886 --> 00:27:41,766
see it with a public key that I


933
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:42,616
mentioned earlier that's


934
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:45,436
included in the request.


935
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,066
Now your token is encrypted and


936
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:48,606
it passes back up through the


937
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:50,536
Apple Chat Server which Apple


938
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:53,006
can't read and it lands back to


939
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:53,436
the agent.


940
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,926
Now at this time your agent may


941
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,156
have the private key to decrypt


942
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:00,436
that or your business may have


943
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:02,666
that private key depending on


944
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,056
the relationship and the


945
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:05,356
security that you've worked out.


946
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,536
We think a lot of people will


947
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,526
actually want to send this


948
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:10,846
encrypted token back to the


949
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:13,046
business to verify and decrypt


950
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:15,236
to make sure that this is in


951
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,376
fact the person who has just


952
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:18,596
recently logged in and once


953
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,726
you've decrypted it you can use


954
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,776
that to get all the important


955
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:23,276
customer information sent back


956
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:25,426
to the agent to help service


957
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,726
your account, such as your shoe


958
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,086
size or other order information.


959
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:34,096
So that's Authentication in iOS


960
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:34,476
12.


961
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:36,396
We think a lot of companies,


962
00:28:36,396 --> 00:28:37,866
especially in healthcare and


963
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,006
financial services will really


964
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:39,396
like this.


965
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:41,136
And that's what we have for


966
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,036
built-in features, so you don't


967
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,026
have to write a single line of


968
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,686
code you can take advantage of


969
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:47,446
these by integrating with your


970
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,326
CSPs and your businesses today.


971
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:54,226
So next, you may want to take


972
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:56,586
this further and as I mentioned


973
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:58,576
we heard a lot of great examples


974
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:00,416
of how this can be done and some


975
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:02,036
really great innovative ways.


976
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,416
So today I'm going to talk for


977
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,876
your features how you can


978
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,576
leverage native iOS


979
00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:10,176
functionality, some tips about


980
00:29:10,426 --> 00:29:12,486
making your iMessage apps a


981
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,336
shared app architecture, and


982
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:17,186
talk a little bit about how to


983
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:18,186
make that experience great.


984
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,716
So remember with iMessage apps


985
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:23,176
you can really take advantage of


986
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:25,696
full native iOS frameworks and


987
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:27,286
code throughout the system, such


988
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:28,416
as a front facing camera.


989
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:30,016
Wouldn't it be great if you


990
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:32,016
could try out, have your users


991
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:34,956
send pictures of them using your


992
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,096
products, testing your products


993
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:37,586
or even seeing what kind of


994
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:39,466
situation they are working with


995
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,176
to help give better customer


996
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:41,696
support?


997
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:43,496
This is a whole new level of


998
00:29:43,496 --> 00:29:44,516
interaction that you can have


999
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,726
with your customers by actually


1000
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:47,576
seeing what they're


1001
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:48,206
experiencing.


1002
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:52,456
Remember we have MapKit allowing


1003
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:54,556
your iMessage app to display a


1004
00:29:54,556 --> 00:29:55,736
map and then the business can


1005
00:29:55,736 --> 00:29:58,376
send down things such as places


1006
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,336
that your business may be


1007
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:00,356
operating in in a certain


1008
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:00,906
region.


1009
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:04,046
Or even providing information


1010
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,016
such as drawing custom overlays


1011
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,856
on the map to designate maybe


1012
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:08,886
coverage areas or delivery


1013
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:09,000
zones.


1014
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:14,416
Taking advantage of ARKit


1015
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:16,086
provides a really a whole new


1016
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:17,276
level of interaction where


1017
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:19,006
customers right from Business


1018
00:30:19,006 --> 00:30:21,486
Chat could try out seeing what


1019
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,936
products may look like in their


1020
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:24,706
natural environment right from


1021
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,146
within Business Chat.


1022
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,246
We think these are some really


1023
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,206
powerful examples of using your


1024
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,326
own custom iMessage app.


1025
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,756
So by now you've probably


1026
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:37,206
determined you want to do a


1027
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:39,016
custom app, here's some things


1028
00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:40,126
you can do to get ready for


1029
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:42,226
Business Chat.


1030
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:44,596
First, we'll start by talking


1031
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:46,226
about what it means to have and


1032
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:47,136
leverage a shared app


1033
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:47,706
architecture.


1034
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:52,396
So your business, your brand may


1035
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:55,696
already have a full-fledged iOS


1036
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:57,616
app and when you're working on


1037
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:58,716
your iMessage app as an


1038
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:00,736
extension to that there's


1039
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,226
certain things you can do to


1040
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:02,976
really speed up that


1041
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:03,466
development.


1042
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:07,276
Your main app may have several


1043
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:09,166
business logic classes, a whole


1044
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,186
bunch of utility classes, even


1045
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:12,106
custom views and view


1046
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:13,036
controllers that you could


1047
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,556
easily reuse in your iMessage


1048
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:14,806
app.


1049
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,596
All you have to do is add an


1050
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,106
iMessage app target and then


1051
00:31:20,276 --> 00:31:22,246
check off those classes so


1052
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:23,816
they're provided, also available


1053
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:24,926
in your iMessage app.


1054
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:28,396
Now sometimes code is not the


1055
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:31,496
cleanest and by checking one


1056
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:33,596
class you may have to pull a


1057
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:34,836
whole bunch of other classes


1058
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:37,666
that that represents so that's


1059
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:39,316
not always the best way to go


1060
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,116
about it and we think this is a


1061
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,256
great opportunity where if your


1062
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:44,166
classes aren't fully


1063
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,366
encapsulated it's a great time


1064
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:48,456
for you to potentially refactor


1065
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:50,856
to get your specific business


1066
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:52,916
logic into its own kind of


1067
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,886
encapsulated place for much


1068
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:55,816
better code in the future.


1069
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:58,386
So that's shared core resources,


1070
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:00,406
really you know adding your


1071
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:02,566
iMessage app target to your


1072
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:04,076
project, checking off a few


1073
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:05,526
classes, you can get really far


1074
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:06,076
really quickly.


1075
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:08,516
Next, we have a shared


1076
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:10,156
filesystem between your app and


1077
00:32:10,156 --> 00:32:11,576
your iMessage app.


1078
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:15,006
And with that if your main app


1079
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,946
has already downloaded of images


1080
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:19,766
or files or anything important


1081
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:22,166
that your app needs to do you


1082
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,226
can reference them from your


1083
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:24,836
iMessage app in Business Chat


1084
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,576
without having to redownload


1085
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:28,756
those and provides a much better


1086
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:29,716
customer experience.


1087
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:32,086
You can also go the other way


1088
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:33,466
and save things from your


1089
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:34,836
iMessage app back to the app so


1090
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,806
then when you launch back to the


1091
00:32:37,046 --> 00:32:38,466
app that information is readily


1092
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:38,846
available.


1093
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:42,016
Now that's great for files that


1094
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:44,126
are not really sensitive or need


1095
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,866
to be secured, but if you have


1096
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,486
those needs the system keychain


1097
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:48,276
is also shared.


1098
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,446
So if you were writing down


1099
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,616
potentially even login


1100
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,716
credentials or tokens from a


1101
00:32:53,716 --> 00:32:55,436
previous login in the app you


1102
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:56,746
can quickly make use of those in


1103
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:58,866
your iMessage app and have those


1104
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:00,996
speed up your login process when


1105
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:01,736
using Business Chat.


1106
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:05,816
Even provide you know customer


1107
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,186
data right when launching the


1108
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:08,406
iMessage app.


1109
00:33:11,176 --> 00:33:14,116
Keep in mind, you can always go


1110
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:15,686
from the iMessage app to your


1111
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:16,206
main app.


1112
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:17,596
So let's say you're in a


1113
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,976
Business Chat conversation and


1114
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:21,106
the user is navigating through


1115
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:22,506
your iMessage app and there's


1116
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,076
something that maybe your full


1117
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,476
app would be a better experience


1118
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:27,646
for you can provide a link, as


1119
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:28,536
well as a deep link.


1120
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:29,956
So you can go directly from the


1121
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:31,896
iMessage app directly to the


1122
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:34,076
full app right into the place or


1123
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:35,366
maybe the product or the


1124
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:36,236
information that they were


1125
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:41,056
looking for with just one tap.


1126
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,196
And keep in mind that once you


1127
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:45,776
make these iMessage apps not all


1128
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,876
your customers will have that


1129
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:49,466
preinstalled on their device


1130
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:50,836
right then or all their devices.


1131
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:52,536
So if you run across this


1132
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:55,136
scenario as we showed last year


1133
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:57,336
as well a user just has to tap


1134
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,756
the bubble, up comes an App


1135
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:00,706
Store sheet where they can


1136
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,446
quickly and easily download the


1137
00:34:02,446 --> 00:34:04,436
app and continue right there in


1138
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:06,516
the iMessage conversation having


1139
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:07,716
now downloaded that app and


1140
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:10,896
iMessage app to your device.


1141
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:13,536
So that's covering some great


1142
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:15,176
ways that you can take advantage


1143
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:16,496
of the shared app architecture,


1144
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:18,746
a lot of the code and scenarios


1145
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:20,065
that you've already built with


1146
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:21,866
your main app.


1147
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:24,016
Next, let's talk about the Chat


1148
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:25,176
with Messages button API.


1149
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:27,985
As Dan showed, this is a great


1150
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:30,666
new API that allows your apps to


1151
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,606
leverage this standard Apple


1152
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:35,766
button now in iOS 11.3 and


1153
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,485
above.


1154
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:38,806
There's two ways to use this, we


1155
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:40,376
have the BC Chat button in the


1156
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,045
Business Chat framework which


1157
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:44,295
you can use in your iOS apps and


1158
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:46,235
there's a JavaScript version for


1159
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,666
websites that'll be made


1160
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:48,976
available to you as you sign up


1161
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,735
through Apple Business Register.


1162
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,646
Today I'll show you some code


1163
00:34:54,646 --> 00:34:56,516
examples of how to use the BC


1164
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:58,096
chat button in your iOS apps.


1165
00:34:58,536 --> 00:34:59,866
So here we have an example


1166
00:34:59,946 --> 00:35:02,096
showing the first step I just


1167
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:03,546
have to import the Business Chat


1168
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,076
framework which is on the SDK.


1169
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:07,876
Then I can go ahead and


1170
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:10,426
instantiate a button of the BC


1171
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:12,066
chat button and we allow you to


1172
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,366
pass in some style information


1173
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:15,766
depending on the look and feel


1174
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:16,986
of your app, it may look better


1175
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:18,546
with a light style or a dark


1176
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:19,216
style.


1177
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,236
Then this is a standard button


1178
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:23,306
so I'm going to add a target.


1179
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:24,956
And what you'll note here is


1180
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,216
this is available on iOS and


1181
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:27,746
macOS.


1182
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:30,436
So if you're making Mac apps or


1183
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:32,206
iOS apps you can take advantage


1184
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,266
of this with even a shared code


1185
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,376
to have this available across


1186
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:37,046
your platforms.


1187
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:40,506
Once I've configured the what's


1188
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:41,566
going to happen when I tap the


1189
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:43,646
button I can go ahead and add


1190
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:45,376
this button to my views and


1191
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,636
configure constraints and all


1192
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:48,506
the things to make the button


1193
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:48,876
look great.


1194
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,906
Now that's putting the button in


1195
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:53,406
the app.


1196
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:54,836
So what happens when the user


1197
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:55,446
taps the button?


1198
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:59,526
Well from here as Dan mentioned


1199
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:01,356
in his example he is showing an


1200
00:36:01,356 --> 00:36:02,706
address getting passed through.


1201
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,956
In my example I'm showing here


1202
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,806
that you can programmatically


1203
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,016
define an intent.


1204
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:11,356
Maybe the user is browsing


1205
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:13,346
through your app and has landed


1206
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:14,836
on a certain shoe product.


1207
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:16,426
You could tack on the product


1208
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:18,836
information so right when the


1209
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:20,516
Business Chat conversation comes


1210
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:22,296
alive the customer service agent


1211
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:23,546
already knows the product that


1212
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:24,726
you're referring to.


1213
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,236
The group allows you to specify


1214
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:30,126
potentially where to route on


1215
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:31,506
the backend this conversation,


1216
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:33,346
things like support or maybe


1217
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:35,666
sales would be appropriate or


1218
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,286
other as Dan showed, other


1219
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:39,896
regional based kind of


1220
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:40,576
specifications.


1221
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,916
And then you can also even


1222
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:45,996
specify some default text that


1223
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,006
when the user lands on the


1224
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,416
message conversation will be


1225
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,756
automatically filled in on the


1226
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:52,176
text field so all the user has


1227
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:52,996
to do is hit Send.


1228
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:55,696
Great, so now I've configured


1229
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:58,346
these parameters and the next


1230
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,066
step I do is I call the


1231
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,066
BCChatAction to open the


1232
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,956
transcript and provide the


1233
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:05,526
business identifier which is


1234
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,386
provided to you upon acceptance


1235
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:09,556
into Business Chat through the


1236
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:10,006
register.


1237
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,726
I also send in the parameters so


1238
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:14,706
they are taken up and sent.


1239
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:18,786
At the end of the day once the


1240
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:20,736
user taps that button they're


1241
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:22,556
switched directly to Messages


1242
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,506
into the conversation directly


1243
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:25,256
with that business.


1244
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,596
And the information with intent


1245
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:28,806
and group are provided


1246
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:29,346
automatically.


1247
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:32,186
So that's Chat with Message


1248
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:32,706
button API.


1249
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:35,536
Next, I'm going to talk about


1250
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:36,316
Sandbox testing.


1251
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:39,636
Last year at WWDC we introduced


1252
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:40,896
the Business Chat Sandbox.


1253
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:44,236
Here's the URL and last year I


1254
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:45,946
even gave a demo of how this


1255
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,806
works and how you can make use


1256
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:49,716
of this for your testing.


1257
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:52,496
Here's a screenshot of the


1258
00:37:52,496 --> 00:37:54,366
design and what you see here is


1259
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:55,596
we have tabs across the top


1260
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:57,766
letting you try out all the


1261
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,146
experiences of Business Chat


1262
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:02,756
right from kind of pretending to


1263
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:04,136
be a fake CSP or business.


1264
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,546
Every one of you can log in and


1265
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:08,056
do this today, you don't need


1266
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,086
any approvals.


1267
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,136
You basically can log in and get


1268
00:38:11,136 --> 00:38:12,816
started sending sample text


1269
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:14,416
messages and instantiating all


1270
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,706
of the different built-in


1271
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:16,336
functionality.


1272
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:18,496
As we showed last year you can


1273
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,956
even test out your own custom


1274
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:22,196
iMessage apps by using the My


1275
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:22,716
App tab.


1276
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,596
And new this year for iOS 12


1277
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,156
we've added the Auth tab where


1278
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:29,296
you can try out and play with


1279
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:30,126
the new with the new Auth


1280
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:31,996
functionality, including a


1281
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:33,756
sample OAuth provided webpage


1282
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:34,526
through the Business Chat


1283
00:38:34,526 --> 00:38:35,566
Sandbox which is great.


1284
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:37,716
Or if you have your own OAuth


1285
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:39,766
website already you could


1286
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:41,236
override that and enter your own


1287
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,796
so you can try it out and see if


1288
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:44,156
it works with your business


1289
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:44,586
setup.


1290
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:47,756
So the Sandbox really allows you


1291
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:50,166
to kind of see and feel this and


1292
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,636
we really encourage you to use


1293
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,776
this because you'll kind of,


1294
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:55,016
you'll see the use case and


1295
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:56,206
you'll feel how the use cases


1296
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:56,666
interact.


1297
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,216
We also think it's a great way


1298
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,066
to demo this to maybe


1299
00:39:00,066 --> 00:39:01,476
decision-makers in your business


1300
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,456
so they can make a great, kind


1301
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,086
to fine-tune those experiences


1302
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:05,936
before you go live.


1303
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:08,466
So I can't stress enough how


1304
00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:09,596
valuable this Business Chat


1305
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:11,656
Sandbox can be.


1306
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,486
And finally let's cover some


1307
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:14,236
best practices.


1308
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:17,536
So as I covered, start with the


1309
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:19,356
Sandbox, really see how these


1310
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,676
experiences will look and feel,


1311
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:22,506
try it out with some people.


1312
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:23,656
You can have your you know


1313
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:25,296
laptop set up with Sandbox on


1314
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,586
one side and have someone on the


1315
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:27,636
other side with the device


1316
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,656
trying this interaction out.


1317
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:31,676
Really valuable to kind of see


1318
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,726
and feel how to build these


1319
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:35,466
first-class customer


1320
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:36,006
experiences.


1321
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,486
Then think about enhancing your


1322
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:42,946
app and adding a messages app to


1323
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:44,416
that to really take that


1324
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,516
experience even further.


1325
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:49,326
Now I have a separate bullet


1326
00:39:49,326 --> 00:39:51,276
point about customizing that


1327
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:53,156
user experience specifically


1328
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:55,656
because we want to make sure


1329
00:39:55,656 --> 00:39:57,206
that you understand that


1330
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:58,776
iMessage apps are not the full


1331
00:39:58,826 --> 00:39:58,936
apps.


1332
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:01,296
They are specifically designed


1333
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:03,496
for quick interactions that'll


1334
00:40:04,076 --> 00:40:06,426
add value and not be too


1335
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:07,866
daunting for someone who is in a


1336
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,726
conversation who just wants to


1337
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:11,266
get stuff done with Business


1338
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:11,666
Chat.


1339
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,226
For that we recommend really


1340
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:14,636
taking a look at all the things


1341
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:15,616
you've done in the app and


1342
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,046
what's appropriate in iMessage


1343
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:19,066
apps, but also to custom tailor


1344
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:21,856
it so they kind of fit and flow


1345
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:22,866
into the user experience you're


1346
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:23,306
looking for.


1347
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:26,336
This is also a great way to


1348
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,666
really stand out in Business


1349
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:29,596
Chat and in your customer


1350
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,686
service experiences.


1351
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,346
Then as I mentioned, integrate


1352
00:40:33,546 --> 00:40:35,776
with your message API button, BC


1353
00:40:35,776 --> 00:40:37,326
chat button and add it to your


1354
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:38,766
apps, into your websites and


1355
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:39,000
your emails.


1356
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:44,616
So that's some best practices,


1357
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:47,236
that's what we would like you to


1358
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,736
know about getting started as a


1359
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:50,486
brand developer.


1360
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,026
And now I'm going to hand it


1361
00:40:52,026 --> 00:40:53,976
back to Dan to finish this up.


1362
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:58,676
[ Applause ]


1363
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:00,126
Well done buddy.


1364
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:01,916
Thanks Scottie, that was great.


1365
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,216
And it's super exciting about


1366
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:06,676
finally being able to launch the


1367
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:07,896
OAuth authentication built-in


1368
00:41:07,896 --> 00:41:08,306
feature.


1369
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,076
That is going to be huge because


1370
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:11,906
we have a ton of demand coming


1371
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:12,846
at us for that type of a


1372
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:13,976
built-in functionality, so


1373
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:14,796
that's very exciting.


1374
00:41:15,236 --> 00:41:16,826
All right, some key things.


1375
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:18,366
First of all, we've covered a


1376
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:19,966
lot of highlights today but


1377
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:21,346
there's a lot of great


1378
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,736
documentation and information


1379
00:41:22,736 --> 00:41:25,016
available to you at this link.


1380
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:27,046
And so, please make note of it,


1381
00:41:27,766 --> 00:41:29,146
if you haven't it now you'll be


1382
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:30,416
able to afterwards in the video.


1383
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:33,086
But it will take you to lots of


1384
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:34,466
different documentation that


1385
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:36,296
will cover many of the things


1386
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:37,376
we've talked about would but be


1387
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:38,736
able to drill down much deeper


1388
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:40,106
than that into our getting


1389
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:41,536
started guides and best


1390
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:43,596
practices, again being able to


1391
00:41:43,596 --> 00:41:44,816
get right into understanding how


1392
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,576
to use Business Register, the


1393
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:48,046
Sandbox which is critical of


1394
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:49,716
course, and even last year's


1395
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,016
video which we'd recommend you


1396
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:53,516
revisit to just get again a good


1397
00:41:53,516 --> 00:41:53,996
primer.


1398
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,556
And so I'm going to leave you


1399
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,106
with this one important thought


1400
00:41:58,106 --> 00:41:59,996
that once again today for the


1401
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:01,306
first time we're going to open


1402
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:03,336
the door significantly wider to


1403
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:04,996
medium to large consumer brands


1404
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:06,716
around the world and new


1405
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:09,126
qualified CSPs that can support


1406
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,286
those medium to large consumer


1407
00:42:10,286 --> 00:42:10,836
brands.


1408
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:13,216
And so just as a reminder, if


1409
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:15,336
you feel you're a qualified CSP,


1410
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:17,576
please come right away to Apple


1411
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,696
Business Register and qualify by


1412
00:42:19,696 --> 00:42:20,946
registering and providing us


1413
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:22,796
your information and we'll move


1414
00:42:22,796 --> 00:42:24,996
you through a very rapid process


1415
00:42:24,996 --> 00:42:25,256
now.


1416
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:26,476
So we're speeding up the


1417
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:28,006
approval process in Apple


1418
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:28,776
Business Register.


1419
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:31,256
If you're a consumer brand,


1420
00:42:31,736 --> 00:42:33,116
please again make sure you come


1421
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:34,816
register, make sure you notify


1422
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:36,276
and pick your CSP and then


1423
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:37,656
notify your CSP that you've


1424
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:38,966
selected them so you can start


1425
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:40,786
working together rapidly and


1426
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:41,676
start integrating.


1427
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,176
And then lastly, if you're a


1428
00:42:43,176 --> 00:42:45,436
brand developer once again start


1429
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:47,586
the planning process early, use


1430
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:49,296
the Sandbox to start prototyping


1431
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:50,576
the new OAuth authentication


1432
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:51,816
built-in feature and all the


1433
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:52,876
built-in features.


1434
00:42:53,086 --> 00:42:54,596
It will immediately help you


1435
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:56,696
accelerate the ability to get to


1436
00:42:56,696 --> 00:42:58,556
a Business Chat launch faster.


1437
00:42:58,696 --> 00:43:00,176
And of course take advantage of


1438
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,456
the opportunity to start


1439
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,046
developing your iMessage app as


1440
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:03,876
part of the Business Chat


1441
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:04,566
experience.


1442
00:43:05,196 --> 00:43:06,786
On behalf of Scottie and I thank


1443
00:43:06,786 --> 00:43:07,976
you very much for your time


1444
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,596
today and we'll leave you this


1445
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:11,876
one last message that please go


1446
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:13,146
start getting ready now to


1447
00:43:13,146 --> 00:43:14,136
launch Business Chat.


1448
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:15,396
Thank you very much, have a


1449
00:43:15,396 --> 00:43:15,976
great afternoon.
