1
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,596
>> So, designing for iOS used to


2
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:24,226
be a lot more simple.


3
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:25,706
There was only one phone.


4
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,396
We now have three different


5
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,036
screen sizes for iPhone and


6
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:33,826
three iPad sizes, with different


7
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,806
orientations, and split screens,


8
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:38,206
and multitasking screens.


9
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:41,196
And that might seem like a lot


10
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,326
of different screen sizes to


11
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,016
consider, but there's a basic


12
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:45,746
framework for designing and


13
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,976
building your app that


14
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,076
simplifies the process.


15
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:51,566
This will save you time and your


16
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:53,726
app will look great regardless


17
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:55,546
of what device people are using.


18
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:58,826
The key things to consider are


19
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,836
organizing your screens into


20
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,276
size classes, using Dynamic


21
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:06,006
Type, and taking advantage of


22
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:07,386
standard UI elements.


23
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,786
And all of these things are


24
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:10,956
meant to make it easier for you


25
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:12,436
to design and build your app.


26
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:15,086
So, first let's take a look at


27
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:15,596
size classes.


28
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,466
All screen sizes -- all iOS


29
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:20,836
screen dimensions fall under one


30
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:23,516
of two size classes, compact or


31
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,006
regular.


32
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:26,226
And an easy way to think about


33
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:27,786
this is that the narrower screen


34
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,946
widths are compact size, like an


35
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:30,916
iPhone layout.


36
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,116
And a wider screen widths are


37
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:34,786
regular like the width of an


38
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:35,316
iPad.


39
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:37,866
If you stack all of the screens


40
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,886
on top of each other, in both


41
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:42,446
portrait and in landscape


42
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:44,356
orientations you can see that


43
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,366
size class applies to both width


44
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:46,936
and height.


45
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,446
The goal of creating these two


46
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:51,706
size classes is so that layouts


47
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:54,456
will be flexible and elements


48
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:56,006
will adapt relative to their


49
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:56,776
screen size.


50
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,256
So let me give you a couple


51
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:01,136
examples of what that might


52
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:02,376
potentially mean for your


53
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:02,766
layout.


54
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:07,156
The iPhone 7 Plus in landscape,


55
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:09,966
falls under regular width, which


56
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,616
allows it to use Split Views


57
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:12,776
like all of the iPads.


58
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:15,936
And the two smaller phones in


59
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,096
landscape are compact in both


60
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:18,946
width and height.


61
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,786
This means they will get shorter


62
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:24,106
landscape bar heights than the


63
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:25,506
standard height that you see in


64
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:25,976
portrait.


65
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,866
Screen widths also define UIKit


66
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:32,616
margins and margin, the margin


67
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:34,986
widths can either be standard or


68
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:37,096
like this iPad generous for


69
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:37,816
wider screens.


70
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,746
But in this example and a lot of


71
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:44,036
other cases, text, if text went


72
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:45,586
edge to edge with the UIKit


73
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:47,516
margins then the lines of text


74
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:49,626
would be too long making it hard


75
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,136
for the eye to jump down when


76
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,166
you get to the end of a line.


77
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,436
So, we use readability margins


78
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:58,346
to restrict the line lengths on


79
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,216
larger devices.


80
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,546
These margins are flexible


81
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:02,776
because they can vary with the


82
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:03,476
text size.


83
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:06,286
And smaller text needs more


84
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,616
narrow readability lengths, and


85
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,116
larger text can have longer


86
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:10,546
lengths.


87
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,156
And if you're using Dynamic Type


88
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:14,986
with readability margins, then


89
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,226
people using your app will have


90
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:17,636
a much more comfortable reading


91
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:18,166
experience.


92
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:20,926
So, let's talk more about


93
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:23,676
Dynamic Type, what it is and how


94
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:26,656
it can help people use your app.


95
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:29,286
Dynamic Type are predefined text


96
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,786
styles that can be scaled on a


97
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:33,826
device so that people can see


98
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,316
text at a size that is most


99
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,206
comfortable for them.


100
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:38,176
And there are a lot of people


101
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,416
who find text in their apps to


102
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,926
be way too small to read.


103
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,806
So, using Dynamic Type will


104
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,486
automatically allow text to


105
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:48,566
scale up or down without


106
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:49,746
compromising your layout.


107
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:52,646
And it also makes opting in


108
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:54,446
Accessibility Settings for even


109
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:56,336
larger type, much easier.


110
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,586
It also makes localizing your


111
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:00,286
app seamless.


112
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:01,816
Your text will adjust the


113
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,826
lettering, or line height based


114
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,066
on the height of the characters.


115
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,836
So using these features will


116
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:08,096
only make it easier for more


117
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:10,316
people to use your app.


118
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:12,866
So, this is our Dynamic Type


119
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:13,316
chart.


120
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,366
And this year, we've made some


121
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,086
adjustments to our existing text


122
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,986
styles by increasing the weight


123
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:20,926
of Title sizes from light to


124
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:21,805
regular.


125
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:24,586
In most cases, we recommend


126
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:26,876
using two to three of these text


127
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,376
styles per screen.


128
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,306
But with ten different text


129
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:32,316
styles to choose from, there are


130
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:33,806
countless combinations and a lot


131
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,486
of flexibility when you're


132
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,956
designing your app.


133
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:39,686
The names of the text styles are


134
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:40,756
meant to be descriptive,


135
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:43,606
suggesting where certain styles


136
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:45,066
are most appropriately used.


137
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,926
So for instance, Body is


138
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,986
intended to be used in places


139
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:51,576
where large bodies of text are


140
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:51,916
needed.


141
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,716
And Body is also the default


142
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:54,806
that we use throughout the


143
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:55,326
system.


144
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,216
And from there, we can introduce


145
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:00,776
smaller and larger styles, or in


146
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:03,366
this case bolder, to create


147
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:03,776
hierarchy.


148
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,546
But what if you're using a


149
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:07,996
custom font in your design?


150
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,486
So, this year, with our new API


151
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,536
we have, we can make custom


152
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:15,216
fonts Dynamic as well, which is


153
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:15,616
great.


154
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,576
Keep in mind that you may have


155
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,406
to design -- assign different


156
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,236
point sizes for each text style


157
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:23,196
because not all fonts have the


158
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,106
same proportions.


159
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,396
And this is important for


160
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:27,886
keeping your text optically the


161
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:28,536
same size.


162
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,046
Etsy is a good example of an app


163
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:33,456
that uses Dynamic Type.


164
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:35,616
Here it is at its default size,


165
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,686
and here it is at a much larger


166
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,466
size, and it looks great.


167
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,906
So, last but not least, let's


168
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,536
discuss UIKit Elements.


169
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,106
Rather than focusing effort on


170
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,706
designing a task or function


171
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,526
that people are already familiar


172
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,296
with, we want you to be able to


173
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:55,966
focus your time designing what


174
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,326
makes your app unique.


175
00:05:58,286 --> 00:05:59,636
We have a bunch of standard UI


176
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,076
elements that you can use in


177
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:02,716
your app that will automatically


178
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:04,476
adapt on all screen sizes.


179
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:06,306
So, this includes things like


180
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:08,236
TableViews which not only scale


181
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,216
nicely with Dynamic Type, it


182
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:11,556
also inherits readability


183
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:12,856
margins and standard


184
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,286
interactions, like swipe


185
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,656
actions, and edit mode.


186
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:18,116
And there are a lot of other


187
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:20,186
resources that will help enforce


188
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,536
consistency and adapt seamlessly


189
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:23,556
across devices.


190
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,526
It's important to note that all


191
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:28,066
of these components are scaled


192
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:31,266
for iOS 7, which is the size


193
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,666
that we recommend you start a


194
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,436
new design.


195
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,376
Once you have an iPhone design


196
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,016
we have a couple tips for


197
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:39,266
adapting it to iPad.


198
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,776
So, going back for a minute, we


199
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,546
now know that regular size


200
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:47,256
classes or iPads can use Split


201
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:49,676
Views and to maintain content


202
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:51,476
hierarchy between iPhone and


203
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,696
iPad consider how your app will


204
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:54,366
relay out.


205
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:57,186
The left side of the Split View


206
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:59,266
can be referred to as the Master


207
00:06:59,266 --> 00:06:59,596
View.


208
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,236
And on the right is the Detail


209
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:02,416
View.


210
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,126
And the Detail View on an iPhone


211
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:06,916
would be the page you have to


212
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,586
drill down further to see.


213
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:11,716
Remember, an iPad will share


214
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:14,836
both iPad and iPhone specific


215
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:17,326
layouts and iPad layouts should


216
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,486
maintain the same level of


217
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,586
hierarchy as the iPhone layout


218
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,516
including standard navigation,


219
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:24,066
toolbars, and tab bars.


220
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:26,376
If your app has enabled


221
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,316
multitasking, this will create


222
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:30,116
consistency when your app has to


223
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,866
coexist with another app.


224
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,966
And while in multitasking your


225
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,296
app will transition back and


226
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:39,226
forth between the iPhone layout


227
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,856
or compact, and back to regular


228
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:43,836
size classes depending on its


229
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,186
current screen width.


230
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:47,976
Okay, so to recap.


231
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,546
When designing for iOS, it's


232
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:51,706
important to keep these three


233
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:52,526
things in mind.


234
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:55,876
Considering size class will make


235
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,156
your app look amazing regardless


236
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,036
of what device people are using.


237
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:03,086
Using Dynamic Type will make it


238
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:05,936
easy for your text to scale and


239
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:06,946
translate to different


240
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,946
languages, and this will enable


241
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:11,446
more people to use your app.


242
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,906
And taking advantage of existing


243
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,766
UI elements will free you up


244
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,566
from redesigning and rebuilding


245
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:19,346
features that people might


246
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:20,416
already be familiar with.


247
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:22,896
We encourage you to take


248
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,476
advantage of these tools, not


249
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,336
only to save you time, but so


250
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:28,246
that regardless of what iOS app


251
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,466
people are using, your app


252
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,086
experience will be seamless.


253
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:33,796
Thank you.
