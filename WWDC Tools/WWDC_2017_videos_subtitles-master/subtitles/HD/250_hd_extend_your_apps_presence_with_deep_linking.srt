00:00:17,886 --> 00:00:19,226
>> What are deep links, and how


2
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:20,716
can they be used to extend the


3
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:21,736
presence of your app?


4
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:23,586
Let's start with your app.


5
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,226
It consists of information like


6
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:27,076
videos, photos, or maybe places


7
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,096
and locations, as well as


8
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,586
functions like watching a video,


9
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:32,156
getting directions, or sharing


10
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:32,756
information.


11
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,866
The typical user experience


12
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:35,896
involves knowing that the


13
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,496
content or function exists in


14
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,986
your app; then, navigating


15
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:40,456
through some hierarchy of use in


16
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:41,186
order to find it.


17
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,126
This is called the user journey


18
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:44,066
or user activity.


19
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:46,516
Deep links are a way to offer


20
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,216
direct access to the content and


21
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,356
functions in your app.


22
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:51,526
The way it works is your app is


23
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:53,566
launched, you receive a link,


24
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:54,726
and the app displays the


25
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:55,206
content.


26
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:57,246
The same can be done to complete


27
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:58,236
a function in your app


28
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:58,976
automatically.


29
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,436
Here's an example of launching a


30
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,606
video from a deep link.


31
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:05,296
Note the transitions to orient


32
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:06,876
the user where they are within


33
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:07,146
the app.


34
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:09,136
This helps the user establish


35
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,316
their place and subtly reminds


36
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:12,526
them of how they can navigate


37
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:12,866
back.


38
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:15,606
The way you format a deep link


39
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:17,066
is called a Universal Link.


40
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,576
This is a secure mapping that


41
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:21,476
launches your app.


42
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,436
Best of all, they are universal,


43
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:24,666
and if your app is not


44
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:25,896
installed, it can always fall


45
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:26,676
back to Safari.


46
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:28,946
Here's what it looks like.


47
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:31,866
You have a scheme like https, a


48
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,046
domain, which is the same as


49
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:34,626
your website, and a path to the


50
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:35,186
resource.


51
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,306
The way you get started with


52
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,456
Deep Links is you add an


53
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:41,036
entitlement for all web domains


54
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,046
that your app supports.


55
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,116
You create an app-site


56
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:45,786
association file, which is an


57
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:46,836
adjacent file which contains


58
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,276
data about the URLs that your


59
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:48,886
app can handle.


60
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,276
You then upload that


61
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,866
app-site-association file to


62
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:53,346
your web server and implement


63
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,936
the continueUserActivity method


64
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:55,816
in your App Delegate.


65
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,126
This will pass you a


66
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:58,906
UserActivity object, which will


67
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,846
contain a URL for your Universal


68
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:01,116
Link.


69
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:03,256
There are many times you are


70
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,476
going to want a deep link to


71
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,016
somewhere in your app, and by


72
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:08,096
using Universal Links, you have


73
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:09,476
one clean and simple way of


74
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:09,916
doing that.


75
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:11,926
This presents many opportunities


76
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:13,566
to help new users discover your


77
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,636
app through its content.


78
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:17,186
For example, you can enable a


79
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:18,726
user to share content on social


80
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,786
media, in messaging or email


81
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,106
with Universal Link.


82
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,176
You can create those links on


83
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,796
the web, on your website, or


84
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:26,866
others can link to it from their


85
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,936
website, and it can be


86
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:30,156
catalogued in Search like


87
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:30,636
Spotlight.


88
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:33,656
Universal Links are also a way


89
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,066
to encourage more engagement of


90
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:35,466
you app.


91
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,306
The first way is to have your


92
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:38,996
app be recommended in Siri App


93
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:40,666
Suggestions and Hand Off by


94
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,706
registering your own


95
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:42,776
NSUserActivities.


96
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:45,666
You can create Deep Links in a


97
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,956
lock screen, which to make your


98
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:48,506
content, just a swipe and tap


99
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:48,836
away.


100
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,006
You can launch straight to the


101
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,566
content of your app from the App


102
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,986
icon with Quick Actions.


103
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:56,396
If your app contains content


104
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:57,746
supported by SiriKit, you can


105
00:02:57,746 --> 00:02:59,266
map these to Universal Links.


106
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,856
Other apps can contain your


107
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,586
Universal Links, which can pass


108
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,666
information to your app.


109
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:07,566
If you integrate with the TV


110
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:08,956
app, then you can use Universal


111
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:09,346
Links.


112
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,286
A caveat here is that animation


113
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,126
is not necessary because the


114
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,596
system readies the interface for


115
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:15,996
video content before launching


116
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:16,346
your app.


117
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,536
So, in summary, create Deep


118
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,106
Links to all the app's content


119
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:22,186
and functions that it makes


120
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:24,486
sense for; create a catalog of


121
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:26,176
these using Universal Links;


122
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:28,406
expose all your links to


123
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:29,816
increase discoverability and


124
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:31,006
engagement of your content.


125
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,086
Finally, when launching a


126
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:34,896
Universal Link, use animation to


127
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,596
help keep the user oriented.


128
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:38,696
For more information, see the


129
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,176
resource section of this video.


130
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:41,406
Thank you.
