00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:21,976
>> Hello!


2
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:27,686
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:28,916
Thanks for being here.


4
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:32,366
Thanks for spending part of your


5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,206
WWDC with us, talking about


6
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:36,116
teaching with Swift Playgrounds.


7
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:37,886
My name's Bill Dudney, I'll be


8
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,466
joined shortly by my colleague,


9
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,316
Elizabeth, to talk about


10
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,076
teaching with Swift Playgrounds.


11
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:44,906
So, you might have noticed, over


12
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:46,546
the last few years we started


13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,116
with Hour of Code, and even some


14
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,656
initiatives before that, that


15
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,526
the whole world is now talking


16
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:53,606
about people learning about


17
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:55,416
computational thinking, about


18
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,376
how to program.


19
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,276
In India, in Asia, and Africa,


20
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,746
and the United States.


21
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:02,276
There's big school systems like


22
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:03,876
New York and Chicago talking


23
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:05,346
about teaching all of their kids


24
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:05,946
how to code.


25
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,356
Even heffalumps are learning how


26
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:08,796
to code.


27
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,856
Everywhere, everybody is


28
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:11,856
learning how to code.


29
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,536
And, we are really excited about


30
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:14,836
that.


31
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:17,146
It's such a fantastic time to be


32
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,426
in a place where, to be in a


33
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:20,746
time, where everyone is starting


34
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,746
to talk about coding.


35
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:24,956
So, our talk today is divided


36
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,416
into two major sections.


37
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:27,286
The first one, I'm going to


38
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,686
cover, talking about teaching,


39
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:29,996
and then Elizabeth is going to


40
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:31,166
talk about designing and


41
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,416
implementing playgrounds.


42
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,406
But, those two sections have


43
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:35,946
three main pillars in them.


44
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:38,876
Goal, passion, and audience.


45
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:41,606
So, let's get started with


46
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,586
teaching, and specifically about


47
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:44,236
the goal.


48
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:46,636
Now, as a teacher, you of course


49
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:47,586
have to have a goal.


50
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:48,996
What information is it that you


51
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,616
want to impart to your learners.


52
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,916
But, equally important, is your


53
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:53,836
learner's goal.


54
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:55,496
What is it that your learner is


55
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:56,446
trying to get out of that


56
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:56,946
content?


57
00:01:57,276 --> 00:02:00,116
They need their goal to be front


58
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:01,766
and center of the content so


59
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,996
that they stay motivated,


60
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,276
because while learning to


61
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:06,476
program is not hard, it does


62
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,506
take hard work.


63
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:11,986
So, a place where I'm sure many


64
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,566
of us have been with mathematics


65
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,226
is to either love it, or not,


66
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,296
and I'm sure we all have friends


67
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,116
who don't.


68
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,116
As programmers, probably most of


69
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,446
us are into mathematics.


70
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,706
We've at least played with it,


71
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:26,846
and done some stuff with it.


72
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:28,626
The people who don't get it


73
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:31,296
though, are often, or who aren't


74
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,316
excited by mathematics are often


75
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,316
turned off by it, by some


76
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:36,556
experience where they end up


77
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,126
with this long list of


78
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:38,616
functions.


79
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:42,166
Polynomials, trig, exponentials,


80
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,846
logarithms, their inverses.


81
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,506
Solving for "x."


82
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,176
I remember, when I was younger,


83
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,206
and sitting in my geometry class


84
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:52,256
with my teacher, Mr. Carlin, I


85
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,246
would ask him, probably once a


86
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:57,266
week, I was a real pest, "When


87
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,976
am I ever going to use this?"


88
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,566
And, he would look at me and


89
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,606
say, "Please stop asking me that


90
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:03,996
question."


91
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:06,286
And, eventually, after I've


92
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,716
pestered him enough, he said,


93
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,506
"Look, you're probably never


94
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,226
going to use this, but it's


95
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,796
really cool anyway," and that


96
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:15,396
sort of flipped a bit in my head


97
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,276
to go from looking at math as


98
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:19,476
utilitarian, to looking at math


99
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:20,926
as something that's beautiful


100
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,546
and fun to mess with, like a


101
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:24,076
puzzle to solve.


102
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,106
And so, that really struck me,


103
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,346
and it turned my direction away


104
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,766
from being frustrated with not


105
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:30,796
having some practical


106
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,966
application for it, to enjoying


107
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,496
it just to solve puzzles.


108
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,376
Now, of course, little did Mr.


109
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,326
Carlin know, that I would


110
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,436
eventually become a nerd, and


111
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,106
deal with geometry all the time,


112
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,526
so thank you, Mr. Carlin, for


113
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,156
teaching me geometry despite my


114
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:44,716
resistance.


115
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:50,106
[ Applause ]


116
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,776
So I have a couple of examples


117
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:53,396
that I use to try to explain


118
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:54,746
this concept to people, because


119
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,376
I think it's so important that


120
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:57,596
we think through this, when


121
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:58,946
we're thinking about teaching.


122
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,576
Now, imagine you're trying to


123
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,696
learn how to do art.


124
00:04:03,406 --> 00:04:05,786
But instead of being artistic,


125
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,156
and spreading paint around a


126
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:09,196
canvas, instead, you're


127
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:12,026
encouraged, or forced, to study


128
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,136
the texture of colors, or the


129
00:04:14,136 --> 00:04:15,976
look of the color, or the shape


130
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:18,005
of the brush, but never able to


131
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:18,946
apply that paint.


132
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,726
It would be really hard to stay


133
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,386
focused on learning to become an


134
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,286
artist when you can't do art.


135
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,726
People want to create, they want


136
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,056
to build things, or they want to


137
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:28,786
make things.


138
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,986
And, if you had to study that,


139
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:32,226
it would be very difficult to


140
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,416
get through it.


141
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,896
So much better to let people,


142
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:36,126
when they're learning to paint


143
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:38,336
to make a mess, smear the paint


144
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:39,456
all over the place without


145
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,276
concern, really, for what it


146
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:41,796
looks like.


147
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,396
You can worry about that later.


148
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,186
Same thing with music.


149
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,646
Imagine if you had to know what


150
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:49,066
every dot, every line, every arc


151
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:51,206
on this diagram meant before you


152
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,906
could pick up a guitar, or start


153
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,896
playing with your piano.


154
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,166
It would be very difficult to


155
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,026
get through all that.


156
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,606
So, I encourage people who are


157
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,136
thinking about teaching to start


158
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:02,946
with a question.


159
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,106
That question is what drives the


160
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,066
learner's goal.


161
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,986
From that question, the learner


162
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,986
drives internal motivation to


163
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:12,986
achieve the hard work of


164
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:13,916
learning the material you're


165
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,006
trying to get across.


166
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,356
Which brings us next, to the


167
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:18,006
audience.


168
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:20,476
It is so important that we as


169
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:21,756
teachers think through the


170
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,536
audience that we're aiming to


171
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:24,006
reach.


172
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:25,716
Are they brand new coders?


173
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,386
Do they understand anything with


174
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:27,776
coding?


175
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,406
Or, are they moderately


176
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:30,526
experienced and they're trying


177
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:32,096
to gain more insight into some


178
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:33,376
particular piece of material?


179
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:34,916
You need to know who your


180
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,676
audience is and then make your


181
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:38,676
content communicate to them.


182
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:41,996
What I often see happening is


183
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,796
people taking syntax and other


184
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:47,056
things from a computer science


185
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,166
degree in college and then sort


186
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,866
of moving it down to a level so


187
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,796
younger people can understand


188
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:52,926
it.


189
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,516
So, you end up with this huge


190
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:56,246
cloud of concepts that you have


191
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,976
to get down, all these syntax


192
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:58,396
items.


193
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,166
Now, of course, it's very


194
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,006
important that you understand


195
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:04,516
syntax, you can't code without


196
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,526
knowing what syntax is, so in


197
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:07,686
Learn to Code, the way we


198
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:09,416
approach that, is that we build


199
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,016
this engaging world with these


200
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,706
great characters and these silly


201
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,766
animations, and beautiful audio


202
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,766
to engage the learner so that


203
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:19,046
they'll go through the hard work


204
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,676
of learning what a for loop is.


205
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,276
Here's an example of one puzzle


206
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,646
that we have that takes Byte


207
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:24,866
around the four sides of this


208
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,246
world, picking up gems.


209
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,036
In order to do that, you of


210
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:30,336
course use a for loop, and we


211
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,896
have that stated at the top of


212
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,646
the page, but that's not the


213
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:34,216
goal.


214
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:35,676
The learner's goal is to pick up


215
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,216
these items and to solve the


216
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:37,786
puzzle.


217
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,546
And so, we use that goal to


218
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,376
drive an internal motivation to


219
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,266
go and learn what a for loop is.


220
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,626
The next step is often to dive


221
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,596
into something like algorithms


222
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:48,536
and data structures.


223
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:52,216
I love all these algorithms.


224
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:54,716
Half of these names, I looked


225
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:56,196
and thought, Hmm, I wonder what


226
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:57,366
that is, and I almost got


227
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:58,566
distracted from prepping my


228
00:06:58,566 --> 00:06:59,996
slides by digging into what is


229
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:00,556
Soundex.


230
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:00,943

00:07:07,546 --> 00:07:08,786
I don't know how many of you


233
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:09,876
have interacted with younger


234
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,626
people, but I doubt very


235
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,196
seriously-- well, many of you


236
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:15,336
are much younger than me, I


237
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,316
know, but I'm talking about


238
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:19,056
young learners in school.


239
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,006
How many of them have come to


240
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,676
you with a bucket of integers


241
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,116
and said, "You know, I really


242
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:25,236
wish you would help me sort


243
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:25,726
these."


244
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:28,636
That's never happened.


245
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:30,916
No one wants to learn about


246
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,626
sorting, they have a goal and


247
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:33,966
sorting will help them achieve


248
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,226
that goal, so you want to focus


249
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:38,246
on the audience's goals and then


250
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:39,766
help them achieve those goals.


251
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,936
So, again back here to Learn to


252
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,406

253
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:44,576
algorithmic learning and

00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:46,326
computational thinking, or when


255
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:47,726
we're thinking about using those


256
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:50,516
concepts to teach people, we


257
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,026
build this content like this


258
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:53,466
same simple puzzle that we saw


259
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,846
earlier, that's drawing the


260
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:56,536
learner in to thinking about


261
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,286
what an algorithm is, without


262
00:07:58,286 --> 00:07:59,386
even using the word.


263
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,856
Then, later when we get close to


264
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,116
the end of Learn to Code 1, we


265
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,276
approach this puzzle.


266
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,476
This puzzle is a challenge page


267
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:10,606
and says to the learner, Hey, go


268
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:11,096
nuts.


269
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:12,626
Solve this in any way that you


270
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,516
want to in the most efficient


271
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,036
way that you see possible.


272
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,476
But, this is after a long time


273
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:19,636
of solving these puzzles where


274
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,306
they start to understand and


275
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,046
think algorithmically, so they


276
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:24,346
look at this and think, Oh,


277
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:25,686
there's two diamonds, or there's


278
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,716
two gems, and there's two things


279
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,346
I need to flip.


280
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:31,056
And, that's just programming the


281
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:31,796
easy parts.


282
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:33,895
In the beginning, when I started


283
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,596
programming, I would not have


284
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:37,775
built the WWDC app, properly.


285
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:39,116
I wouldn't have made a table


286
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:41,135
view controller and a cell and a


287
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:41,645
model.


288
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:42,966
I would just dump all the code


289
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:43,926
into the view controller,


290
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,906
because I read MVC when I first


291
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,336
got started, and I had no idea


292
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:49,006
what that meant.


293
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:50,736
Modeling is difficult, the


294
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:52,796
syntax and the algorithms, and


295
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:54,526
so forth are the straightforward


296
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:54,786
part.


297
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,246
So, another thing that I notice


298
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,926
that people get bogged down in


299
00:08:58,926 --> 00:08:59,866
when they're thinking about


300
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,896
teaching this stuff is, to focus


301
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:02,916
on details.


302
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,206
Now, of course, the details,


303
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:05,376
they're really important.


304
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,736
Several years ago, I thought, I


305
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,566
really want to learn to do 3D


306
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:10,196
programming.


307
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,316
I've always thought it's really


308
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,766
cool, I love how fast it is, and


309
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:14,826
the parallel nature of it.


310
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:16,836
So, I started diving into Open


311
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:17,286
GL.


312
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,726
Bought a couple of books, and


313
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,276
without question, every one of


314
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:22,676
those books had this diagram in


315
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:22,786
it.

test.

00:09:36,596 --> 00:09:38,336
Now, here's a picture of a dog

So, when you're first getting


328
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:55,506
started with 3D graphics,


329
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:57,066
looking at this diagram, it's


330
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,556
very hard to make heads or tails


331
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,376
of it, you might as well be

looking at a picture of a puppy.

00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:04,676
focus on fun.

If I were teaching 3D graphics,


337
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,486
I would start with fun stuff,


338
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,786
like Byte doing his silly dance,


339
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:14,666

great.

Now, of course, everything in


343
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,366
that diagram-- vertex shaders


344
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:24,416
and primitive processing and so


345
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,656
forth-- all of that is really


346
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:26,946
important to getting every

00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:29,526

there.

383
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:39,636
>> Thank you, Bill.


384
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:42,206
For that awesome introduction.


385
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,476
I don't even know how to follow


386
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:44,196
his jokes.


387
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,786
My name is Elizabeth, and I'm a


388
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:50,006
content engineer, writer, and


389
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,396
storyteller on the Swift


390
00:11:51,396 --> 00:11:52,376
Playgrounds team.


391
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,266
I'm really excited to be here


392
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,496
today, the last session of WWDC


393
00:11:57,496 --> 00:12:00,346
2017 to teach you how to bring


394
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,026
those ideals: goal, audience,


395
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:05,226
and passion into your Swift


396
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:05,846
Playgrounds.


397
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:07,866
So, let's start at the


398
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:08,386
beginning.


399
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,706
What is a Swift Playground?


400
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,776
Some of you, all our scholarship


401
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,146
students, know intimately what a


402
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:17,556
Swift Playground is, because you


403
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,886
had to make your own to get


404
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:19,176
here.


405
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:21,126
Others of you might have played


406
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,606
with these, might have learned


407
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,966
from one yourself, how the


408
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,016
beginnings of coding.


409
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,906
A Swift Playground is


410
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:29,736
essentially a collection of


411
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,596
pages, like this one.


412
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:35,036
You can see on the left hand


413
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,656
side, the prose section.


414
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,996
At the top are the instructions,


415
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:42,496
the story, whatever concept


416
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,646
you're trying to get across to


417
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:44,296
your learners.


418
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:45,966
This is where you're going to


419
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:47,176
teach them what they're about to


420
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:47,586
do.


421
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,656
On the bottom, on the right hand


422
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:53,056
side is the user code section.


423
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,646
This is the fun part where


424
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:55,336
they're really going to be


425
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:57,736
creating, manipulating, trying


426
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:58,976
out what you've taught them.


427
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,696
And then on the right hand side,


428
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:03,996
the live view.


429
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:05,866
This is where you're going to


430
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,696
bring your passion to this.


431
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:09,996
Look how fun this world looks.


432
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,276
I want to dive right in there


433
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:12,916
and learn how to code in Byte's


434
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:13,316
world.


435
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,366
It's colorful, it's exciting.


436
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:17,076
This is where the learner's code


437
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:18,456
is going to execute, where


438
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,386
they're going to see what


439
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,376
they've created.


440
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,166
This is your point, to get them


441
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,636
interested in whatever it is


442
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,896
you're trying to teach them.


443
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,506
In addition to these collection


444
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,016
of pages that make up a Swift


445
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:31,616
Playground, there are a few


446
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:33,176
other features that you can add


447
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,296
to make your experiences really


448
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:35,766
gripping.


449
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,276
There we go.


450
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:43,746
One of the first ones is


451
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:44,486
Cutscenes.


452
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:45,776
If you're familiar with the


453
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,176
Learn to Codes, then you'll


454
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,206
probably have seen some of


455
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:48,506
these.


456
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,576
We typically add them at the


457
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,056
beginning of new chapters, or


458
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,936
new sections, to introduce a


459
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:57,666
concept in a fun, animated way.


460
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,956
These are written in HTML, and


461
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,406
they're a good way to introduce


462
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:04,196
a new topic before you dive


463
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:05,286
straight into the code.


464
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:06,286
Give the learner a sense of


465
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:06,956
where it is they're going.


466
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:12,496
You can also add hints to your


467
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,116
playground books.


468
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,266
These are so important for


469
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,486
giving the learner a contextual


470
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,316
sense of where they're going


471
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:20,866
wrong.


472
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:22,256
You can do a bit of


473
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,576
introspecting on the learner's


474
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,096
code in order to figure out


475
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,036
exactly what mistake they might


476
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,176
have made, and offer them


477
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,126
tailored help.


478
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,216
It's incredibly engaging to have


479
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,916
software understand what you


480
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,656
need specifically instead of a


481
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,396
one size fits all sort of


482
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:37,086
experience.


483
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,016
So, use hints.


484
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,016
One thing to keep in mind with


485
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:42,196
hints is that some learners


486
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:44,476
really don't like the extra


487
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:45,686
help, they want to do it


488
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:46,286
themselves.


489
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:47,876
So don't put essential


490
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,246
information to solving the


491
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:50,116
problem in here.


492
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:51,956
Make these real hints for those


493
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,396
who need them.


494
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,586
If hints aren't enough, you can


495
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:58,276
also add solutions to your


496
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,246
playground pages.


497
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,146
These are essential.


498
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:02,756
Think about the first time you


499
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:03,636
were trying to learn a new


500
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,386
technology.


501
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:06,246
Could you do it just with


502
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:07,936
someone explaining conceptually?


503
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,176
Or, did you need to look at a


504
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,256
reference example?


505
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,776
These are so helpful for your


506
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:14,076
learners that get stuck and


507
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:15,336
aren't sure of the syntax,


508
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:16,696
aren't sure how to go on.


509
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,656
The solution gives them that


510
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:19,576
help they need.


511
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:20,676
Otherwise they might get


512
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:21,916
frustrated and leave your


513
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,116
playground book entirely.


514
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:28,616
You can also add assessments at


515
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:28,886
the end.


516
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,686
These typically pop up once the


517
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,546
learner has completed the task


518
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:34,626
that you've set them.


519
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:37,106
You can also customize these


520
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,926
depending on how your learner


521
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:39,856
has solved the puzzle.


522
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,986
Maybe you wanted them to use for


523
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:43,436
loops, but they used repeated


524
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:44,476
code instead.


525
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,346
Now's your chance to suggest to


526
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,246
them, great job, you completed


527
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,426
the puzzle, but maybe next time,


528
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:51,406
use a for loop instead.


529
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,256
It's a little bit better of a


530
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:53,796
paradigm.


531
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,236
Alright. So we're all set,


532
00:15:58,286 --> 00:15:58,656
right?


533
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:00,886
We know about pages, we know


534
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:03,176
about assessments and hints,


535
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:04,786
it's coding time.


536
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,316
Not so. We went ahead to the


537
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,046
drawing board.


538
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:10,596
Literally.


539
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,666
These are some of my actual


540
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,366
notes in the actual notebook


541
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:16,086
that I keep when I'm designing


542
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:17,026
for Swift Playgrounds.


543
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:19,676
Quick sketches, just getting


544
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:21,406
thoughts out of my brain onto


545
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:21,976
the paper.


546
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,646
I might have a thought while I'm


547
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,646
riding the shuttle, or in the


548
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:27,046
shower, and I just want to get


549
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,276
that down somewhere so that I


550
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:29,566
can iterate on it later.


551
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:32,356
Starting out writing code, is a


552
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,836
really expensive way to


553
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:34,456
prototype.


554
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,206
You might spend weeks getting a


555
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:38,176
cool working demo ready, and


556
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:39,476
then show it to a potential


557
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,266
learner, and they are totally


558
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,136
lost, or they think it's boring.


559
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:44,786
Well, now you're stuck and you


560
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,686
have to redo all of those weeks


561
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:47,426
of coding work.


562
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,586
Instead, start with cheap


563
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:51,566
prototyping.


564
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,796
It's just as easy to show a set


565
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,836
of storyboards on a whiteboard,


566
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:58,266
or in a KeyNote even, to some


567
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,576
potential learners, to some of


568
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:01,296
your colleagues to get feedback


569
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:02,576
in that initial stage.


570
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:07,915
So we're all set now.


571
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,116
We've got the main parts of the


572
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,996
playground book in mind, we


573
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,106
understand we want to start out


574
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,596
with cheap, fast prototyping, so


575
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:17,336
now let's take those ideals that


576
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,236
Bill taught us about, and put


577
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,266
them into practice.


578
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,036
What is the learner's goal?


579
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,126
I want to take a minute here to


580
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,016
help you separate in your minds


581
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,506
the actual different goals that


582
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,236
are going on.


583
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:31,746
There's your goal as the author.


584
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,146
What do you want your learner to


585
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:35,496
get out of the whole playground,


586
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,026
and of each individual page?


587
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:39,736
Those are separate goals.


588
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,346
Your learner, as well, has a


589
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:44,966
goal on a per-page basis, and


590
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,496
throughout the whole playground


591
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:46,786
book.


592
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,046
For example, in Cipher, a


593
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,536
cryptography-focused playground,


594
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,046
we released recently, the


595
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,776
learner's goal is to solve the


596
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:55,326
mystery over the course of the


597
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:55,916
pages.


598
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,256
They find this encrypted note


599
00:17:57,496 --> 00:17:58,506
and want to figure out what it


600
00:17:58,506 --> 00:17:58,906
means.


601
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,746
My goal as the author is to get


602
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,476
them interested in cryptography


603
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,046
and give them a few new words,


604
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,086
plain text, ciphertext, just to


605
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,526
spark that interest in a


606
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:09,526
potential discipline.


607
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:12,686
So, keep those goals in mind and


608
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:14,036
figure out how you can make them


609
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:16,156
intermarry in the best way, to


610
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:17,496
fully support your learner in


611
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,226
their experience.


612
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:22,386
So now, let's walk through some


613
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:23,856
potential goals that you might


614
00:18:23,856 --> 00:18:25,516
have, and that we often use in


615
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:29,316
Swift Playgrounds on each page.


616
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,196
Completing a task.


617
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,316
This one's probably the most


618
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:33,846
familiar to a lot of you.


619
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,336
We use this a lot in the Learn


620
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:35,836
to Codes.


621
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,416
Collect all the gems, flip two


622
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,626
switches, and collect one gem,


623
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:42,086
place the expert in the right


624
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:42,416
area.


625
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,506
These are easy for the learner


626
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,876
to understand what you want them


627
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:46,496
to do.


628
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:47,776
They have a clear starting


629
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,826
point, a clear ending point, and


630
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:51,036
these are easy for you to


631
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:52,526
assess, and offer that


632
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,506
personalized-- those


633
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,046
personalized hints and


634
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:58,096
assessments at the end.


635
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:58,706
Experiment.


636
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,936
I love these kind of pages,


637
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:02,486
because I like to play around


638
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:03,496
with the code I'm given.


639
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,596
These are a really good way to


640
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:07,316
introduce learners to something


641
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,506
complex, to give them a sense of


642
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,416
where they're going before they


643
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,696
dive in to the code.


644
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,566
We often use this by showing a


645
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,886
whole big block of code, maybe


646
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:19,406
new functions the learner hasn't


647
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:21,566
seen yet, maybe new variables,


648
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,446
even new concepts, and then we


649
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:24,796
minimize the amount of code


650
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,216
that's actually editable to


651
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,866
them, so they're not overwhelmed


652
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,596
by seeing, whoa, this is a lot


653
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:30,376
of new stuff.


654
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,566
Instead, they can pick out the


655
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,186
parts.


656
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,696
"I know how to change a color, I


657
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:36,366
know how to change a radius to


658
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:36,646
negative."


659
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:38,746
And, they can experiment, and


660
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:40,306
have fun with this thing that


661
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,556
they're about to dive more


662
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,436
deeply into.


663
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:45,926
Practicing a new skill.


664
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,816
I'm hoping you all practice a


665
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:49,846
new skill right now.


666
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,586
Bill taught us about goal,


667
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,996
audience, and passion, and I'm


668
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:56,236
reiterating that to you now.


669
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:57,386
So, that hopefully when you


670
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:59,186
leave this room, you have those


671
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,716
three concepts in your mind.


672
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:04,656
Learners won't grok a concept


673
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,286
immediately, the first time.


674
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:07,986
You might wish they would, but


675
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,256
I'm sure through experience;


676
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:10,496
think back to when you first


677
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:11,566
learned a new, complicated


678
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:11,936
thing.


679
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,286
Could you have written a


680
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:14,886
definition, explained it to one


681
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:16,266
of your colleagues immediately?


682
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,466
No, you needed to practice that


683
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,066
skill, to use it in different


684
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,146
contexts so that you can then go


685
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:23,896
and apply that to some new


686
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:24,336
place.


687
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,736
So, really important to include


688
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:28,226
these types of pages in your


689
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,446
playground book.


690
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,606
Think about a concept.


691
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,236
This one is sort of different.


692
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,636
We talk a lot about code and the


693
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,566
learner code on each page, but


694
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,176
often in the Learn to Codes and


695
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:42,486
the challenges in all of your


696
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:43,646
playground books, you're


697
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:45,386
introducing something totally


698
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:46,106
new.


699
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:48,016
In the cryptography playground,


700
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,526
I'm introducing all of


701
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:50,646
cryptography, and there's


702
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,036
complicated words like


703
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,216
ciphertext and key and message.


704
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:56,276
That's a lot of new information


705
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:57,636
for a learner to take in.


706
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,256
And, you want to make sure you


707
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:00,406
give them that space.


708
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:04,956
To read, understand, and reflect


709
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,526
on what you're telling them.


710
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:08,866
We have several pages that don't


711
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,606
have any user coding on a page,


712
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,276
because those pages are


713
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,316
concept-heavy.


714
00:21:13,696 --> 00:21:14,896
And, we want to give the learner


715
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,256
that space.


716
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,806
Finally, create.


717
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:21,686
These pages are awesome.


718
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,226
This is where you really get to


719
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:24,826
show your skills, show what


720
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,516
you've learned.


721
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:28,126
We've given you, the author, all


722
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,426
the tools you need, and now the


723
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:32,456
learner is able to go nuts.


724
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:34,526
They know how to change colors,


725
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,296
they know how to add functions,


726
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,846
they can make the robot dance,


727
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:38,876
but they couldn't before.


728
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,566
This is their chance to really


729
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,656
explore, and to feel empowered.


730
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:44,126
This is why they came to coding.


731
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,926
Why did you all come to coding?


732
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,366
Probably to do something.


733
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:48,176
To learn something.


734
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,326
To create something.


735
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:51,176
Keep that in mind, that that's


736
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,396
likely what's in your learners'


737
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,166
minds too.


738
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:54,146
That they want to create


739
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:54,696
something.


740
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,006
And so, give them that


741
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:56,716
opportunity.


742
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,346
Include a wide variety of these


743
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:00,676
types of pages in your


744
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:02,126
playgrounds, and you'll keep


745
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:03,356
your learners engaged,


746
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:04,936
interested, and excited for


747
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:06,346
what's coming next.


748
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:09,746
So, how do we do all of this?


749
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:12,226
How do we get the learner to


750
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:12,936
these places?


751
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:14,276
How to create these pages?


752
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:17,296
Well, in Swift Playgrounds


753
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,086
itself, you have several prose


754
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:22,386
tools available to you.


755
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:24,706
Number one is glossary entries.


756
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,446
These are incredibly important


757
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,006
especially when thinking about


758
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:30,196
your audience.


759
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,456
Another one of those big,


760
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:32,146
important points.


761
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,426
Algorithm might be a simple word


762
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:37,266
for all of you, many of you.


763
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,706
You're coders, you're


764
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:40,416
programmers, you've been around


765
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,586
the block, and you know what an


766
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:43,306
algorithm is.


767
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:45,706
But, a beginner, who's brand new


768
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:47,256
to coding, that's a difficult


769
00:22:47,256 --> 00:22:47,626
word.


770
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,626
Something they can't just intuit


771
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,646
from reading the rest of your


772
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:51,156
prose.


773
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,016
And so, offering this glossary


774
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,686
entry, which is triggered in


775
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:55,866
Swift Playgrounds just by


776
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,026
tapping on that differently


777
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,756
colored word, gives them the


778
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,806
support they need to keep on


779
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:01,996
with your playground book.


780
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:04,486
Keep in mind, you, as the


781
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:05,966
author, are not going to be


782
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:07,386
there to pop out of the page,


783
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,956
and tell your learner something


784
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:09,886
when they're having trouble.


785
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,996
You need to communicate solely


786
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,156
via the medium of text.


787
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,136
And so, you want to use all the


788
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:16,806
tools at your disposal to give


789
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,206
extra help where it's needed,


790
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:20,536
and support your learner in


791
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:21,046
their process.


792
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,816
A great way to figure out what


793
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,436
kinds of glossary entries you're


794
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:27,196
going to need is by user


795
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:27,786
testing.


796
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,776
Put this in the prototyping


797
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,186
stage when you get some prose


798
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:32,406
written down in front of


799
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:34,526
learners, and listen to them.


800
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,566
What words don't they


801
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:36,236
understand?


802
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,846
What concept did they clearly


803
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:39,136
not get because they skipped


804
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:40,366
over a vocab word?


805
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:41,706
And, include these in your


806
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:42,556
glossary entries.


807
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,436
It's also worth noting, that, if


808
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:47,296
you're localizing your


809
00:23:47,296 --> 00:23:48,756
playground, you can add


810
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,346
additional glossary entries in


811
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,916
different localized languages.


812
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:53,466
So, that if there's something


813
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,226
jargon-y that maybe an English


814
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,676
speaker would understand, you


815
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:58,336
can offer a glossary entry to


816
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,066
that in another language.


817
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:02,356
So, keep that in mind.


818
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:07,276
Take a minute to read this


819
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:07,976
definition.


820
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:15,946
You all feel confident about


821
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:17,016
substitution ciphers?


822
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:18,416
You could send me a message


823
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,126
right now in substitution cipher


824
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,076
with a shift of 3?


825
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:24,326
What about if I also gave you


826
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:25,246
this diagram?


827
00:24:26,496 --> 00:24:28,026
This is much more valuable.


828
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:30,116
It's helpful to have both,


829
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:30,916
definitely.


830
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,416
The diagram on its own wouldn't


831
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,306
do it, but just the prose


832
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,406
without this visual, impactful


833
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:37,116
picture?


834
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:38,986
Is not going to cut it either.


835
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,506
It's so helpful to have visual


836
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:44,146
aids in explaining difficult


837
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:44,856
concepts.


838
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:48,176
Do keep in mind, that if you add


839
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,776
visual aids, which you can add


840
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:51,656
in that prose section, right in


841
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,056
the prose, that you want to make


842
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,446
sure they have accessibility


843
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:56,526
labels, so that your users using


844
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,216
VoiceOver have just as rich of


845
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:00,046
an experience as those who are


846
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:00,976
not using VoiceOver.


847
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:06,576
Here's a wall of text.


848
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:08,736
Lots of stuff going on here.


849
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:11,516
Luckily, there's a callout.


850
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,726
I know which part of this I need


851
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:14,596
to pay attention to.


852
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:16,286
Right here, new awesome


853
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:16,846
function.


854
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:17,946
I'm ready to go.


855
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,316
In a lot of our user testing,


856
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,196
users, no matter what age group,


857
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,336
what experience level, often


858
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,436
skim the prose.


859
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:27,866
They want to get right into


860
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:29,766
coding, they don't care about


861
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:31,206
all the awesome instructions


862
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:32,646
you've given, you've slaved over


863
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:33,146
for weeks.


864
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,986
They just want to get in there


865
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:36,086
and write some code.


866
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:37,216
And so, support that.


867
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,986
Give people their tl;dr, too


868
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,396
long; didn't read it version, in


869
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:43,006
the middle so they can get right


870
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:43,386
in there.


871
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,416
Still, offer them that prose


872
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:47,636
support, around it.


873
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:49,466
If your learner does dive right


874
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:50,646
in, tries out new awesome


875
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:52,096
function, and it doesn't do what


876
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,036
they expected, they need to be


877
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:56,076
able to come back and read about


878
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,696
it, and find out what it does.


879
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,016
It's all about supporting your


880
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,616
learner in every aspect you


881
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:02,926
think they might need support.


882
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:09,066
Finally, the shortcut bar.


883
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:11,996
This might not seem like a prose


884
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:14,246
tool, but it's incredibly


885
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:14,866
important.


886
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,716
And you, as the authors, have


887
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,456
control over what appears in


888
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:19,396
this shortcut bar.


889
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,336
This is how your learner is


890
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,486
going to start coding.


891
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:23,796
This is how they're doing it on


892
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:24,476
an iPad.


893
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:26,696
Tapping functions, tapping


894
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,706
keywords.


895
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,096
This is their main toolbox.


896
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:34,216
So, make it easy to use.


897
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:36,866
Only include relevant choices.


898
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,166
If your learner's on page tw0 of


899
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,616
your playground book, and you


900
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:42,686
have functions from page six and


901
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,166
seven in that shortcut bar,


902
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,116
that's going to be exhausting


903
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:46,696
and distracting.


904
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:47,956
They're going to have to scroll


905
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,826
through, finally get to the


906
00:26:49,826 --> 00:26:50,936
functions they wanted for this


907
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:52,476
page, and wonder why they had


908
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:53,606
all these extra functions in the


909
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:53,936
middle.


910
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:55,946
It might even be confusing.


911
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:57,596
Maybe they thought they needed


912
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:58,806
to use those other functions.


913
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:00,186
But, they don't, and now they're


914
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:00,866
not sure.


915
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:01,726
And, you haven't gotten your


916
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,176
point across as well as you


917
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,566
might have.


918
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,676
Use concise method names.


919
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,166
This one can be a little tough,


920
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:13,136
because sometimes the method's


921
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:14,386
got to say what it's got to say,


922
00:27:14,936 --> 00:27:15,686
but do your best.


923
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,786
The one I have here, "shift word


924
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,306
by," easy, fits on the screen,


925
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:22,886
and it's easy for the learner to


926
00:27:22,886 --> 00:27:23,636
understand.


927
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:25,706
Important to keep your audience


928
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:27,006
in mind here too, in terms of


929
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:28,806
what kind of vocabulary you're


930
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,296
using in these method names.


931
00:27:30,636 --> 00:27:31,926
Your word choice is just as


932
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:33,446
important as the concepts you're


933
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:36,576
leading them through.


934
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:39,256
And, finally, please provide


935
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:40,446
common keywords.


936
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,836
We all love autocomplete.


937
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:44,706
Your learner will love it if


938
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,486
they can just tap "func", tap


939
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:48,286
"var", tap "if" to put it in


940
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:48,456
there.


941
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,716
Don't make them type those over


942
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:51,226
and over.


943
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:52,496
You want to focus on the


944
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,666
learning, and one of the most


945
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,346
important things about focusing


946
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,326
on the learning is not having


947
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,876
ancillary busyness going on in


948
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:01,586
your mind of remembering, was it


949
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:03,366
"func" with a capital F, does


950
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:04,816
the "var"-- do I need a space


951
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,336
before and after the equals?


952
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,516
Things like that.


953
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:08,766
You don't want to have to deal


954
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:09,616
with that, and your learner


955
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:10,156
doesn't either.


956
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:12,766
So, just provide these helpful


957
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,766
things in the shortcut bar, and


958
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:15,746
your learner will be able to


959
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:17,246
focus on what you really want to


960
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:18,386
teach them, and that's what


961
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:18,766
matters.


962
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:21,476
So, we've talked about the


963
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:22,426
learner, a lot.


964
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:25,156
And, that brings us to the


965
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:26,806
second overarching point.


966
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,456
Who is your learner?


967
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:30,106
Are they a beginner?


968
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:31,616
Are they advanced?


969
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:33,756
Are you writing a computational


970
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:35,566
biology playground, and showing


971
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:36,436
it to biologists?


972
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:37,896
Or, showing it to computer


973
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:38,556
scientists?


974
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:40,566
Those people are going to bring


975
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:42,146
totally different backgrounds


976
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:43,276
and experience levels.


977
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:44,666
And, you really need to get to


978
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,496
know your learner and understand


979
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:47,856
where they're coming from to


980
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,746
provide them the best, richest,


981
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,056
most supportive learning


982
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:51,666
experience.


983
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,386
I'm going to walk you through


984
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:56,596
some examples now, of pages from


985
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:58,376
our playground books where we


986
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:00,296
had goals in mind, but we also


987
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:01,506
had to keep our audience


988
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:02,966
strongly in the forefront.


989
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,626
This is a page from Learn to


990
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:09,716
Code 3, where we're asking the


991
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:11,236
learner to add a background


992
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:12,356
image to the screen.


993
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,996
We say it right there.


994
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,006
Set a background image.


995
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:17,876
Add it to the screen.


996
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,946
And, that's because this is


997
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:21,146
targeted at a beginner.


998
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:23,846
Complete a task-style goal, like


999
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,396
we talked about from before, and


1000
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,386
beginner audience.


1001
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,336
Set a background image, alright,


1002
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,156
I'm primed.


1003
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:33,346
And now, right here, this is how


1004
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:33,816
you do it.


1005
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,346
scene.backgroundImage equals


1006
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,216
"image literal."


1007
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,216
I give the learner the syntax,


1008
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:40,946
because, again, this is targeted


1009
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,606
at a beginner who's not going to


1010
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,196
have all that far-reaching


1011
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:45,966
computer science knowledge, not


1012
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,106
even that far-reaching.


1013
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:48,326
To us, this seems simple.


1014
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:49,236
Everyone knows that


1015
00:29:49,236 --> 00:29:50,696
"backgroundImage" is the name of


1016
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:51,366
that property.


1017
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:52,726
But a beginner doesn't.


1018
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,526
And since we're all content


1019
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,526
matter experts, it's really hard


1020
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,296
to put ourselves in the shoes of


1021
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,946
a beginner who isn't familiar


1022
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:00,606
with the syntax.


1023
00:30:01,476 --> 00:30:02,996
That's why user testing is so


1024
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:03,616
important.


1025
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:04,796
To figure out what kind of


1026
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,486
logical leaps you're making,


1027
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:08,036
that your learner needs to be


1028
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:09,416
walked through a little more


1029
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:09,946
slowly.


1030
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:13,276
We then give them extremely


1031
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:14,526
explicit instructions.


1032
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,186
Write the syntax we just gave


1033
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:19,206
you, and then choose "image


1034
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:20,526
literal" from the shortcut bar.


1035
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:21,966
Again, we're offering them the


1036
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,176
appropriate shortcuts in the


1037
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:24,666
bar, and then choose a


1038
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,416
background image.


1039
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:27,536
By now, you are probably all,


1040
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,316
like, I know, background image,


1041
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:30,566
I'm good, move on.


1042
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:32,166
But, a beginner needs this


1043
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:32,626
support.


1044
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:35,096
Finally, we even offer a


1045
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:35,466
comment.


1046
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:37,126
This is where you do it, this is


1047
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,216
where you write the code.


1048
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:39,716
Set background image.


1049
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:44,656
Let's take a look at a page with


1050
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,376
a similar goal, completing a


1051
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,296
task, but with a totally


1052
00:30:48,296 --> 00:30:49,636
different audience in mind.


1053
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:52,676
These are your advanced


1054
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:53,266
learners.


1055
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:56,286
We still have a goal statement,


1056
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:58,116
but it's far more broad.


1057
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,036
Use a breadth-first search


1058
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:02,056
algorithm to complete the maze.


1059
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,076
There are any number of ways


1060
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,146
that I could complete this.


1061
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:06,466
And, I have to have a lot of


1062
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:07,876
knowledge in my brain already to


1063
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:09,316
even understand what that goal


1064
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:10,726
statement means.


1065
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,916
We still offer instructions, but


1066
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,396
again, they're more broad, more


1067
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:18,086
open-ended.


1068
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:20,846
Start by adding all the tiles to


1069
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:21,506
the queue.


1070
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,626
Pop those tiles.


1071
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:27,946
And there you go.


1072
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:32,226
And then, in the user code


1073
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,296
section, we just offer an empty


1074
00:31:34,296 --> 00:31:37,166
function and ask the user to use


1075
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,616
their knowledge that they


1076
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,076
already have, that we've taught


1077
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,776
them a little bit of, to do


1078
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:42,036
this.


1079
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:44,636
Totally open-ended, overwhelming


1080
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,126
for a beginner, but for an


1081
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,006
advanced learner, they know what


1082
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:48,476
to do.


1083
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:49,736
They know how to complete this


1084
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,666
task, and move on with the page.


1085
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,136
What about a different style of


1086
00:31:57,196 --> 00:31:57,686
page?


1087
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,506
Thinking about a concept.


1088
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:04,276
In this one, we introduce Blink,


1089
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,226
related to Conway's Game of


1090
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:07,876
Life, which is essentially a


1091
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,696
cell simulator, where cells live


1092
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,126
and die depending on how many


1093
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:12,756
neighbors they have around them.


1094
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:14,736
It's a pretty complicated idea,


1095
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:16,576
that can be broken down into


1096
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:17,296
simple rules.


1097
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:19,816
We give the learner a fair


1098
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:20,946
amount of text here, because


1099
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:22,086
we're introducing something


1100
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:22,626
totally new.


1101
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:24,666
And, that's part of our job, is


1102
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,696
to explain that in detail, for


1103
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:27,636
those who are interested.


1104
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:31,126
We do have a goal statement, but


1105
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:33,556
it's embedded, and the goal is


1106
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:35,186
just to really understand these


1107
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,376
algorithms, to think.


1108
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,416
There's no clear end point, no


1109
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,886
time where the page tells you


1110
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:41,876
you're ready to move on.


1111
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,156
It's up to you, to understand


1112
00:32:44,156 --> 00:32:45,776
this, play around with the live


1113
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:47,616
view, which you'll see in a


1114
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:48,676
minute.


1115
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:49,956
And, understand when you're


1116
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:50,936
ready, as the learner.


1117
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,796
We still offer this sort of


1118
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:56,866
tl;dr version in the middle.


1119
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:58,206
If you didn't want to read all


1120
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:00,016
that prose at the top, here are


1121
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:01,336
the rules of the simulation.


1122
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,546
You can kind of get where you're


1123
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:03,416
going with these.


1124
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,026
So, it's somewhat similar


1125
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,596
structure to completing a task,


1126
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:08,426
but a totally different learner


1127
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:10,066
goal, and author goal.


1128
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:15,886
And then, finally, we have, kind


1129
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:17,516
of instructions, at the bottom.


1130
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:19,026
They're embedded, again.


1131
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:21,346
Experiment with stepping through


1132
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:22,706
the simulation, which we've


1133
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:24,166
provided on the live view side.


1134
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:26,706
Try it out, and then when you're


1135
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:28,656
ready, go on to the next page to


1136
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:29,796
explore what you'll be doing


1137
00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:31,716
with it.


1138
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,986
What's the audience of this


1139
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:33,556
page?


1140
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:35,656
Is it advanced?


1141
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:39,266
Beginner? Are they science


1142
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:39,796
students?


1143
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:40,966
Are they artists?


1144
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:42,866
The way you're going to figure


1145
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,326
that out is, you have your


1146
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,046
target audience in mind, and


1147
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,536
then you need to do user


1148
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:48,206
testing.


1149
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:49,986
Find out if this is too


1150
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,116
complicated for them.


1151
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:52,946
Figure out what words need to be


1152
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:54,896
defined, what concepts need to


1153
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:56,766
be explained more, or perhaps


1154
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:56,916
less.


1155
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:58,706
Don't underestimate your


1156
00:33:58,706 --> 00:33:58,976
audience either.


1157
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,376
Is it coding time yet?


1158
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,366
We've got all these ideas, we


1159
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:12,376
understand the goal, the


1160
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:13,106
audience.


1161
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:14,476
We know all the parts of the


1162
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:15,896
playground page, backward and


1163
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:16,426
forward.


1164
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:18,706
Surely, it must be coding time


1165
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:19,116
now.


1166
00:34:19,706 --> 00:34:23,906
Not yet. I've moved from my


1167
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,436
little notebook to my


1168
00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:27,146
whiteboard, but that's it.


1169
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:29,596
I have expanded my ideas


1170
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:29,976
somewhat.


1171
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:33,606
I have some prose written down,


1172
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:35,476
I have the coding section, I


1173
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:36,795
have transitions.


1174
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:39,255
Also, in this format, I can talk


1175
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:40,806
to some of my co-workers in the


1176
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:40,996
office.


1177
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,045
Hey, Alex, does this make any


1178
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:43,626
sense to you?


1179
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:45,416
What do you think?


1180
00:34:45,646 --> 00:34:46,876
Is this a cool idea, Bill?


1181
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,626
Would your kids like this?


1182
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:50,936
It's really important to get


1183
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:53,016
feedback from your actual users,


1184
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:54,596
and from your colleagues, your


1185
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:55,116
peers.


1186
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:57,085
This is your prototyping phase,


1187
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:58,846
to figure out what works and


1188
00:34:58,846 --> 00:34:59,366
what doesn't.


1189
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:01,886
So, no, it is not coding time


1190
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:01,976
yet.


1191
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:09,336
So, we've talked through goal


1192
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:11,126
and audience, and it's time to


1193
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:12,806
talk about passion.


1194
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:15,296
Passion is so important.


1195
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:17,556
This should be threaded


1196
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:18,736
throughout all your other


1197
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:20,136
playground prototyping and


1198
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:20,696
thinking.


1199
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,646
Why are you even doing this?


1200
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:23,506
Why are you writing a


1201
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:24,176
playground?


1202
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:25,976
It's because you're passionate


1203
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:27,076
about something that you want to


1204
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,676
share, that you want to teach to


1205
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:29,316
someone else.


1206
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:31,946
If you're not passionate about


1207
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,026
what you're writing a playground


1208
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,396
about, why are you doing it?


1209
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:37,966
And that, that not passion is


1210
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,406
going to show through, and your


1211
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,766
learner's not care either.


1212
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:42,696
So, bringing your passion to


1213
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,246
this is so important.


1214
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,536
How can you do this?


1215
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:49,436
Well, let's take a look at the


1216
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:50,136
live view.


1217
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,156
I said this before, this is


1218
00:35:53,156 --> 00:35:54,656
where the learner is going to


1219
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,586
get to experience their code


1220
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:57,106
running.


1221
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:58,686
This is where they're going to


1222
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,196
get excited about creating,


1223
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:01,436
about what they've made.


1224
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,406
So, this is your chance to make


1225
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:05,056
that experience as visually


1226
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:07,026
exciting, as auditorily


1227
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,676
exciting, as exciting period,


1228
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:10,826
for your users.


1229
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:13,106
Here's Learn to Code, where we


1230
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:14,506
have this adorable character,


1231
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:16,616
this cool, game-style world.


1232
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,546
This appeals to a lot of people.


1233
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:20,896
Gets them excited about jumping


1234
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:21,866
into this world and writing


1235
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:21,956
code.


1236
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:26,356
Here's another example of


1237
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:26,946
spirals.


1238
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:29,966
I had so much fun working on


1239
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:31,196
this, I would get totally


1240
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:33,096
distracted trying to de-bug by


1241
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,906
just creating cool new spirals


1242
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:36,166
and modifying variables.


1243
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:37,976
That's a great sign.


1244
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:40,216
If you enjoy going through the


1245
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:42,426
tasks in your playground book,


1246
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:44,956
your learners probably will too.


1247
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:46,076
And, on the other hand, if


1248
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:47,716
you're bored by the exercises,


1249
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:48,986
if you wonder why you're


1250
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:51,106
teaching this, how are you going


1251
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:52,316
to get your learner motivated to


1252
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,106
go through them either?


1253
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,156
You have to be excited about


1254
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:56,696
what you're doing, to bring your


1255
00:36:56,696 --> 00:36:58,016
passion to those views.


1256
00:36:58,386 --> 00:37:00,786
Here's another cool example,


1257
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:01,976
totally different style.


1258
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:03,676
This is, Blink.


1259
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:05,666
From that page of text you saw


1260
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:06,166
earlier.


1261
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,076
We have all that text, but we


1262
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:09,206
also have this rich,


1263
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,356
interactive, live view on the


1264
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:12,856
right hand side, where the


1265
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,686
learner can play with the


1266
00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:15,136
algorithm, they can use touch


1267
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,146
gestures to interact with it.


1268
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,866
This is the place where passion


1269
00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:20,976
can really shine.


1270
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:30,856
So. We have the marriage of


1271
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:32,746
teaching that Bill talked to you


1272
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:35,356
about, and designing that I


1273
00:37:35,356 --> 00:37:36,176
talked to you about.


1274
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:39,186
It's so important to keep these


1275
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:40,706
in mind, the teaching aspect,


1276
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:41,536
what you're trying to get


1277
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:44,186
across, and how you're designing


1278
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:44,326
it.


1279
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:45,766
How you're prototyping it.


1280

Who you're talking to for help,


1281
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:49,286
how often you're user testing.


1282
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:53,026
With these two-- when these


1283
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:55,346
powers combine, we are Captain


1284
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:56,266
Amazing Teacher.


1285
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:03,526
So. Get ready for it.


1286
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:04,836
Coding time.

[ Applause ]


1288
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:13,896
Once you have your prototype, or


1289
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,546
excuse me, storyboard figured


1290
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:15,876
out.


1291
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,756
Once you've solicited feedback,


1292
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,846
talked to your users, talked to


1293
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,016
whoever wanted you to make this


1294
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,176
playground in the first place,


1295
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,096
if it wasn't you.


1296
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:24,536
You've gotten all those things


1297
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,996
together, you know what you want


1298
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:27,566
your hints to be, you know what


1299
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:28,776
you want your success messages


1300
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:29,796
to be, how you're going to


1301
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:30,996
assist your learner in all the


1302
00:38:30,996 --> 00:38:31,816
best ways.


1303
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:33,946
You've got a storyboard, now it


1304
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:35,306
is time for you to write code,


1305
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,936
and make that awesome playground


1306
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:38,316
idea a reality.


1307
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,196
And, you don't need me to teach


1308
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:43,116
you how to code.


1309
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,906
So, you can probably all say it


1310
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,876
with me now at this point, but


1311
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,606
the three things to take away


1312
00:38:49,606 --> 00:38:53,276
from this presentation are goal,


1313
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:59,546
audience, and passion.


1314
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:00,766
That's right.


1315
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:03,286
And so, with those things in


1316
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:05,506
mind, I say to you all, go


1317
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:06,976
forth, and teach.
