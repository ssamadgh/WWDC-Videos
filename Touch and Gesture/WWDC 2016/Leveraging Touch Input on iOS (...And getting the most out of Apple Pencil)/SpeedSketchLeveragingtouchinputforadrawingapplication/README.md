# SpeedSketch: Leveraging touch input for a drawing application

This sample demonstrates how to capture touch input on iOS into a series of strokes and rendering them in a fast, efficient and correct way on a Canvas. It shows how to get the highest fidelity and best latency when using Apple Pencil. It also touches on subclassing of UIGestureRecognizer, and on how to coordinate gestures between pencil and touches.
