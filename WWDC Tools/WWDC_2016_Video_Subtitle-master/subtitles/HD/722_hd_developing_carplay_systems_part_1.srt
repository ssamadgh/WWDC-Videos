2
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,516
>> Hello, and welcome
to our first session


3
00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:24,096
on developing CarPlay Systems.


4
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:26,296
My name is Emily,
and I'm responsible


5
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:28,186
for Car Experience
engineering at Apple.


6
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:32,526
CarPlay was designed from
the ground up as a smarter,


7
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,766
safer way to use your
iPhone in the car.


8
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,176
CarPlay takes the
things you want to do


9
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:39,636
with your iPhone while
driving, and puts them right


10
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,016
on your car's built-in display.


11
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:44,436
CarPlay brings the
familiar elements


12
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:47,376
and interaction patterns
of iPhone into your car.


13
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:50,366
Users already know how
to do things in CarPlay


14
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:52,006
because they know how
to use their iPhone.


15
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:56,606
CarPlay is about more
than just showing iOS


16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,936
on the car's display.


17
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,126
CarPlay is thoughtfully
integrated


18
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,836
with your car's built-in system


19
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,786
to deliver the best
possible user experience.


20
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,116
CarPlay allows you to
design for the future.


21
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,426
With CarPlay, you can
build a car today,


22
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:14,306
and when Apple introduces
new versions of iOS,


23
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:17,486
users will immediately
benefit from new features.


24
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:21,086
Your car will remain fresh
for years into the future.


25
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:25,806
Today we'll give you an overview


26
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:27,536
of how the CarPlay
feature works,


27
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:30,036
and discuss the most
important requirements


28
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:30,906
for you to consider.


29
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,106
We'll explain the user
experience that we want


30
00:01:34,106 --> 00:01:36,886
to enable with CarPlay
and the design guidelines


31
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:37,616
that we've provided.


32
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:44,146
At the end, we'll talk about
CarPlay supported apps.


33
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,636
IPhone user interface is
designed to work perfectly


34
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,066
when held in the hand, when
you can touch the phone.


35
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:53,776
CarPlay translates that
user interface to the car,


36
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:57,286
making it appropriate in that
setting, and safer to use.


37
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:01,526
It works with what you
already have in your vehicle.


38
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,936
It's comfortable to use
in that environment.


39
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:09,645
Now let's talk about how
CarPlay works in detail.


40
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:14,546
Let's start with the native
user interface of the vehicle.


41
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:21,976
When an iPhone is plugged in,
the CarPlay session begins.


42
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,956
When a CarPlay session
is brought up,


43
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,376
information is sent
both directions via


44
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,116
communication protocols.


45
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,846
Video can be sent
from the iPhone


46
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:35,786
to the car as well as audio.


47
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:41,266
Audio can also be sent from the
car's microphone to the iPhone.


48
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:45,436
Once a CarPlay session
is established,


49
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,386
different combinations of
these data streams are used.


50
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:53,006
When a CarPlay Home
screen is first shown,


51
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,196
and no audio is playing, the
communication protocols are used


52
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:58,166
for setup and location
information.


53
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:02,246
An H264 video stream showing
the Home screen is sent


54
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,636
from the iPhone to the car.


55
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,166
If we then play audio
in CarPlay,


56
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:10,986
the communication protocols
will additionally be used


57
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:12,776
to send information
about the playing track.


58
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:17,126
The video stream here is
encoding the now playing screen,


59
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,846
and audio for the song
is sent to the car.


60
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:26,086
If the CarPlay UI is exited,
and the car's screen is shown,


61
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,756
the CarPlay session
remains active.


62
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,366
The communication protocols
will continue to be used


63
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,646
for now playing and
location information.


64
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,316
The video stream is
no longer needed,


65
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:39,516
but CarPlay audio still plays,


66
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,506
even though CarPlay
video is not shown.


67
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:46,076
The screen and audio are
controlled independently.


68
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:50,606
Video from the native system
can be shown while CarPlay audio


69
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,216
is playing.


70
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:53,926
If the CarPlay interface
were shown,


71
00:03:54,376 --> 00:04:00,186
audio from the native system,
like FM radio, could play.


72
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:04,156
Let's see what happens if Siri
is then launched using the


73
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,846
push-to-talk steering
wheel button.


74
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:09,956
The communication protocols will
be used to tell the head unit


75
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,416
that iOS voice recognition
is underway.


76
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:15,596
The CarPlay UI is
sent to the screen,


77
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:18,696
and the Siri audio chime plays
on the vehicle's speakers.


78
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,826
In this case, audio is also sent


79
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,836
from the car's microphones
to the iPhone.


80
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:29,996
These examples gave you
a high-level overview


81
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,416
of how CarPlay works.


82
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,286
Now let's look in more detail


83
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:37,666
at what's happening
in the head unit.


84
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:42,566
For wired CarPlay,
data goes over USB.


85
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,776
All data is wrapped in IP.


86
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:50,456
Except for the iAP2
communication protocol.


87
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:57,696
Information from vehicle sensors
is sent over iAP2 as is audio,


88
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,076
telephony, and turn-by-turn
metadata.


89
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:05,036
The communication plug-in is
source code provided by Apple,


90
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,986
and that receives the incoming
video and audio streams as well


91
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,056
as an additional
communication stream.


92
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:16,086
The audio and video is sent to
the head unit's infrastructure,


93
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:19,456
connected to the speakers,
microphone, and display.


94
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:25,166
Control events from the
touchscreen, knob, buttons,


95
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,846
or touchpad are sent
to the plug-in.


96
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:32,396
Now in the case of
wireless CarPlay,


97
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:34,306
much of the system
looks the same.


98
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,966
Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
are needed.


99
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,956
For wireless, all
data is wrapped in IP.


100
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:46,276
Connections to the vehicle's
subsystems are the same.


101
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,976
Now that you have a
good understanding


102
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,426
of how CarPlay works, we'll go


103
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,666
over the most important
vehicle requirements.


104
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:58,266
We will talk through
each of these in detail.


105
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,326
We want to make sure you
understand the requirements


106
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:04,576
before you begin to design a
system so that you can be sure


107
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:06,876
that it's capable of
supporting CarPlay.


108
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,776
First, the vehicle
needs a great display.


109
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:14,446
A high-quality display
is critical


110
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,816
to the CarPlay experience.


111
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,606
Several standard display
resolutions are supported,


112
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:25,476
and those resolutions
are shown here.


113
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,166
Most are approximately 16 by 9.


114
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,426
Extra-wide screens
are also supported.


115
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:35,916
Today, all supported resolutions
are landscape orientation.


116
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,926
We have support for screens
with varying pixel densities.


117
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:46,146
Asset sizes in CarPlay have
been adjusted depending


118
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:48,006
on the resolution of the screen.


119
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:51,706
So that assets will
appear the same size on low


120
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:53,236
and high resolution screens.


121
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:58,196
Without this, icons on the 720
screens would be much smaller.


122
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,986
If you do have a display with
a slightly different resolution


123
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:07,006
than what was listed here,
please contact Apple to see


124
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,106
if it can be supported.


125
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:12,126
We require that aftermarket
screens be no smaller


126
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:13,086
than six inches


127
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,736
since aftermarket
systems could be installed


128
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:17,846
into a wide variety of vehicles.


129
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,626
There is no minimum for
systems built by automakers.


130
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,526
The automaker has the
responsibility to make sure


131
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,506
that CarPlay is appropriate on
the selected vehicle screen.


132
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:32,986
I should mention several
additional screen requirements.


133
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,496
Twenty-four bit color
depth is required,


134
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,426
and a 60 hertz refresh rate
is strongly recommended


135
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,696
for a responsive user interface.


136
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:45,816
Make sure that your H264 decoder
supports the right profile.


137
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,886
This is a hard requirement.


138
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:53,466
A high-quality display in
the vehicle is critical


139
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,036
to the CarPlay experience.


140
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:58,906
Let's talk about the car's
audio system and microphones.


141
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,156
CarPlay audio is separated


142
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:05,846
into two streams main
audio and alternate audio.


143
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,926
Main audio is bi-directional,
and it is used for music


144
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,416
and other media plus
phone calls and Siri.


145
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,016
Alternate audio is
used for notifications,


146
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:20,686
and it must always be mixed by
the head unit with main audio.


147
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:24,676
If the head unit is playing
audio, like FM radio,


148
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,046
the head unit must
mix alternate audio


149
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:29,036
from iPhone with that audio.


150
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,916
LPCM is used for wired CarPlay.


151
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:37,326
Wireless CarPlay
requires compressed audio.


152
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:42,246
AAC-LC is used for media, and
you have a choice between OPUS


153
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,636
and AAC-ELD for other audio.


154
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:52,886
CarPlay supports the
various user input devices


155
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:53,786
in your vehicles.


156
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:58,126
The CarPlay UI can be
controlled by a touchscreen


157
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:02,106
on the head unit, by knobs
and buttons, or by a touchpad.


158
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:06,196
The Siri button on the steering
wheel is also a critical user


159
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:07,336
input device.


160
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,456
Many vehicles have touchscreens,


161
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:12,976
and let's talk about
those first.


162
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:18,556
When the CarPlay UI is active,
and the user touches the screen,


163
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:21,246
the head unit sends
the iPhone the x,


164
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:22,906
y coordinates of that touch.


165
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:26,616
The head unit sends all
touches to the iPhone


166
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,526
when CarPlay is displayed
on the screen.


167
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,786
CarPlay is controlled
with single touches only.


168
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,736
We support two types
of touchscreens,


169
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:37,806
what we call high-fidelity
and low-fidelity.


170
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:42,426
High-fidelity touch
systems have low latency.


171
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,836
So swipe gestures that track
the user's finger are allowed.


172
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,516
A high-performance system
is required, however,


173
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:55,846
one that has less than 140
milliseconds touch latency.


174
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:00,706
This is how list scrolling
using a swipe gesture


175
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,776
that tracks the touch
input works


176
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,586
with a high-fidelity
touch system.


177
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:12,156
Low-fidelity touchscreens
may have higher latency


178
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:14,076
and are often resistive screens.


179
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:18,136
Taps control the UI, and
a swipe will not track the


180
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,206
user's finger.


181
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:24,386
This is how list scrolling
with single taps works


182
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:26,226
with a low-fidelity
touch system.


183
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:36,326
Some vehicles use knob,
button, and touchpad controls.


184
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,086
Sometimes these are the
main user input devices,


185
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,756
and sometimes they are
secondary to a touchscreen.


186
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:44,616
All combinations are
supported by CarPlay.


187
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:50,406
Knobs are supported by the
head unit, sending rotate,


188
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:58,286
select, and back events.


189
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:04,286
This is the minimum set
of supported features


190
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,706
for a knob that's used
as a primary interface.


191
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,106
Rotate, select, and back.


192
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,646
Some knobs also support
a tilt or nudge feature.


193
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,146
This capability is
supported by the CarPlay UI.


194
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:30,436
Vehicle touchpads report
x, y coordinates as well


195
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:35,056
as select and a back button.


196
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,516
If a knob or touchpad
controller is primary,


197
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:43,706
back and select are required.


198
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:48,036
Secondary touchpads can also
support character recognition.


199
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:52,146
Buttons for various functions
such as next, previous,


200
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:54,256
and telephony functions
are optional.


201
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:58,726
The CarPlay UI will
automatically change


202
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,506
to match the user inputs
available in the vehicle.


203
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,816
All combinations are possible.


204
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,856
If the main controller
interface is touchscreen,


205
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,086
then combinations
with a knob, touchpad,


206
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:12,396
or knob plus touchpad
are also possible.


207
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,826
A hard button for
Siri is required.


208
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,216
Siri is really important
to the CarPlay experience.


209
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:25,596
The user needs a quick way
to always access Siri even


210
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:27,736
if the CarPlay UI isn't showing.


211
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,146
Usually this requirement
is satisfied


212
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:32,416
with a push-to-talk button
on the steering wheel.


213
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,906
For the Siri button, we require


214
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:38,256
that the head unit send iPhone
all button up/down events


215
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:41,846
so that interaction during the
Siri conversation is possible.


216
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:46,166
This wraps up our
discussion on user inputs.


217
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,396
Sensor information is
important to CarPlay.


218
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:57,456
CarPlay needs location
information from the vehicle


219
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,676
so that the map's
app works well.


220
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:03,186
Speed and GNSS information
can be provided.


221
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,956
Every vehicle needs
to know its speed.


222
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:09,256
Speed information is used
by iPhone for dead reckoning


223
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:13,056
and is critical if the
vehicle does not have a GPS


224
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,226
or GLONASS receiver.


225
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:18,086
GNSS information includes
latitude and longitude


226
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,196
if the vehicle has
that capability.


227
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:26,296
Satellite location information
from the vehicle is used


228
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,196
in addition to the
iPhone's sensors


229
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,446
to determine the
location of the user.


230
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,296
This data from the
vehicle may be better


231
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,056
since a larger antenna can
be integrated into the car.


232
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,796
This is the recommended
configuration


233
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:42,506
since it will result in the
best maps user experience.


234
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,276
Sending satellite
location information


235
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:46,706
to iPhone is required


236
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,206
if the vehicle has the
technology on board.


237
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,836
GNSS information
is also required


238
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,626
for any system supporting
wireless CarPlay


239
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:59,406
since it's more likely that the
phone will be in a pocket, bag,


240
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,166
or somewhere where the phone
itself has poor reception.


241
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,136
What are the requirements


242
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,336
for connecting an
iPhone to the head unit?


243
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:15,486
Apple CarPlay supports both
wired and wireless connections.


244
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:18,476
We're excited about the
addition of wireless CarPlay


245
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,876
since it offers a very
convenient experience


246
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:21,596
for customers.


247
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:25,096
Users can leave their
phones in pockets and bags,


248
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:27,626
which is especially
nice on a short drive.


249
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,696
Let's first talk about
wired connections.


250
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:36,836
USB is used here,
and all audio, video,


251
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,706
and control information
is sent over USB.


252
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:43,276
Your head unit will need
to support a USB role swap.


253
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:47,016
The head unit will switch from
a USB host to a USB device.


254
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:50,046
High throughput is a
requirement, and you'll want


255
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:53,106
to make sure your USB
infrastructure can support the


256
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,326
required data rates.


257
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:57,276
If you have multiple USB
ports in the vehicle,


258
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,496
and not all of them
support CarPlay,


259
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,566
you'll need to properly
label the ports.


260
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,586
Wireless CarPlay is
supported in iOS 9.


261
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,856
Both Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi are required.


262
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:17,196
Bluetooth is used for discovery
and the initial connection.


263
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,886
Once the Wi-Fi credentials
are sent to the iPhone


264
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:26,356
over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
is connected,


265
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,156
Bluetooth is disconnected,


266
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,986
and all subsequent CarPlay
communication is over Wi-Fi.


267
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,186
During the CarPlay
session, all audio,


268
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:40,956
including phone call audio and
video, is transmitted over Wi-Fi


269
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,876
as well as the control protocol.


270
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:48,836
CarPlay requires a
Wi-Fi certified AP,


271
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:51,346
and 5 gigahertz is recommended.


272
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,216
Note that high throughput,


273
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:56,086
25 megabits per second,
is required.


274
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:58,446
The Bluetooth subsystem needs


275
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,566
to support the communication
protocol.


276
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:05,106
Wireless CarPlay offers a
convenient comfortable user


277
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:06,686
experience, and we're excited


278
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,546
to see your vehicles
that support it.


279
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,636
Now let's hear from Donald about
the CarPlay Design Guidelines.


280
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,976
>> Hi. My name is Donald, and
I work on design at Apple.


281
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:19,586
Now that you've seen
how CarPlay works,


282
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:21,646
let's look at some
design guidelines


283
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,616
that will help you provide
the best CarPlay experience


284
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,276
in your cars.


285
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,206
One of the most important
things to keep in mind is


286
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,716
that CarPlay is really designed
to use the entire display.


287
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,646
CarPlay is instantly
familiar to iPhone users,


288
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:39,896
and they feel comfortable
with it


289
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:42,396
because it's a consistent
environment with its own icons,


290
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:45,216
visual language, and system
of internal navigation.


291
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,086
Every interaction with
CarPlay is easier and faster


292
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,456
when users can trust
that everything


293
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,876
on the screen is
part of CarPlay.


294
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,856
If a user has to discern which
elements are part of CarPlay


295
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:02,116
and which elements are part
of your car's user interface,


296
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,486
then every interaction
becomes more challenging.


297
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,715
Also, your car's native user
interface may include icons


298
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:12,356
that resemble or have
similar functions


299
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:13,546
to icons within CarPlay.


300
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:16,726
And it can be confusing
if these icons are


301
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:17,976
on the display at the same time.


302
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:25,116
Instead, use the entire
display to show CarPlay.


303
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:32,546
Let's take a look at what should
happen when CarPlay starts.


304
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,956
CarPlay always starts the moment
iPhone is plugged into your car.


305
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,346
Users should never have to
think about how to start it.


306
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,486
When the user connects
their iPhone to your car


307
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:48,636
for the first time, the
car's display should switch


308
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:49,756
to show CarPlay right away.


309
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,656
This provides feedback
that CarPlay is started


310
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:58,246
and creates a strong association
between the act of connecting


311
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,666
and the familiar
appearance of CarPlay.


312
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:05,586
Don't show notifications


313
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,466
to announce state changes
related to CarPlay.


314
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,046
The needed appearance of CarPlay


315
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,326
in the display is the most
effective visual feedback.


316
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:16,686
Now let's consider
what should happen


317
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,146
after the initial
CarPlay connection.


318
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,476
When users connect their iPhone
a second time, it should feel


319
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,276
like a continuation of
their previous session.


320
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,626
So if CarPlay was
showing on the display


321
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:31,016
when the user left the car,
CarPlay should be shown again


322
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:32,046
when iPhone is connected.


323
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,906
And if CarPlay media
was being played


324
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,626
when the user left the car,
CarPlay media should resume


325
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,826
when iPhone is reconnected
as long


326
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:42,826
as the user did not select
a different audio source


327
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,166
between their CarPlay
connections.


328
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:47,256
In other words, we want


329
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,226
to always respect the last
selection the user made


330
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:49,676
in the car.


331
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:55,906
Let's see how last
user mode should work.


332
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:57,876
Notice that I'm using CarPlay,


333
00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:59,396
and it's showing on
the car's display.


334
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:04,736
Now if I disconnect, CarPlay
ends, and the car falls back


335
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,006
to its native user interface.


336
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:10,376
If I plug in again, CarPlay
should appear on the display


337
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:12,216
because that was the last
thing I was doing in the car.


338
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,766
So if CarPlay was the
last thing on the display


339
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,436
when it was disconnected,
or the car was turned off,


340
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,696
CarPlay should be shown when
iPhone is connected again.


341
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:27,706
If CarPlay media was playing,
CarPlay media should play again.


342
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:33,606
Let's see a different example.


343
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,366
This time, CarPlay is active


344
00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:37,826
with the car's display showing
the native user interface.


345
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:42,076
Now if I disconnect
and then plug in again,


346
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,806
CarPlay does not
appear on the display


347
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:47,546
because the native user
interface was the last thing I


348
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:48,496
was using in the car.


349
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:55,526
So if CarPlay was not the last
thing shown, it should remain


350
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:56,816
in the car's user interface.


351
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:00,166
But even if CarPlay was not
the last thing on the screen,


352
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,976
if CarPlay media was playing,
CarPlay media should play again.


353
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,946
CarPlay is available the moment
the user plugs in their iPhone,


354
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:12,856
but they can switch
between the CarPlay display


355
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:14,716
and the native user
interface at any time.


356
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:18,526
As we saw earlier,
the user returns


357
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:21,226
to the car's user interface
by selecting your brand's icon


358
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:22,266
in the CarPlay Home screen.


359
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,516
They can switch back to CarPlay


360
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,996
by using the Apple
CarPlay button.


361
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,466
The Apple CarPlay button is
the most important indication


362
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,566
that CarPlay is available.


363
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,276
As soon as CarPlay starts,


364
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,576
the Apple CarPlay
button must become active


365
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:39,566
in your top level menu.


366
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:45,966
And the Apple CarPlay must only
appear when iPhone is connected


367
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,036
and CarPlay is active.


368
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,796
Be sure to hide the
Apple CarPlay button


369
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:53,966
when iPhone is disconnected.


370
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,686
And they also show the
Apple CarPlay button


371
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,716
in an enabled state
when CarPlay is active


372
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:06,486
and in a disabled state
when CarPlay is inactive.


373
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:13,546
You can optionally replace an
existing button the top level


374
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:16,756
menu with the Apple CarPlay
button such as a phone button.


375
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,976
Just remember that the Apple
CarPlay button must appear


376
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:25,366
on your car's Home screen
whenever iPhone is connected.


377
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,166
When iPhone is disconnected,


378
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:30,156
the Apple CarPlay button must
disappear or be disabled.


379
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:35,496
Let's talk about the
Apple CarPlay button


380
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,186
that should appear
in your interface.


381
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:41,996
There are a variety of approved
Apple CarPlay logos available


382
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:44,486
to use as buttons in your
car's native user interface.


383
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:47,256
Choose the one that makes the
most sense with your design.


384
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:54,106
There's a black logo and a
white logo as well as white


385
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:55,616
and black variance
with backgrounds.


386
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:59,566
And, finally, there's
a color background.


387
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,346
Let's talk about how
media sources are handled


388
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:09,586
when iPhone is disconnected.


389
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:13,646
Let's say that CarPlay
is active,


390
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,836
and the user is listening
to CarPlay audio playback.


391
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:20,856
When iPhone is disconnected,
it's a strong indication


392
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,026
that they're about
to leave the car.


393
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:25,256
Your system should
gracefully handle CarPlay media


394
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,156
being disconnected.


395
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:31,966
When iPhone is disconnected,
the user should hear silence


396
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:34,606
and audio should not fall
back to another audio source.


397
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:39,596
If the iPhone is disconnected
while CarPlay is displayed


398
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:41,906
on the car's display, you
should gracefully fall back


399
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:44,326
to the last screen displayed
before entering CarPlay.


400
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:48,506
Don't show a CarPlay unavailable
or device disconnected screen.


401
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:55,376
So, again, when CarPlay
media is playing,


402
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,596
and the user disconnects iPhone,
they should just hear silence.


403
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:04,226
The hardware buttons in
your car should also be used


404
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:05,106
to support CarPlay.


405
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:10,546
Siri is an integral
part of CarPlay


406
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:12,486
and requires a dedicated
tactile button.


407
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,766
Because it's so important,
the button should be


408
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:16,956
on the car steering wheel.


409
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,426
Users expected Siri to
work at any time, whether


410
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:21,906
or not CarPlay is currently
visible on the car's display.


411
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:24,976
They also expect the
Siri button to work


412
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,236
like the Home button on iPhone.


413
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:29,656
Pressing and holding it for 600
milliseconds should activate


414
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:32,496
Siri, and the activation
delay must not be greater


415
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,206
than one second.


416
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:38,056
The media buttons in your
car should be connected


417
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:40,636
to CarPlay media playback
so users can play, pause,


418
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,576
move to the next track
or previous track,


419
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:43,876
and fast forward and rewind.


420
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:50,516
Finally, if your car has
shortcut buttons for phone,


421
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:53,066
media, or navigation,
they should also be mapped


422
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:54,576
to the respective
apps within CarPlay.


423
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:01,656
>> Now let's talk about
apps that work in CarPlay.


424
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:06,696
Apps supported by
CarPlay will appear


425
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,706
on the CarPlay Home
screen in the vehicle.


426
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,416
Three categories of
apps are supported.


427
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,956
Audio, those specific


428
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:17,766
to particular vehicles,
and messaging apps.


429
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,216
If a user has an audio app
that's been updated for CarPlay,


430
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:23,756
that app will appear


431
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:26,576
in any CarPlay car
the user connects to.


432
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:30,386
The user interface for
these apps is fixed


433
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,256
with the structure
provided by iOS


434
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:35,206
and the content provided
by the app itself.


435
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,996
You'll notice that
audio apps look a lot


436
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,226
like the built-in music app.


437
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:43,456
Users choose what to listen
to via a list-based UI,


438
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:47,346
and the Now Playing screen
shows the appropriate content


439
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:48,126
and controls.


440
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:51,496
The app needs to have a
special entitlement in order


441
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:53,036
to be compatible with CarPlay.


442
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:56,286
We've made some improvements
in iOS 10


443
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,746
to make the audio apps
experience even better.


444
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:04,336
New in iOS 10 is support for
tabs, which make it easier


445
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,116
to navigate list hierarchies.


446
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:10,256
In the Now Playing screen,
you can now see the app name


447
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,226
and additional playback
control buttons.


448
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:15,616
In the list views, you can
tell which item is playing,


449
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:18,326
which are available
for streaming,


450
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:20,586
explicit or live stream.


451
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,586
Some apps are designed
to play audio as soon


452
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,606
as they're launched,
and we've added support


453
00:25:25,606 --> 00:25:27,246
for these apps in iOS 10.


454
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:31,376
All of these combined make for
a much improved experience.


455
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:41,406
Check out the new tabs, the
Cloud icon for streaming apps,


456
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,726
and the way tend to note
what's currently playing.


457
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:51,596
In the now playing
screen, here's the app name


458
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:55,076
and the additional
playback controls.


459
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:59,676
Now let's talk about that
next category, apps written


460
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:01,236
to work in specific vehicles.


461
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,406
Apps published by
automakers are written


462
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:07,006
to control vehicle functions


463
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:09,476
or give information
about the vehicle.


464
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:14,146
They only appear in vehicles
specific to that automaker.


465
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:18,526
A CarPlay entitlement is
required for these apps as well.


466
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:24,086
New in iOS 10 is Siri
support for automaker apps


467
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,756
that control vehicle functions.


468
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:30,106
Siri now has built-in support
for changing radio stations,


469
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:32,896
changing climate
controls, and more.


470
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:36,346
The automaker app
communicates with the vehicle


471
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,126
to perform these functions


472
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:43,376
after Siri tells the app what
the user would like to do.


473
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:46,246
Let me explain how
automaker apps work only


474
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:47,576
in the cars that support them.


475
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:51,956
An app icon is enabled in
the CarPlay Home screen only


476
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:54,266
if the iPhone is
connected to a head unit


477
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,696
that supports the same
protocol name as the app.


478
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:59,836
A protocol name supported
by the head unit


479
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,086
and the app need to match.


480
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:06,416
iAP external accessory
is used for app


481
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,226
to head unit communication.


482
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:12,976
Head units can declare
multiple protocol names in order


483
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:15,056
to support current
and future apps


484
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:17,346
with different groups
of target cars.


485
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:20,506
Head units should
use a protocol name


486
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,916
to match all cars
from that brand.


487
00:27:23,316 --> 00:27:25,416
For example, com.brand.


488
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:29,726
They should also use
protocol names to match cars


489
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:31,696
with specific features,
for example,


490
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:33,636
electric vehicles
or sports models.


491
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,306
A protocol name for the specific
model should also be included


492
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:41,226
so that apps that target just


493
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,676
that model can be
published in the future.


494
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:49,236
The head unit needs
to use iAP2 to declare


495
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:52,896
at least one supported
external accessory protocol.


496
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:54,656
Likely more than one.


497
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:59,406
Start and stop external protocol
session must also be supported,


498
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:04,246
and external accessory protocol
CarPlay must be set to true.


499
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:08,136
If the car supports
wireless and wired CarPlay,


500
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,666
these iAP2 messages
should be implemented


501
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,696
on all supported transports.


502
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:17,946
Most automaker apps will
communicate with the car


503
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,336
to perform tasks such as
changing the climate controls.


504
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,446
These apps need to design


505
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:26,046
and implement a communication
protocol as well.


506
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:30,686
So how does the app
support this feature?


507
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:34,726
The app's Entitlements.plist
needs to be modified


508
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:37,706
to include the protocol
names that match those


509
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:40,206
on the target head
units, as shown here.


510
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:44,686
With these additions plus
support for the protocol


511
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:48,326
to communicate with the car,
and a CarPlay entitlement,


512
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,696
your app will be
ready for CarPlay.


513
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:54,096
We're looking forward to
seeing some great CarPlay apps


514
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:54,956
from automakers.


515
00:28:57,506 --> 00:29:00,166
We have a new category of
apps supported in CarPlay


516
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,326
and iOS10, messaging apps.


517
00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:06,036
When a messaging app has been
updated to support CarPlay,


518
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:08,776
that app will appear on
the CarPlay Home screen.


519
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:11,546
Messages can be received
and sent,


520
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:14,056
all driven by Siri interactions.


521
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:18,656
We're excited to extend CarPlay
capability to messaging apps,


522
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,276
making that experience
smarter and safer.


523
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:26,436
We hope this has been a
useful overview of CarPlay.


524
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:29,296
CarPlay is a great way to
keep the user experience


525
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:32,876
in vehicles fresh long into
the future, and we're delighted


526
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:35,396
to get a chance to talk
to you about the features


527
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:37,076
that are new in iOS 10.


528
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:44,686
For more information, check
out this session's WWDC URL.


529
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:49,866
We also have a follow-on
CarPlay deep dive video session


530
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:50,776
that may interest you.


531
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,066
Thank you for watching.
