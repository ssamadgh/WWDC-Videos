00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:27,536
>> Hi. Good morning.


3
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,346
Good afternoon.


4
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:35,476
My name is Ajit, and I used
to live and work not very far


5
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:37,666
from here on the East Bay.


6
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:41,716
I was an electrical engineer in
the heart of the Silicon Valley.


7
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:46,606
And in 2007, I did
something rather unusual.


8
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:50,886
I moved back to India from
California because I wanted


9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:51,856
to be an entrepreneur.


10
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:57,326
I'm an inventor at heart,
so I dabbled in a number


11
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:59,836
of different fields, a
number of different devices.


12
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:03,756
But eventually, I
chose an area to work


13
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:05,406
on that was rather
unconventional.


14
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:09,356
I decided I wanted to work
with kids with disabilities.


15
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,576
I wanted to make assistive
technology for children


16
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:17,116
who had difficulties with
various kinds of disabilities.


17
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:22,876
Now the way I got into
this particular field --


18
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:26,546
when I went back
to India in 2008,


19
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:28,696
there was a friend of mine.


20
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:32,376
And she runs a school in the
city of Chennai in the south


21
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:35,266
of India, and it's
called Vidya Sagar.


22
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,006
Now, Vidya Sagar is
a special school.


23
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:42,486
It's a school for kids with
various kinds of disabilities --


24
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:44,776
cerebral palsy, autism.


25
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:49,266
And when my friend found
out that I was looking


26
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:52,026
for instant problems
to solve, she suggested


27
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:55,796
that I visit the school and
interact with the kids and see


28
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,966
if there was anything
that struck me.


29
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,926
So I went to Vidya
Sagar and I sat down


30
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:03,236
and I met some of the kids.


31
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:06,496
Now that visit was
an eye-opener for me.


32
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:10,286
You know, I saw that these
kids were intelligent,


33
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:13,086
they were smart, they
were eager to learn,


34
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,046
they were enthusiastic,
they were social.


35
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:18,296
But the reason that they weren't


36
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,876
in a regular school was
primarily one reason.


37
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:24,206
And that was that they had
difficulty with communication.


38
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:30,356
Now, if you look at kids with
cerebral palsy, the main reason


39
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:34,006
that they can't communicate is
because the part of the brain


40
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:36,786
that process muscle
movements is impaired,


41
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,516
so they have difficulty
controlling all


42
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:41,726
of the different muscles that
are used to generate speech.


43
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:45,696
But with autism, it's actually
a very different story.


44
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,746
The first kid that I met
with autism was actually


45
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,616
at Vidya Sagar during
that visit.


46
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,026
His name was Santhosh.


47
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:57,006
Now I was sitting across
the table from Santhosh,


48
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:59,466
and Santhosh had a lot of
difficulty with a few things


49
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,306
that we take for granted.


50
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:05,276
For example, he found it really
hard to read my body language.


51
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:09,256
He would find it really hard
to see my face and to make


52
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,286
out what kind of emotion I
was feeling at that time.


53
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:15,116
The other thing that
Santhosh had a lot


54
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:16,756
of difficulty with was language.


55
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:20,766
Because language is
fundamentally very symbolic.


56
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,296
You know, it's very abstract.


57
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,626
It's not something that
we realize every day,


58
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:28,766
but it's really one of the most
abstract things that we use.


59
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:31,606
We have all of these
different sound sequences,


60
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:36,076
all of these different words,
and these words are something


61
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:38,976
that we assign meaning
to almost arbitrarily.


62
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,406
For example, if I
said the word "dog",


63
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:48,326
the word "dog" doesn't
have anything to do


64
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:51,306
with the animal the way
that I pronounce the word,


65
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:52,446
the way that I write the word.


66
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:54,246
You would never be
able to figure


67
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,806
out that it actually refers
to this particular animal.


68
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:01,316
It's very much abstract sound
through which we've assigned,


69
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,686
you know, a convention
that we agree on.


70
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:08,356
And that's why someone
with autism has a lot


71
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:09,356
of difficulty with this.


72
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:14,246
Our brains have the ability to,
you know, encode and decode tens


73
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:17,116
of thousands of these
arbitrary sound sequences.


74
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:21,555
But kids with autism find
it a little too fuzzy


75
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:22,926
for their comfort.


76
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:27,456
So my friend who runs
this school, Vidya Sagar,


77
00:04:27,456 --> 00:04:30,536
she wanted me to look at
this particular problem


78
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,066
and she wanted me to see if I
could come up with an invention


79
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,816
that could give a voice
to these children.


80
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:39,736
I thought that was a fascinating
problem to work on just


81
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:40,996
from a technology perspective.


82
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:44,296
I also thought it was a huge
opportunity in this case


83
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:46,856
because there were kids all
over India, and really all


84
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:50,786
over the world, who
needed something like this.


85
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:53,916
My starting point to
provide these kinds


86
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,956
of assistive technologies
was something


87
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:59,336
that had actually been
discovered in the 70s


88
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,366
and the 80s and was being
used quite effectively.


89
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:05,346
What people working with kids
with autism had discovered was


90
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,536
that many of them have extremely
strong visual intelligence.


91
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:12,476
So they have a lot of
difficulty with the abstractness


92
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:14,196
of language, but they
feel very comfortable


93
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,446
with the concreteness
of pictures.


94
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,946
They're able to remember
pictures.


95
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:21,756
They're able to recall pictures
much easier than they're able


96
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,836
to do with sound
or with alphabets.


97
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,936
Even in India, it wasn't
very uncommon to see kids


98
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,726
with books like these.


99
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:34,726
Picture books, picture charts,
picture bracelets sometimes


100
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,036
that they would wear
around their wrists.


101
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:40,836
And if they wanted to ask for a
specific object, if they wanted


102
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:43,796
to request for water for
example, they would point


103
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:48,716
to a picture of water in their
book and that would communicate


104
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,056
to other people that
they wanted water.


105
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:56,806
At that time in [inaudible]
America, in 2007 and 2008,


106
00:05:57,706 --> 00:06:01,816
this concept was being used
quite effectively as part


107
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:04,366
of these devices that
were being built.


108
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,536
And this is an example
of one of these devices.


109
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:11,276
This is a fairly -- you know,
these devices were pretty big.


110
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:12,226
They were pretty bulky.


111
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,756
They ran a special
software on them.


112
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:17,086
They were often custom-built,


113
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,776
and they were paid
for by insurance.


114
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,876
So they were pretty expensive.


115
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:23,456
This device, for example,
would have cost anywhere


116
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:25,786
between $5,000 to $10,000.


117
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:29,046
And that price point is
completely out of range


118
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:32,236
for even the most affluent
of parents in India.


119
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:36,426
But what was happening
with that in 2007,


120
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,316
for example, the
iPhone came out.


121
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,136
And that was the beginning
of the smartphone revolution.


122
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:46,106
Right? So it was possible
at that time, 2008,


123
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:50,306
to actually buy electronic
components off the shelf


124
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:52,166
which were being
used in smartphones,


125
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,576
in these touchscreen
devices all over the world.


126
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:59,116
And to assemble them together
to create a touchscreen tablet


127
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:00,956
for a fraction of the price just


128
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:04,196
for a few hundred
dollars instead of having


129
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:06,336
to create these things
from the ground-up.


130
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:10,366
So that became my strategy
going into this particular area.


131
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,106
I thought I would
create a special software


132
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:16,266
that they could use on top of
a device that we would build


133
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,036
from these smartphone
components,


134
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:23,426
and we would then use that
to give these children a way


135
00:07:23,426 --> 00:07:24,096
to communicate.


136
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:31,516
So I took this strategy and
then I plunged into the field


137
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,196
of creating assistive
technology.


138
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:38,686
And I quickly came up with
a very interesting talent.


139
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:43,716
You know, those of you who've
worked on solving hard problems


140
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:47,676
for a specific class of people,
you know that the process


141
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,596
of coming up with these
solutions is actually


142
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,256
pretty standard.


143
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:54,336
You go to the field, you talk to
people, and you listen to them,


144
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:55,266
you see what they have to say.


145
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:58,096
You ideate to come up
with these prototypes


146
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:02,356
and you build these
things that you take


147
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,586
to the people whose
problems you want to solve.


148
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,736
And then you get their feedback,
and then you iterate a number


149
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,996
of different times
till you have something


150
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:10,856
that works beautifully.


151
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,886
You know, that process
is very standardized.


152
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:16,556
In my particular case though,
I had a very peculiar problem.


153
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:20,396
Because the very reason that we
were building this device was


154
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,366
because these children
couldn't communicate.


155
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:25,416
So it was a chicken-and-egg
problem.


156
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,766
You know, we were
very happy to go


157
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,546
and ask them what they thought


158
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,086
about the prototypes
we were creating.


159
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:33,456
But what would actually
happen is


160
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:36,326
that the kids would use the
prototype for maybe a minute,


161
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,635
two minutes, and then
they would walk away.


162
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,586
And we had no idea -- you
know, were they tired?


163
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:42,436
Were they bored?


164
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,006
You know, did they not like it?


165
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:46,956
Did they think it was
completely worthless?


166
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:48,676
Were we solving the
wrong problem?


167
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:53,096
So that was a frustration
that, you know,


168
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:55,696
we lived with for
several months.


169
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,966
You know, every developer --


170
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,506
I'm sure every one of you here
has a happy-customer story


171
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:06,266
that's very close to your
hearts and that you really love.


172
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:12,256
You know, in my particular case,
you know, there was this boy.


173
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,906
His name was Rohit.


174
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:17,566
Rohit was one of the
people that we were trying


175
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,256
out every single one
of our prototypes with.


176
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:22,026
And one day, he came
into the room


177
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:23,716
where we were trying
out the prototype.


178
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,926
And I could see --
you know, on that day,


179
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,196
I could see the determination
in his face.


180
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:30,436
He was going to communicate
with me.


181
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:35,056
He was completely -- he had
that look of grim determination


182
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,336
as he walked into the room.


183
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:40,136
And, you know, I gave
him the newest prototype.


184
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,286
And I sat there, waiting
with anticipation.


185
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:45,976
And Rohit actually took
the device that I built.


186
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,906
Very painstakingly,
over several minutes,


187
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,296
he tapped on various buttons.


188
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,946
And then the device
said, "This sucks."

190
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,726e
[ Applause ]


191
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,726
[ Applause ]


192
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:08,836
It's not exactly the kind
of testimonial that is put


193
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:11,396
up on your website, but
it was music to my ears.


194
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:11,976
Believe me.


195
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:15,786
Because from that point onwards,
the going was much faster.


196
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:18,446
You know, we could convince him


197
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:19,916
to tell us exactly
what he liked,


198
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,036
exactly what he didn't like.


199
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:26,396
And within a few months,
we'd come up with a device


200
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:29,036
that met Rohit's expectations.


201
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,806
And that was the device that
we launched to the market.


202
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:34,076
We called it Avaz.


203
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,536
Avaz is the Hindi
word for "voice".


204
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,606
It also means similar things
in many other languages.


205
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:41,976
Let me show you the device
that we actually built.


206
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:58,556
So this was the first prototype
that was ready for release,


207
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:01,926
the first product that
we built off Avaz.


208
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:05,756
It's the big, bulky,
black metal box,


209
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:08,856
and it's stuffed
with electronics.


210
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:11,676
You know, you could
mount it on a wheelchair.


211
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,386
You could put it on a desk.


212
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:17,386
Along with its wheelchair mount,
it weighed about 8 pounds,


213
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:18,606
so it was pretty heavy.


214
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,566
It had about an hour
of battery life.


215
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:26,086
You know, there was a really
embarrassing thing that happened


216
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,066
on the day that we were
supposed to launch this.


217
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,906
We kept it on a desk, and a
kid accidentally pushed it


218
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:31,956
down with his hand.


219
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:34,656
And it fell down on the
floor and it broke one


220
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:35,676
of the tiles on the floor.


221
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:42,566
[ Laugther ]


222
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,126
That was how heavy it was.


223
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,646
You know, as a concession to
safety, among other things,


224
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,706
we replaced the case
with plastic.


225
00:11:53,326 --> 00:12:02,586
So that's the final version
of Avaz that we put out.


226
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:09,056
This device costs about $600
-- 30,000 Indian rupees.


227
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:12,456
And at that price, it was
about 1/10 of the price


228
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:14,676
of similar dedicated
devices that were


229
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:17,306
in the market at that time.


230
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:18,946
And it was a breakthrough
in India.


231
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,076
It was the very first time that
anyone had created a device


232
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,526
for speech-assistive
technology in India.


233
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:28,206
And almost immediately
after we had it out there,


234
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:31,236
we started getting orders
from all over the country.


235
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,266
You know, every special
school in India wrote to us


236
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:37,036
and they wanted to know how they
could get their hands on Avaz


237
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,076
and how they could use it.


238
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:41,736
But Avaz was still a
very niche product.


239
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:44,266
I mean, it's meant for the
very specific niche of people


240
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,746
that have these particular
disabilities.


241
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:52,606
So we had this -- you know,
making dedicated hardware


242
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:55,806
in these small volumes
is always a challenge.


243
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:58,216
So even though the
response was fantastic,


244
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,586
even though we got
a lot of interest,


245
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,406
and even though this was
really helping the kids


246
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:05,686
that we were intending
this to help, you know,


247
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,116
the more devices
we were selling,


248
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,526
the more money we were losing
just because we were spending


249
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:12,036
so much money in creating these
devices in the first place.


250
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,706
You know, we were
struggling to figure


251
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:18,106
out how we could make
the business sustainable.


252
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:24,066
And then in 2010, the
big news happened.


253
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:27,416
Steve Jobs announced the iPad.


254
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,606
And that was the start
of the tablet revolution.


255
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:34,266
But it also was a revolution
in the fortunes of my startup


256
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:37,976
because we saw this as a
way of getting ourselves


257
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:41,136
out of this hardware corner
that we painted ourselves into


258
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:45,946
and being able to make
these devices reach people,


259
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:48,376
making this application
reach people without having


260
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:49,756
to make the devices to do that.


261
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,776
So, in 2010, my team


262
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:55,586
and I started learning
how to code for iOS.


263
00:13:55,966 --> 00:14:02,926
And in 2011, we launched the
first version of the Avaz App.


264
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:06,266
Now the core functionality


265
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:10,706
of Avaz actually remains
the same today, you know,


266
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:12,746
compared to the first version


267
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,916
that we launched
way back in 2011.


268
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,976
And let me show you a
quick demo of how it works.


269
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:28,786
So this is Avaz.


270
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,096
And you can see that
it's essentially a bunch


271
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,086
of different pictures.


272
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,896
So there's pictures in here,
and there are pictures in each


273
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:38,166
of these different categories.


274
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:41,846
So there are literally thousands
of pictures in the app.


275
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:45,836
And a parent, or a teacher,
or a therapist could go in


276
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,486
and add words from the
child's life with photographs


277
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,166
from the child's life as well.


278
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,896
And the way that Avaz
works for a child


279
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:54,316
with a disability
is very simple.


280
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:59,386
A child would be able to recall
and remember these pictures.


281
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,706
And every time they
tap the picture.


282
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:02,526
>> I


283
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:04,456
>> It will speak that out.


284
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:07,006
And they would be able to
sequence pictures together.


285
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:07,606
>> Feel


286
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:11,106
>> This way, and they could go
into these different categories.


287
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:13,856
>> Describe feelings.


288
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,076
>> And they could pick
different pictures out.


289
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,236
>> Excited


290
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,246
>> To be able to
create sentences.


291
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:21,426
>> I feel excited.


292
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,646
>> And then the app
would speak that out.


293
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:28,906
So that's Avaz -- essentially,
a bunch of different pictures


294
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:32,536
with a picture vocabulary that
helps children communicate.


295
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:38,086
So Avaz was literally
an artificial voice


296
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:39,896
for kids with disabilities.


297
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:48,306
You know, when we put Avaz
out in the field in India,


298
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:51,536
it was immediately
a game-changer


299
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:52,536
in many different ways.


300
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:56,176
For this kid, Rohit,
who had worked with us


301
00:15:56,176 --> 00:16:00,216
to build Avaz, he
grew to love Avaz.


302
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,846
You know, he grew to be
able to customize and use it


303
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:07,536
so effectively that that same
year that we launched the app,


304
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:12,396
he went on to use Avaz to write
his exams and to finish school


305
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:15,386
and to go on to college.


306
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:18,416
You know, the media all over
India picked up the story


307
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,556
of this kid who'd
finished his exams


308
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:21,986
with an assistive-technology
device.


309
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:23,666
And not just this kid.


310
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:25,636
You know, they started
picking up stories from all


311
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:29,576
over the country about who kids
who had used Avaz to do things.


312
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:33,996
And even to this day, I think
Avaz has shaped the narrative


313
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:36,776
around these disabilities
in Indian media.


314
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:38,926
People started concentrating
less


315
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:42,306
on what these children could
not do and more on the abilities


316
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,866
of these children and
what they could do.


317
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:48,676
So that's one of the things that
Avaz has accomplished in India.


318
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,856
My personal favorite --


319
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:57,066
[ Applause ]


320
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,776
My personal favorite anecdote


321
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:03,286
about Avaz users is actually
something that happened back


322
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,836
in the school where
this all started,


323
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:07,606
in the school of Vidya Sagar.


324
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,935
You know, the children at Vidya
Sagar, every year they put


325
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:13,546
up this play for the parents


326
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:14,876
and for the well-wishers
of the school.


327
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:17,685
And it just so happens
that, you know, every year,


328
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:22,566
it was almost a convention that
the lead roles in this play,


329
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:25,705
the most important roles,
would go to the kids


330
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:27,616
who could speak -- I
mean, the verbal children.


331
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:28,766
And the presence


332
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:32,346
of the nonverbal children was
very subdued in this event.


333
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,746
The year we put out Avaz,


334
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:38,536
the principal made this
incredibly bold decision.


335
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:43,816
He said, "This year, all of the
parts are going to go to kids


336
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:46,096
who can't speak,
and they're going


337
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:48,386
to deliver their
dialogues with Avaz."


338
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:53,886
You know, I was sitting in
the front row on the day


339
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:55,066
that that play was going on.


340
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:58,386
You know, I was extensively
a special guest.


341
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,776
But really, the principal
expected me to jump


342
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:03,486
up on the stage and fix things
if something didn't work.


343
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,041
[ Laughter ]


344
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:07,986
But I was sitting in the
front row right there.


345
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:10,956
And the atmosphere
was incredible.


346
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:11,916
It was electric.


347
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:15,516
You know, I could see how much
fun these kids were having


348
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,386
delivering their dialogues and
doing all of their, you know,


349
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:20,916
all of their actions
and everything.


350
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:24,156
And I turn back and I looked at
the parents of these children,


351
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,396
and they had tears
in their eyes.


352
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,416
You know, this was
the very first time


353
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,876
that these kids were
able to participate


354
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,416
in this quintessential
school experience


355
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:36,916
of being a part of
a school play.


356
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:40,506
And at that moment, I think it
sank into many of those parents


357
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:43,366
about how transformational
this device would be


358
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:46,506
in the lives of these kids.


359
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:54,556
[ Applause ]


360
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:56,836
Another really important
moment in the history


361
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:59,936
of Avaz happened a little
later, a few months later.


362
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:04,136
We got a call -- you know,
our customer support person --


363
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:06,706
she got a call from a
parent in central India.


364
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,766
You know, so this
parent called her up.


365
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:13,086
And this call was actually --
it played out very differently


366
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,476
from most of the
calls that we get,


367
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,726
you know, for customer support.


368
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:20,106
This lady had bought
Avaz for her son.


369
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,326
And, you know, she wanted


370
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,666
to know a bunch of
different things.


371
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,586
You know, she wanted to know
how she could assess her son


372
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:28,956
for whether this device
was suitable for the son,


373
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:31,566
and she wanted to know how
to set it up for her son.


374
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:34,946
She wanted to know how to
integrate it into his lessons.


375
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:37,276
She wanted to know how to
set up curriculum around it.


376
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,326
She wanted to know how
she could track progress,


377
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:40,876
you know, over the months.


378
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,036
She essentially wanted
to know how


379
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:45,246
to implement the
app for her son.


380
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:51,836
Now this is actually a pretty
atypical question that we get.


381
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:55,476
Because in most installations
of Avaz that we've seen,


382
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:59,066
a speech therapist would be
the person that would work


383
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,656
with the kid in order to
implement the app for them.


384
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:04,076
So the speech therapist
would meet


385
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:06,266
with the kid maybe once a week,
they would do assessments,


386
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,496
they would do all of
these different things.


387
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:09,746
And so we asked this lady,


388
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:11,886
"Why don't you ask your speech
therapist these questions?


389
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:15,396
You know, that person is
probably much more qualified


390
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,026
to give you an answer to
some of these things."


391
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:18,786
On that day, I found


392
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:22,916
out something very
interesting about India.


393
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,746
This lady's son didn't
have a speech therapist.


394
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,986
In fact, the closest
speech therapist


395
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:32,006
to that lady was 300 miles away.


396
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,346
If she had to find a speech
therapist for her son,


397
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:37,806
she'd have to get on a
train, travel for six hours,


398
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:41,726
and go to a speech
therapist and come back home.


399
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,026
In fact, I'll tell you this.


400
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:44,916
In the entire country of India,


401
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:47,136
the country of 1.3
billion people,


402
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:50,506
there are 1,800 speech
therapists.


403
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:53,846
You could take all of the
speech therapists in India


404
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,726
and you could put
them in this room,


405
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,466
and you could fill this room
three times over with the number


406
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,816
of speech therapists
that are in India.


407
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:04,956
So this was a mind-blowing
moment for us.


408
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:07,056
This was really an
eye-opening moment for us.


409
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:10,856
And what we had to do eventually
was that we had to take the app,


410
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:14,486
Avaz, and we had to build this
complete new app inside it.


411
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,036
So it's almost like a
sub-app within Avaz.


412
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:18,916
And what that sub-app did --


413
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,676
it was a pretty new
idea at that time.


414
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:25,156
What that sub-app did was
that it trained a parent


415
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,926
to be a therapist
for their child.


416
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,546
That was the only way that we
could get over this problem.


417
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,076
You know, as a startup,


418
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:36,026
we couldn't train the 5 million
therapists that India needs.


419
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:39,486
But this was actually more
transformational in my opinion


420
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:42,726
than even Avaz itself because
we were not just giving a device


421
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:46,256
for the child, we were actually
building up the resource base


422
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:50,206
for these children to get
high-quality intervention,


423
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:56,666
and from the people that these
children mattered the most


424
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:58,676
to -- to their parents.


425
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:01,186
So this happened, you
know, in 2011 shortly


426
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,866
after we brought Avaz out.


427
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:05,856
And shortly after
that, I won an award


428
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:06,906
from the President of India.


429
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,976
I had less facial
hair back then.

But even more rewarding
than this --


432
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:16,096
you know, after five
years of lobbying --


433
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:22,496
this year, at long last, one of
the big states in India decided


434
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:26,846
to buy iPads, install Avaz on
them, and to give them away


435
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,236
to every school that they
supported in the state.

00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:36,646
This is the very first time


438
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:41,386
that the Indian government has
invested in assistive technology


439
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:43,216
for kids with speech
disabilities,


440
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:45,846
the very first time that the
Indian government has invested


441
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:46,876
in this stuff.


442
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:49,126
And in fact, the Apple guy
that's handling this order,


443
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,646
the guy at Apple that was
coordinating the delivery


444
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,216
of these devices, he told me


445
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:55,856
that this was the
largest-ever government order


446
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:57,366
of iPads in India.


447
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:58,496
And it's


448
00:22:58,496 --> 00:23:00,416
for an assistive-technology
application.


449
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,056
How cool is that?

[ Applause ]


452
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,766
Today, there are
about 30,000 kids


453
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,896
around the world whose lives
have been touched by Avaz.


454
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,326
Avaz is an artificial voice


455
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,936
for 30,000 children
around the world.


456
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:22,466
You know, at these
scales -- 30,000 users --


457
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,566
we could see some very
interesting patterns


458
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,016
in the way that Avaz was used.


459
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,006
And let me talk to
you a little bit


460
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:32,356
about how Avaz was being
used around the world.


461
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:37,096
What Avaz did very
successfully was


462
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:40,346
to help kids have this
alternate access to words.


463
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:43,116
So instead of having to speak
them out, instead of having


464
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:45,436
to remember how they sounded,


465
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:47,186
they could use pictures
to communicate.


466
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:50,966
So, for example, if a kid wanted
to say that they were hungry


467
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:53,766
and they wanted something to
eat, they could go into the app


468
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,226
and find the word
"eat" and tap on it.


469
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:58,396
If they wanted to say that they
wanted to go to the bathroom,


470
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,236
for example, they
could go into the app


471
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:01,326
and find the word "toilet".


472
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:03,536
If they were eating something


473
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:06,786
and they found the food
incredibly gross, they could go


474
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:08,686
into the app and they
could find the word "yucky"


475
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:12,556
and they could say that.


476
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:16,086
The problem happened when
kids had to communicate


477
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:18,176
with more than one word.


478
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:23,366
So, for example, if a kid
had to say, "I want water,"


479
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,676
it was quite common that
they would pick the word


480
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,796
"water" first and then they
would pick the word "want".


481
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:32,436
And they would do
it right sometimes.


482
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,516
They would do it
wrong sometimes.


483
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:35,096
But they were doing
it wrong as many times


484
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:35,866
as they were doing it right.


485
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:38,666
Or, for example, if they wanted
to say, "The boy is swimming,"


486
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:40,446
they would just pick
the word for "swim"


487
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,526
and they would pick
the word for "boy".


488
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,776
You know, they weren't really
creating these sentences.


489
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:50,296
You see, Avaz was very
successful at breaking


490
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:55,726
down this symbolism of words
and putting the concreteness


491
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:56,836
of pictures into that.


492
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,586
But this is actually a different
level of symbolism at play here.


493
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,336
This is a symbolism of grammar.


494
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:06,616
And grammar is something
that's so abstract,


495
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:07,856
and there are the
rules of grammar.


496
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,876
And those rules of
grammar are so abstract


497
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:13,296
that they're even very hard
for us as native speakers


498
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:14,976
to explain and to understand.


499
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:18,026
You know? For example, if
you take this sentence,


500
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:20,996
"I want to eat,"
what's the meaning


501
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:22,816
of the word "to"
in the sentence?


502
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:25,686
You know, if you asked me,
I wouldn't have an idea.


503
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,386
It's just a word that's there


504
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:30,496
because it's ungrammatical
if it wasn't there.


505
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:33,726
[ Laughter ]


506
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:37,126
If you take these sentences,
"The window broke," and,


507
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:39,396
"He broke the window,"
it's interesting, you know,


508
00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:41,396
these two sentences are
both grammatically correct.


509
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:43,926
But the object that's
breaking is actually the same.


510
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:45,746
Right? The window is the
object that's breaking.


511
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:49,466
Why is it that it appears on one
side of "broke" on one sentence


512
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,356
and on the other side of
"broke" in the other sentence?


513
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:56,146
Or if you take this sentence,
"I eat," the past tense


514
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,026
of this is obviously, "I ate."


515
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:01,706
But if you negate this sentence,
if you say, "I didn't eat,"


516
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:05,796
why is it wrong to
say, "I didn't ate"?


517
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:11,926
Right? So there are these
meta-rules at play here.


518
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:15,586
There are these things
that go beyond the rules


519
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:18,306
of which word presents
which meaning.


520
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,466
There are these meta-rules
of grammar.


521
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,116
And this was actually
very frustrating to us.


522
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:28,026
We went out behind the
pursuit Avaz with the intention


523
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:30,356
of giving communication,
full communication,


524
00:26:30,396 --> 00:26:32,396
equal communication to
kids with disabilities.


525
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:36,056
And we knew that our mission
was actually being completely


526
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:39,416
underfulfilled if we were
only giving them words


527
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:42,946
without giving them the
ability to also create sentences


528
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:44,046
and to put these words together.


529
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:47,446
The problem was that,
unlike in the case of Avaz,


530
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:50,166
there was actually
very little research,


531
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:53,946
very little theory behind
how you can teach children


532
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,636
with autism grammar,
how you can teach them


533
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:56,486
to put words together.


534
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:59,926
We trawled through all of
the scientific journals.


535
00:26:59,926 --> 00:27:01,506
We went to all of the
scientific conferences.


536
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,416
But very little insights
that people had got.


537
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:09,816
The insight that kind of
triggered a lot of ideas


538
00:27:09,816 --> 00:27:14,286
in our head quite consistently
came from the work of somebody


539
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:17,336
who lived 2,500 years ago.


540
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,756
He was an Indian philosopher.


541
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:23,976
I don't know if he
exactly looks like this.


542
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:26,071
[ Laughter ]


543
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:28,846
The Indian government put out
a stamp about him in 2004.


544
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,206
He has the unfortunate
distinction of sharing his name


545
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:33,106
with a kind of sandwich.


546
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:33,946
It's called Panini.


547
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:36,031
[ Laughter ]


548
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:41,906
But Panini lived in -- it didn't
mean "sandwich" back then.


549
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:44,031
[ Laugther ]


550
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:46,986
Panini lived around 500 BC.


551
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,446
And Panini did something
which was phenomenal,


552
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:51,886
which is unprecedented
even today.


553
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:55,736
He took a language, the
language of Sanskrit,


554
00:27:57,206 --> 00:28:03,396
and he created a concise,
complete, consistent set


555
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:08,756
of rules -- 4,000 rules -- that
described the entire language.


556
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:14,736
OK, so he had this set of 4,000
rules, and those rules are


557
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,286
of course still relevant today.


558
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:20,586
But with these 4,000 rules, if
you apply these 4,000 rules,


559
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:23,496
any sentence that you
created would be guaranteed


560
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:25,066
to be grammatically-correct
Sanskrit.


561
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:28,686
And conversely, any
grammatically-correct sentence


562
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:32,326
in Sanskrit, any sentence, any
book, any verbal reference,


563
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:36,396
any grammatically-correct
Sanskrit could be explained


564
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:38,156
with these 4,000 rules.


565
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:40,916
It was almost like he had
written a computer program


566
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:42,986
to generate Sanskrit.


567
00:28:43,496 --> 00:28:48,626
So that codification of a
language and the way that he did


568
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,156
that was absolutely beautiful.


569
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:51,306
It was phenomenal.


570
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:54,486
But that codification of
Sanskrit gave us the first clue


571
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,566
that maybe this is an
approach that we can take.


572
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:58,846
Maybe we can codify the
rules of grammar and put it


573
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:01,306
into a computer in some
sense and see if we can use


574
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,816
that to give kids with
autism an access to grammar.


575
00:29:05,886 --> 00:29:08,186
But even though we
had that insight,


576
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:11,796
the other missing component
was really the user experience.


577
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:14,016
How could we get kids to
interact with grammar?


578
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,996
And the answer to that really
appropriately came when I was


579
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:22,716
in a school for kids with autism
and I happened to interact


580
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:26,376
with -- I happened to
be present, you know,


581
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:29,136
where there was this little
girl, and there was her mother,


582
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,236
and there were her teachers.


583
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:33,066
And this girl, you
know, she had autism


584
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,716
and she was almost
completely nonverbal.


585
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:35,986
But once in a while,
she could speak.


586
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:37,836
And that's what happened
that day.


587
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:41,246
She jumped up and she
said the word "eat".


588
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,426
And there was no
context to this.


589
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:45,296
She just finished
eating her lunch,


590
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:47,186
so her teacher thought
perhaps she wanted


591
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,276
to talk about her lunch.


592
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:51,296
So they tried to get
her to communicate


593
00:29:51,296 --> 00:29:52,996
about her lunch on Avaz.


594
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:54,996
But it was very clear
that, you know,


595
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:56,266
that was not what she
was trying to say.


596
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:59,476
So we were all standing
there and trying to figure


597
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,566
out what she meant
by the word "eat".


598
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:05,006
And then her mother started
asking her questions.


599
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:08,816
So her mother said,
"OK, eat what?


600
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:09,956
Eat lunch?


601
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:10,656
Eat breakfast?


602
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:11,496
Eat snacks?"


603
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,936
And then the girl took out her
iPad, and she took out Avaz


604
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:16,416
and she pointed to
the word "ice cream".


605
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:19,596
And then her mother
asked, "OK, who eats?


606
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,576
You eat? Someone else eats?"


607
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,506
You know? And then she
pointed to the word "I".


608
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:27,356
And then her mother
was like, "Eat when?


609
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:28,256
Eat now? Eat later?"


610
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:31,106
And it turned out that
this particular girl wanted


611
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:33,616
to eat ice cream on her
way back home from school.


612
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:37,786
Now it's not often that
I can pinpoint the moment


613
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,376
when the lightbulb
goes off in my head.


614
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:42,836
But in this particular case,
I remember this episode almost


615
00:30:42,836 --> 00:30:43,756
like it happened yesterday.


616
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:49,266
Because what struck me was
that feeling of realization --


617
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:53,416
that realization that this
mother had gotten this girl


618
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,966
to communicate what she
wanted without using grammar.


619
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:02,026
I mean, this girl could not put
more than one word together.


620
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,366
She could not put multiple words
together to create sentences.


621
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:06,436
She could not select
different forms of words.


622
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:08,386
She did not know what
the meaning of "to" was.


623
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:12,846
She did not know the way in
which English grammar worked.


624
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:16,426
It's almost as if her mother had
peered into her head and figured


625
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:21,936
out what the meaning was
that she wanted to convey.


626
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:24,776
So this was the other
part of the puzzle for me.


627
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:27,386
You know, and I took this idea


628
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:31,056
that we could really represent
meaning without grammar


629
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:34,536
if we joined words together
using questions and answers.


630
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:37,886
And I combined that with
the algorithms that came


631
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:42,116
from my study of Panini and all
of the resource in linguistics


632
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,946
and the resource in
neuroscience that had been


633
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:44,936
over the last few years.


634
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:48,786
And I put that together
to create an app.


635
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:51,296
It took me three years to
actually create this app.


636
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,646
I started in 2012.


637
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:55,256
It was in 2015 that the
pieces finally came together.


638
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:59,716
And in 2016, we put
this app out --


639
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,166
this year, just a
few months ago.


640
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,486
It's called FreeSpeech.


641
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:07,136
And let me show you a quick
demo of FreeSpeech to explain


642
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,866
to you how we solved
this problem.


643
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:21,936
OK, so this is the
FreeSpeech App.


644
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:25,146
And you can see that it
has pictures the same way


645
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:26,346
that Avaz has pictures.


646
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:29,146
In fact, if I tap on the
More Words button here


647
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:32,956
on the bottom-left, it has all
of the pictures that Avaz has.


648
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:36,406
But unlike Avaz, when
you construct a sentence


649
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:39,066
in FreeSpeech, you
don't have to start


650
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,456
at the beginning
of the sentence.


651
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,356
In fact, you can start
anywhere in the sentence.


652
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:45,586
So, for example, supposing
I pick the word "take"


653
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:48,726
and I drop it here
on the screen.


654
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,166
Here's the interesting part.


655
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:50,886
>> Take


656
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:55,626
>> The app actually gives you
this lattice this scaffold


657
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:59,236
of questions around the word
that you've just dropped


658
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:02,986
so that you can add more words
to create a sentence out of it.


659
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:05,666
It's very similar to what
the girl's mother was doing.


660
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,886
For example, if I drag
the word "teacher"


661
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,706
and I put it into
the word "who".


662
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:13,416
>> The teacher takes.


663
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:15,856
>> It automatically
constructs a sentence


664
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:17,706
with that specific meaning.


665
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:18,806
It says, "The teacher takes."


666
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:22,506
I can take the word "book", and
if I put it into the "what",


667
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:25,496
it will say, "The
teacher takes the book."


668
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:29,186
And if I take the word "school"
and if I drop it on the word


669
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:34,506
"to", it will say, "The teacher
takes the book to the school."


670
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:38,076
Let me show you a slightly
more complicated example.


671
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:41,306
So, supposing we pick the
word "want", and let's put


672
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:44,376
that in here, it pops up
all of these questions.


673
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:49,026
And I can take the word "parent"
and I put it into the "who".


674
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,636
If I put into "want",
for example,


675
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,326
it will say, "Want the parent."


676
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:55,896
But if I took that from that
location and if I put it


677
00:33:55,896 --> 00:33:58,526
into the "who", it will
say, "The parent wants."


678
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,146
And you see that every
time you add a word,


679
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:02,366
it actually gives you
even more questions.


680
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:03,496
So more questions pop up.


681
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:05,276
So you can see that
there's a "whose"


682
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,346
which is next to "parent".


683
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,766
So if I tap that, it will
ask you the question,


684
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:10,666
"Whose parent wants?"


685
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,116
And then I can drag the
word "she", for example,


686
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,485
and drop that in here.


687
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,386
It will say, "Her parent wants."


688
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:20,036
If I tap this little button on
the top-left corner of "parent",


689
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,755
I can convert that
into a plural.


690
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:24,206
So I can make it,
"Her parents want."


691
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:28,416
If I add the word "see",
for example, I can say,


692
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:30,866
"Her parents want to see."


693
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:33,516
And I can drag the word
"you" and I can make it,


694
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:35,216
"Her parents want to see you."


695
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,005
In fact, I can do even more
complicated things here.


696
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:41,226
I can say that all of
this happened in the past.


697
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:43,806
And I don't have to use the
rules of grammar to do this.


698
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,416
All I can do is I
can tap the button


699
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,356
at the bottom that says Past.


700
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:50,636
It will say, "Her parents
wanted to see you."


701
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:52,016
And I can negate that.


702
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:54,576
So if I press the Not button
at the bottom, it will say,


703
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:57,166
"Her parents didn't
want to see you."


704
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:59,176
I can make a question out of it.


705
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:01,276
>> Didn't her parents
didn't want to see you.


706
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:03,956
>> Or I can make even more
complicated questions.


707
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,586
[ Applause ]


708
00:35:07,086 --> 00:35:08,976
>> Why didn't her
parents want to see you.


709
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:11,546
[ Applause ]


710
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:12,346
Thank you.


711
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:13,986
Thank you.


712
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:15,616
So that's how FreeSpeech works.


713
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,216
And FreeSpeech is pretty amazing


714
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,056
because I think it's
the very first time


715
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:23,056
that someone has actually come
up with a grammar predictor.


716
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,176
That's what the app
is doing, right?


717
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:26,866
I mean, you have all of
these different pictures


718
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:29,246
and the app is putting
grammar around it.


719
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:32,026
Now why is that important
for kids with autism?


720
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:35,506
The best way to kind of explain
that is to draw an analogy


721
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:36,656
to a different disability.


722
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:39,126
I'm sure many of you here
have heard of dyslexia.


723
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:40,666
Some of you may have
even struggled


724
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:41,506
with it when you were kids.


725
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,546
Kids with dyslexia have a lot
of difficulty with spelling.


726
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,556
You know, English
spelling is horrible.


727
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:48,376
I have difficulty
with English spelling.


728
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:51,996
But if you give a kid
with dyslexia an iPad


729
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:54,086
and you ask them to type,


730
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:57,336
magically their disability
goes away.


731
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:00,076
Why? Because of spell check.


732
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:01,116
Because of autocorrect.


733
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:05,056
So a kid with dyslexia who
is typing on an iPad is able


734
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:08,236
to communicate, is able to type
perfectly correct English even


735
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:09,516
though they have
difficulties with spelling.


736
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,306
Avaz does exactly that for kids


737
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:14,836
who have a language
disability like autism.


738
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,446
It plays to their strengths.


739
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:20,456
They're able to take
pictures, they're able to pick


740
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:26,176
out pictures from the tablet,
and they're able to put pictures


741
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:28,016
in different configurations.


742
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:29,666
But every time they do that,


743
00:36:30,116 --> 00:36:33,746
the algorithm is automatically
creating a perfectly-grammatical


744
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:36,906
sentence and is speaking
that out.


745
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:41,516
Now, we did trials for about
an entire year before we put


746
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,926
FreeSpeech out on the market.


747
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:46,256
And the results with kids


748
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:48,306
with autism were dramatic
-- truly dramatic.


749
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,856
There were kids who were
communicating with no words


750
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:52,306
or they were communicating
with one word.


751
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,246
And suddenly, in minutes --


752
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,346
literally minutes after they
started using the app --


753
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:58,766
they were constructing these
four or five-word sentences.


754
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:01,566
In fact, there was this
one particular kid --


755
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:03,116
I want to show you
a video of this kid.


756
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:08,576
This kid was in -- you know,
he was using, you know,


757
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:09,806
single words to communicate.


758
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:15,736
And you can see that he's not
just using FreeSpeech very


759
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:16,986
fluently, but he's actually --


760
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,156
FreeSpeech is teaching
him to talk.


761
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:22,496
Let's look at the video.


762
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,536
>> Eat want.


763
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:29,976
>> So, the kid is
trying to speak.


764
00:37:30,086 --> 00:37:30,496
>> Drag.


765
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:32,096
>> Eat.


766
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:34,066
>> Eat.


767
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:38,906
>> He eats.


768
00:37:38,996 --> 00:37:39,786
>> He eats.

>> Did he eat lunch?

>> Did he eat lunch?

00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:20,156
>> Good job!

[ Applause ]


786
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,226
>> This is pretty incredible.


787
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,266
You know, this kid was in --


788
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:36,026
this is a kid in
Portland, in Oregon.


789
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:39,906
And this kid's speech
therapist, you know,


790
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:41,336
he was completely
blown away by this.


791
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:44,836
In fact, his therapist
-- his name was Lucas.


792
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:47,816
You know, before Lucas
became a speech therapist,


793
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:48,616
he was a linguist.


794
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:50,836
And so he sent this video to us.


795
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:53,976
And to say he was blown
away is an understatement


796
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:56,526
because the same day that I
got this video, I got an email


797
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:59,486
from Lucas asking me if he could
quit his job and join my team.


798
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:02,031
[ Laughter ]


799
00:39:02,046 --> 00:39:04,286
And that's how Lucas
became our resident expert


800
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:05,726
in speech therapy in autism.


801
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:13,116
In fact, when we put
FreeSpeech out, you know,


802
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:15,206
Lucas also had a
very interesting idea


803
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:18,226
because Lucas had this
other kid on his caseload.


804
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,346
And this other kid had a --
you know, he was an Avaz user


805
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:23,436
but he was facing a very
different kind of problem.


806
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:25,796
This other kid that was


807
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,836
on Lucas' caseload,
he was bilingual.


808
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:31,796
He came from a bilingual
family --


809
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,416
bilingual, English and Spanish.


810
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:36,846
So, at school, he would
be learning in English.


811
00:39:36,906 --> 00:39:38,456
All of his teachers would
talk to him in English.


812
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:42,916
But when he went back home, his
family, and all of his friends,


813
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:44,896
and all of his neighbors, they
would be speaking in Spanish.


814
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:50,156
Now this is a challenge that
speech therapists have battled


815
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:52,096
with for many, many years.


816
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:55,486
You know, devices like Avaz,
apps like Avaz do exist.


817
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:56,906
They do exist in
different languages.


818
00:39:57,616 --> 00:40:00,806
But the problem of how do
you give a voice to somebody


819
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:03,516
who speaks two different
languages has always been a


820
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:06,026
challenge for kids with autism


821
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:08,136
and for the therapists
that work with them.


822
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:12,166
So, let me give you a short demo
of why exactly that's a problem.


823
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:15,616
Let me go back into
Avaz and explain


824
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,606
to you what the issue is.


825
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:20,586
So, this is Avaz, right?


826
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,336
So we looked at the
-- I'm just going


827
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,136
to create a very quick sentence.


828
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:28,656
I'm going to say, "I want
to," and I go to Actions.


829
00:40:28,656 --> 00:40:29,916
And let's say, "I
want to go home."


830
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:33,676
Right? So I pick out these
different words here.


831
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:36,656
And so let's say that a kid
is able to make this sentence,


832
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:38,476
"I want to go home,"
and they can speak it.


833
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:42,976
Now there is a Spanish
version of Avaz available,


834
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:45,666
so let me switch into
that very quickly.


835
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:49,096
So -- yeah.


836
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:52,786
How many Spanish
speakers in the audience?


837
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:55,816
OK. I don't know Spanish at all.


838
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:56,906
I know zero Spanish.


839
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:01,176
But, you know, I'm going
to try to use the pictures


840
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,656
to create a Spanish sentence
of exactly the same thing.


841
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,036
So, let's see.


842
00:41:06,036 --> 00:41:07,596
So I have the picture
for the word "I".


843
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:09,056
I can recognize that.


844
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:09,516
That's here.


845
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,796
And then I have "want".


846
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:15,606
And this looks like the
picture for the word "to".


847
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,746
And this is "go".


848
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:21,166
And so there's places in here.


849
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:24,646
And this is "home".


850
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:29,916
Is that the right
sentence in Spanish?


851
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:34,416
If I went to Mexico and if I
said this, a kid would laugh


852
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,106
at me because this is
completely grammatically wrong.


853
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,616
You see, I've actually
done a pretty good job


854
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,746
of picking the right
words out the words --


855
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,626
the words "I", "want", "go".


856
00:41:44,626 --> 00:41:45,506
All of these are correct.


857
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:49,646
But in Spanish, the way that the
words work is very different.


858
00:41:49,646 --> 00:41:54,126
For example, the word "querer"
-- the word that means "want" --


859
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:57,006
you actually have to inflect
that so it becomes "quiero"


860
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:59,806
when you use it for
the word "I".


861
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,196
And similarly, you
don't use the word "tu"


862
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:04,736
in Spanish the same way that
you use it with English.


863
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:06,416
You'd actually put that
word before the word


864
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:09,046
"casa" to say "tu home".


865
00:42:09,566 --> 00:42:12,736
So the problem here is
that when you switch


866
00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:14,176
between two different languages,


867
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:15,886
the interface actually
looks very similar.


868
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:16,856
And you can see that, right?


869
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:18,926
The Avaz interface
looks almost identical


870
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:20,186
between the two languages.


871
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:24,106
But the user experience is
actually completely different


872
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:26,626
because kids have to learn
completely different patterns


873
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,326
to be able to construct
these sentences


874
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:29,586
and to be able to
put them together.


875
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:35,336
So this was a problem that
not just my friend, Lucas,


876
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,486
but really everyone
who was working


877
00:42:37,486 --> 00:42:38,486
with kids with disabilities.


878
00:42:38,796 --> 00:42:42,846
Essentially, the child had to
learn two different patterns


879
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:46,016
of using the same app for them
to be able to communicate.


880
00:42:47,206 --> 00:42:49,326
So the idea that kind of
went off in our heads was,


881
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,556
"Can we use FreeSpeech
to be able to do this?"


882
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,266
FreeSpeech is essentially,
in some sense,


883
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:56,376
a representation of meaning.


884
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:58,176
Right? So the way that you
put these words together,


885
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,816
the way that you
construct these sentences,


886
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:02,436
they're essentially
conveying what the meaning is


887
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:03,526
that you're trying to say.


888
00:43:03,686 --> 00:43:05,376
And the app is putting
the words together.


889
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:09,416
So can we use that to be able to
help kids construct sentences,


890
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:12,086
you know, even if they
have a different language?


891
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:13,416
So I'm going to go
into the Settings here,


892
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,976
and there's a Spanish
setting here.


893
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:17,976
And you can see that,
when you do that,


894
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:20,126
the interface completely
changes into Spanish.


895
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:23,756
And all the words
are in Spanish.


896
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:26,366
The labels are in
Spanish and everything.


897
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:28,996
And when I drag a word
and I put it in here,


898
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:32,486
all of the interface elements
here are in Spanish as well.


899
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:36,056
The questions are in Spanish,
the tenses, everything.


900
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:37,606
But here's the interesting part.


901
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:39,796
When I start putting words in,


902
00:43:40,456 --> 00:43:41,116
>> I want.


903
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:44,586
>> It actually gives me an
English sentence as the output.


904
00:43:45,096 --> 00:43:49,866
So I can say -- so if I want to
try to make the same sentence,


905
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,016
I can take the same words


906
00:43:52,016 --> 00:43:53,116
>> I want to go.


907
00:43:53,116 --> 00:43:54,666
>> And I can put that in here.

the same user interface.

if they can do this with those
kids to teach them English.


923

So could you use FreeSpeech
to teach someone English?

It's actually creating
a sentence.

that I did with English.

For example, I can say,
"That happened in the past."

I can say, "It didn't happen."

is that kids learn a
language much faster


1012
00:49:22,886 --> 00:49:25,336
and much more effectively
than adults


1013
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:26,696
because they're immersed in it.


1014
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:30,696
You know, they hear it,
they try to speak it,


1015
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:33,386
and they know what the meaning
is of what's being said to them


1016
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:35,046
because they understand
the context


1017
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:35,876
in which it's being said.


1018
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:39,566
What if we could
simulate emotion


1019
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:43,836
and provide the same capability
to adults and older children?


1020
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:47,966
That's why I'm excited about
the prospect of FreeSpeech.


1021
00:49:47,966 --> 00:49:49,986
Because with FreeSpeech,
you're making these sentences,


1022
00:49:50,266 --> 00:49:51,516
and you know what the meaning is


1023
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:53,116
because you're using
pictures as a bridge.


1024
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,296
And every time you make
sentences in FreeSpeech,


1025
00:49:56,806 --> 00:49:59,126
the app is telling you
what the sentence means


1026
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:00,946
in the language you're
trying to learn.


1027
00:50:00,946 --> 00:50:03,856
That's the interesting thing,


1028
00:50:03,856 --> 00:50:05,656
and that's what we're
working on.


1029
00:50:07,076 --> 00:50:10,396
You know, language is something


1030
00:50:10,396 --> 00:50:13,566
which is really interesting
for multiple reasons.


1031
00:50:14,126 --> 00:50:19,476
In this connected world
where anyone anywhere


1032
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:23,546
in the world is two clicks away
on Facebook or on WhatsApp,


1033
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:26,386
language is really
the last barrier


1034
00:50:26,386 --> 00:50:27,556
that we have as a species.


1035
00:50:28,356 --> 00:50:29,586
I mean, think about it.


1036
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:32,096
Right? How many of
you have a friend


1037
00:50:32,726 --> 00:50:34,736
with whom you don't
share any language?


1038
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:40,636
You know, communication
is the fundamental barrier


1039
00:50:40,636 --> 00:50:42,656
that children with
disabilities are born with.


1040
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:46,446
But it's also the last barrier
that we have to cross as people.


1041
00:50:46,446 --> 00:50:48,786
And that's why the
work that I do is


1042
00:50:48,786 --> 00:50:50,716
so satisfying and
exciting to me.


1043
00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:55,436
You know, I build apps that
help kids with disabilities,


1044
00:50:55,746 --> 00:51:00,206
kids with disadvantaged
education backgrounds, refugees.


1045
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:04,306
You know, I build apps
that use Apple's devices


1046
00:51:04,306 --> 00:51:05,816
to make the lives of
these people better.


1047
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:08,026
But I'm hopeful that
some of the work


1048
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:12,186
that I'm doing could
also help all of us look


1049
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:14,556
with a different light and
with a different appreciation


1050
00:51:15,016 --> 00:51:18,366
at the most beautiful,
most expressive


1051
00:51:18,806 --> 00:51:21,016
of human inventions -- language.


1052
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:22,396
Thank you.


1053
00:51:23,516 --> 00:51:29,500
