    Abstract:
    Primary view controller for what is displayed by the application. In this class we configure an MKMapView to display a floorplan, recieve location updates to determine floor number, as well as provide a few helpful debugging annotations.
    
                We will also show how to highlight a region that you have defined in PDF coordinates but not Latitude  Longitude.
