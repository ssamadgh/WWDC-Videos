DESCRIPTION:

This sample illustrates how to manipulate attributes and relationships in an iPhone application.

The application extends the the completed project from the Core Data Tutorial for iPhone OS. The first screen displays a table view of events, which encapsulate a time stamp, a geographical location expressed in latitude and longitude, and a name for the event. The user can add, remove, and edit events using the first screen.

Events have a to-many relationship to tags (which have an inverse to-many relationship to events). Tags have a name which describes a feature of an event. Tags are displayed in a second table view; when a tag is related to the selected event, a check mark is displayed in the corresponding row.
