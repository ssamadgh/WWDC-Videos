00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,276
>> Nathan de Vries:
Good afternoon everyone.


2
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:14,866
My name's Nathan de Vries
[phonetic] and today I'm going


3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:18,036
to be talking to you about iAd
Integration into your Apps.


4
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,576
Now there are two major
opportunities the iAd presents


5
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:22,696
to developers.


6
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,556
The first is promoting
your applications


7
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:28,546
with the new iAd
Workbench feature


8
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:29,806
that was announced this week.


9
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:34,326
And the second thing is
a revenue opportunity


10
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,296
for your applications.


11
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:39,066
So using application to generate
revenue through advertising,


12
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,216
and that's what we're going
to be talking about today.


13
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:44,106
How to integrate iAds
into your applications


14
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:45,396
to generate revenue.


15
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:49,016
Now we're going to be doing
that by going through this flow.


16
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:51,296
We're going to start by talking


17
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,946
about the developer
benefits of iAd specifically.


18
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,686
Why it might be a
good choice for you


19
00:00:56,686 --> 00:00:58,616
to generate revenue
in your applications.


20
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,536
Then we're going to look at some
core concepts that are critical


21
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:05,706
in understanding why your
application is generating


22
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:08,756
revenue in the way it is, how
you can improve on that revenue


23
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:10,916
by making adjustments
to your application,


24
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:12,266
and we're also going to go


25
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,996
into a little bit more detail
beyond those core concepts


26
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,486
and talk about specific
things that you can do


27
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,686
to optimize ad performance
in your applications.


28
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:23,306
Next we're going to briefly look
at how to join the iAd network.


29
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:24,356
It's very easy.


30
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:28,006
And lastly, which is the major
chunk of the presentation


31
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,846
which you're all here
for, is to look at some


32
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:34,526
of the developer API's
for integrating iAds


33
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:35,536
into your application.


34
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,966
So let's start with
the developer benefits.


35
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:43,496
First and foremost,
ignoring ads all together,


36
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:46,396
you put huge amount of effort
into your applications,


37
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:49,636
which they mix with applications
that have won the design awards,


38
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,046
blood, sweat and tears get
poured into your applications.


39
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,026
So you really want experiences
within your application


40
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:58,386
that match the amount of
effort that you put in.


41
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:02,196
So first and foremost, we really
want to delight your customers.


42
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:05,776
So that's why the advertisements


43
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:08,996
with iAd have very
high production values.


44
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,926
We put a lot of attention
to detail into the ads


45
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:16,436
so that your users get the same
beautiful enriched experiences


46
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,266
that they expect from your app.


47
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:24,106
As part of this rich experience,
iAd support media, playback,


48
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:27,726
and game-type experiences,
really adding


49
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:30,836
to the features of
your application.


50
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,206
Like your application that
has access to amazing API's


51
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:38,976
on the platform like Gyroscope
and Cameran and so on,


52
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:41,906
ads also have access
to these API's.


53
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:45,336
The ads are seamlessly
integrated with iOS' software


54
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:48,906
and as hardware, so there's
not this sandboxed limited


55
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:50,346
experience inside an ad.


56
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,186
It's just an app.


57
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,426
And this creates this kind


58
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,696
of immersive experience
for the user.


59
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,606
If they choose to
engage with an ad,


60
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:01,266
it feels like this amazing
experience for them.


61
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,936
And that's what we're
really trying to achieve.


62
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:06,686
And you can see here the
types of examples of ads


63
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,346
where you can really shake
the app and it interacts


64
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,196
with the ad, or you
can play music


65
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:13,206
or a game, watch move trailers.


66
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,616
These are all the
kinds of things


67
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:16,576
that advertisers are
providing in their ads.


68
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:21,416
And lastly, even though when the
user engages in an ad and their


69
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,166
in this [inaudible] experience,
their still in your app.


70
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,106
So as soon as I dismiss
the ad, they're right back


71
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:28,946
in your app where they left off.


72
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,296
Just seamlessly in and
straight out again.


73
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:38,236
So because the ad is inside
your app, we value the privacy


74
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:40,556
of the users of your
application.


75
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:43,326
This is why we request
permission before asking


76
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:47,586
for contact access in your
application, or photo access,


77
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,306
because we really
value the privacy


78
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:51,576
of the users of your
application.


79
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,456
Likewise, with advertising,
we also have


80
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:57,316
that same approach to privacy.


81
00:03:57,316 --> 00:04:00,266
So we handle the privacy, so you
don't need to worry about it.


82
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:01,816
Users start using ads


83
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:05,476
within your application have
the same privacy thought


84
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,706
about that we do for your app.


85
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,886
The world's best
brands are using iAd.


86
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:16,786
So all around the world we have
agencies working with brands,


87
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:19,156
winning design awards
for advertising,


88
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,906
using the iAd platform.


89
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:25,496
So all creating is, these brands
are very familiar to your users,


90
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,116
so their much more likely to
engage in the advertising,


91
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:32,796
and that really drives
the immersive experience


92
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:33,566
for the users.


93
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:38,196
Every year we're
expanding so far.


94
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:41,476
We started in the U.S. We've
recently rolled out into Mexico.


95
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,466
There's 11 countries
now that we support.


96
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:48,706
So there's a great opportunity,
not just to advertise locally,


97
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,386
but also broadly,
and we'll speak


98
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:54,076
about that a little bit later.


99
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,846
It's also a menu
here to work out how


100
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,456
to monetize your application.


101
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:00,076
It's a great path to revenue.


102
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:02,836
When your application
displays an advertisement,


103
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,536
the advertising revenue that's
generated from the display,


104
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:10,266
and the interaction with those
ads, 70% of that revenue goes


105
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,566
to you as a developer.


106
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,516
So we think that's a really
great way for you to make money


107
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:15,546
with your applications.


108
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:20,356
And lastly, as developers, it's
incredibly easy to implement.


109
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,426
You'll be able to jump to
that later on when we go


110
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:25,496
into the developer
details, but we really feel


111
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:27,886
like we've made it as
easy as possible for you


112
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:29,526
to integrate ads into
your application.


113
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,846
There's no need to link
against additional SDK's,


114
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:37,536
so no need to maintain
and download other SDK's.


115
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:42,556
You can be up and running in
really small amount of code.


116
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,816
We also have some great sample
code which you'll notice


117
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,896
on the developer@apple.com
website, which I'll link


118
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:48,846
to a little bit later.


119
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:52,636
This provides the iAd
Suite sample code,


120
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,346
as well as developer
documentation.


121
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:57,396
If you were to really dive
in and see examples of how


122
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,276
to integrate ads into
your application.


123
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:03,146
And lastly, we think that's
always been pretty easy


124
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,686
to integrate ads, but we've
made it even easier this year


125
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:06,806
with iOS 7.


126
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,796
So we're looking
forward to your feedback


127
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:09,796
on some of the new stuff.


128
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,836
Next let's have a look
at some core concepts.


129
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:16,746
Integrating iAds
into your application


130
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,946
from a developer point of
view is incredibly easy.


131
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,386
You'll get up and
running very quickly.


132
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:25,396
But there are some core
concepts related to advertising


133
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:28,316
and iAds specifically that
are useful to have in the back


134
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:30,266
of your mind when you're
integrating the ads


135
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,176
because once you've
shipped your application,


136
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,276
it's in the app store, and
customers are using your app,


137
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,466
you're going to need
to track the progress


138
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:38,866
of revenue generated
by your app.


139
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:41,816
So some of these core concepts
are going to keep coming


140
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:45,406
up in your sales reports and
changes that you need to make


141
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,896
to your application
to improve some


142
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,956
of the ad performance,
so we'll start there.


143
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:53,146
First of all, what is
the iAd App Network?


144
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,066
Well we mentioned briefly
that there's the two things


145
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,456
that that the iAd network
really provides to developers;


146
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,936
the path to revenue, which
we're talking about today,


147
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,276
and also the promotional
aspect promoting your app.


148
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:09,426
So the iAd App Network is the
Apple business team working


149
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:12,796
with advertisers to produce
inventory and delivering them


150
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:15,126
to you, the developer
that's integrating iAds.


151
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,986
So what does this look like?


152
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:22,626
You've linked your application
against the iAd framework.


153
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:26,416
What this means is that
the iAd framework is going


154
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,806
to send requests to
the iAd App Network


155
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:31,126
on your behalf asking ads.


156
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:35,326
So we send ad requests to the
App Network, which replies,


157
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,426
as you'd expect, with ads.


158
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:42,286
So this combination of two
things: The requests being sent


159
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:46,186
to the network and the ads being
sent back form this concept


160
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:46,986
called the Fill Rate.


161
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,136
Those of you that are familiar


162
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,826
with advertising probably
have heard of this before,


163
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:54,866
but this is the measure of
performance of requests sent


164
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,466
by all of your applications,
versus the ads


165
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,546
that are delivered
by the network.


166
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,076
And we'll come back to
that when we're talking


167
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,346
about improving app performance.


168
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:08,286
Once you've been delivered an
ad, you still have to display it


169
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,406
on the screen, so just
getting an ad isn't enough,


170
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,496
you have to show it to the user.


171
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,186
That's the point of this.


172
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,296
So that's called an impression.


173
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,636
As soon as you display
an ad to a user,


174
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,476
it's called an impression,
and a certain percentage


175
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:24,496
of those impressions will
hopefully turn into Tap Throughs


176
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:26,036
when the user engages
with the ad.


177
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:30,286
And these two concepts combined
are called the Tap Through rate.


178
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,986
So the number of Tap Throughs,
versus the number of impressions


179
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,226
that you're shown in your app.


180
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:38,756
And you'll see these
as well in your reports


181
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:41,466
when you're measuring the
performance of your app.


182
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:44,056
So that's a few of
the core concepts.


183
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,846
We'll refer back to them
later on in the presentation.


184
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,986
Next let's look at some
tangible things that you can do


185
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,136
to improve the ad performance


186
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,966
of your application before you
even get started with the code.


187
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:03,316
So first and foremost, it
all starts with a great app.


188
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,786
You need to focus
on the customer.


189
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,516
Your app needs to have
utility and be useful,


190
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:12,216
so ignoring the advertising side
of things, your app just has


191
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,586
to be something that you
want lots of people to use.


192
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,206
They find it really useful.


193
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:17,676
They come back to it.


194
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:20,116
There's loyalty associated
with your app.


195
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,066
People just really have
to want to use our app.


196
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:24,606
I'm recommending going
to some of the sessions


197
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,336
on design during the conference,
or watching them on the videos,


198
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,266
because honing is
part of your app.


199
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:31,826
It is going to be a
key to the success


200
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:33,746
of advertising in your app.


201
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,946
Having a great app, or
something that's worth talking


202
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,826
about will generate
network effects.


203
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,836
So you'll start getting
reviews on the app store,


204
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,086
people will talk about your app,


205
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:45,676
and all of these things
result in more ad requests.


206
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:49,816
So as a side effect of focusing
on the customer and your app,


207
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,876
you're immediately going
to get more ad requests,


208
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:57,266
more ads served, which
is better for your app.


209
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:02,076
The next thing that you can
do is to place ads smartly.


210
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,666
Key here is not place
ads everywhere.


211
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:08,116
You have to really
consider user context,


212
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,036
as well as recognizing high
use areas in your application,


213
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:14,646
so when you're looking
at a holistic view


214
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:15,576
of your application,


215
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,986
really consider is
this view appropriate


216
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:20,626
to advertising how
many users are entering


217
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:22,866
into this part of my app.


218
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,296
You want to avoid
accidental taps.


219
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,656
So placing ads in spots


220
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:31,856
where users might accidently
tap the ad isn't a good thing


221
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,186
because it might
be an impression,


222
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:35,976
but if people are tapping on the
ad and immediately dismissing it


223
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,066
because it was a mistake?


224
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,686
That's not going to be very
good for your ad performance.


225
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,116
And really keep in
the back of your mind


226
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,466
when you're designing your
apps and integration of ads


227
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,786
into your apps, that user
context is incredibly important.


228
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:52,626
So you really need to weigh up
the benefit of an impression


229
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:55,226
versus what the user
was trying to do


230
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:56,486
when you were showing that ad.


231
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:59,576
So things like showing
advertisements


232
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,616
during registration.


233
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,246
Maybe you want to
show advertisements


234
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,306
after registration
because the success


235
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:07,056
of your app is predicated
on someone signing up,


236
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,346
enjoying the app, and
coming back to the app,


237
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:12,406
which will produce more
advertising revenue for you.


238
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,496
You should also consider
customer location.


239
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:19,346
I mentioned that we support
11 different countries


240
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:19,916
at the moment.


241
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,666
So you should take
this into account


242
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,526
when you're planning
your marketing strategy.


243
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:28,826
If you're only serving your
app to, say, the states,


244
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,706
then maybe you should consider
serving to other regions


245
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:35,516
because these regions will
also be sending ad requests,


246
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,326
but not getting anything back.


247
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:39,676
Or they might not even have
the app available in the store.


248
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,946
So really consider where
you're submitting your app,


249
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,636
to which stores, and take


250
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,326
into account these iAd
App Network countries.


251
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:48,496
One thing that you can do


252
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:51,456
with this is target your
marketing to those countries.


253
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,376
So if you've never thought
about advertising specifically


254
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,126
to a particular country, maybe
you should try doing that?


255
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:59,556
That will increase the number
of customers in that country,


256
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,756
and really drive up
those ad requests,


257
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,456
and assist with optimizing
the ad performance


258
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:05,366
of your application.


259
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,096
You could even consider
going a step further


260
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:10,446
and localizing your
applications.


261
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,446
The last country that we rolled


262
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:15,476
out the iAd App Network
to was Mexico.


263
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,106
It's right next door and
you could localize our app


264
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,676
in Spanish, and immediately
get access to a whole bunch


265
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,296
of customers that you would
never have had access to before.


266
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:29,016
Driving up ad requests,
impressions, Tap Throughs,


267
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:31,186
and improving your
app performance.


268
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:34,386
Another thing that you need


269
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:38,006
to consider is the
seasonality of advertising.


270
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,816
Consumer spending throughout
the year fluctuates,


271
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,776
so as does advertising spending.


272
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:48,176
Advertising spending kind of
tracks consumer spending, right?


273
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,866
So you should also
market accordingly.


274
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,646
If you know that there's going
to be a holiday period coming


275
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,716
up where spending is
going to be increased,


276
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,266
maybe you should focus
your marketing attention


277
00:12:58,456 --> 00:12:59,706
to that time of the year.


278
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,466
Increase a little bit of
your marketing budget,


279
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:05,346
get some more customers into
your apps at that point in time,


280
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:10,846
and then you'll get more
requests at that time.


281
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:13,546
And, I guess the one
thing to take away


282
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,516
from this is it's a very,
it's a feedback loop.


283
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:20,416
As you drive more customers
to your app, you're going


284
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,546
to get more ad requests, which
are going to result in more ads,


285
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:26,986
which in turn turns into
impressions, and Tap Throughs,


286
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,716
and the iAd App Network
will use all of these things


287
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:32,386
to decide should I send
more ads to this app?


288
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:34,416
How many ads should
I send to this app?


289
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:38,486
So a really healthy
app is one that works


290
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,776
with this feedback loop that
really drives as many customers


291
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:45,636
as possible, creates
loyalty, and gets more ads.


292
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:49,676
So that's a little bit about
optimizing ad performance.


293
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,316
You might be wondering, well how
do I join the iAd App Network?


294
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:55,906
It's pretty easy.


295
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:59,766
If you've submitted an app
before, you would have gone


296
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,396
to the iTunes Connect website,


297
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:05,936
so the iAd preferences
configured in the same place.


298
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,526
All you need to do is
complete the iAd contract once.


299
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,596
And then on a per app basis,


300
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:15,416
you need to enable iAd
specifically for that app.


301
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:17,276
One thing to bear in
mind is that you need


302
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:18,996
to do this before
you submit your app.


303
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,526
So before you've finished
developing your app


304
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:25,466
and maybe you want to
create the descriptions


305
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,836
and the screenshots, and so
on, the App Store details


306
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:32,126
for your app, make sure you
enable iAd before you submit the


307
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,516
binary for our application.


308
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:39,266
So that's a little bit about
joining the iAd App Network.


309
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,626
Let's dig in to some of
the developer details


310
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:45,136
about integrating apps
into your application.


311
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,626
And to start with,
what we're going


312
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,856
to do is talk about banners.


313
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:55,616
The banner ad is a
slim device with view.


314
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:57,726
Sits at the bottom
of your content view.


315
00:14:58,676 --> 00:14:59,836
And you can see one here.


316
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:03,386
It's typically a place at
the bottom of your content,


317
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:06,886
but remember back to the smart
placement bit of the talk


318
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,476
where you can adjust this
depending on music context


319
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,026
to avoid accidental
taps, but our guidance is


320
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,286
that it generally goes to
the bottom of the content.


321
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:21,976
As new ads become available,
the banner continuously loads,


322
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:26,146
so if your user passes out of
network access and comes back


323
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:29,536
into network access, these
banners will automatically bring


324
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:32,256
in new ads, and roll on and
off the screen automatically.


325
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:35,526
When you tap one
of these banners,


326
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:37,966
you get a full screen
immersive ad experience.


327
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:41,716
And lastly these
banner ads are supported


328
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,386
on both iPhone and iPad.


329
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,696
So you can use them
in both contexts.


330
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:49,446
To integrate these banners,
there's three easy steps.


331
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:53,826
First you need to link the iAd
framework, which is pretty easy.


332
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:55,586
We're going to get a
demonstration of that soon.


333
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:58,936
You need to import the iAd
header from the framework.


334
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:02,916
And lastly, you need to
choose the view controllers


335
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:07,106
in your application that are
appropriate for advertising.


336
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,476
So what I mentioned
before, that you had an app


337
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:12,906
with the banner view
across the bottom,


338
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,196
you should consider each
screen of your application


339
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:21,016
as being appropriate or
inappropriate to the banner ads.


340
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,966
And we've got this new API
and iOS 7 that allows you


341
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,746
to set a flag on any of your
View Controllers to say,


342
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,606
I would like banner
ads to be displayed


343
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,046
in this View Controller.


344
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,946
So we set the canDislayBannerAds
property to yes.


345
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:39,096
And what this does is
it takes the root view,


346
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:42,886
or the top level view
of your View Controller,


347
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,866
and it becomes the
originalContentView.


348
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:47,306
It becomes a mute property.


349
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:52,176
This allows us to wrap
your View Controller's view


350
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,056
in a Framework View which
allows us to animate the banner


351
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,216
on and off the screen.


352
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:01,536
So when you sent the
canDisplayBannerAds property


353
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:04,935
to yes, we wrap your
view in another view.


354
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:09,136
We start sending ad requests
to the network saying we would


355
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:12,596
like banner ads for
this particular device.


356
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,906
When the banner loads, so we
get an ad back from the network,


357
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:20,396
the banner moves on
screen, adjusting the size


358
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:21,886
of your original content view.


359
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,665
So the one thing you
need to keep in mind is


360
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:28,006
if you're referring to that
original view, you now need


361
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,646
to change all of your calls to
view on your View Controller


362
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,096
to originalContentView.


363
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:33,696
And you also need to make sure


364
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,076
that your originalContentView
respects Relay Out,


365
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:39,826
accommodating a new banner ad.


366
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:42,976
Once the banner is
on the screen,


367
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:46,166
the user has an opportunity
to tap on it.


368
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,096
So we get that full screen
ad experience on tap.


369
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,526
When the ad appears
on the screen,


370
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:54,466
you get the usual appearance
and disappearance callbacks


371
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,456
on your View Controller.


372
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,456
So what you should do


373
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:01,186
in the viewWillDisappear
callback is poise


374
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:05,016
and intensive media
activities, sounds, and so on,


375
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,166
that would interrupt
with the ad experience.


376
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:10,766
Because your goal is to have the
user enjoy the ad experience,


377
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:14,176
and not feel like the
app is using up CPU,


378
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,156
slowing things down, because
that disrupts the ad experience.


379
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:22,136
When the full screen
advertisement is dismissed,


380
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:26,176
then this is a good time to
resume any immediate activity


381
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,526
that you had running
in your app.


382
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,036
So now we've got
an ad on screen.


383
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:34,326
The user passes out of
network connectivity,


384
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,846
or there's no longer
ad Inventory available


385
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:39,566
to your app, the ad unloads.


386
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:41,426
So when the ad unloads,


387
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:44,646
the banner is moved off-screen
automatically by the framework,


388
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:48,456
and your original content view
is resized much in the same way


389
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:53,586
as it was resized when it
was bought on the screen.


390
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,976
So you've got these
View Controllers


391
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,296
and they're all configured,
or some of them are configured


392
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:58,876
with canDislayBannerAds.


393
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,426
There are certain circumstances


394
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,236
where you want a
temporarily disable banner ads


395
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,836
on a particular View Controller.


396
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:07,406
So we support that as well.


397
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:11,046
You simply need to set
the property back to No.


398
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:14,136
And when you're finished
with the app context,


399
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,696
where it's inappropriate for
a banner ad to be displayed,


400
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:22,256
or not ideal for a banner ad to
be displayed, then you can set


401
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,936
that property back to Yes.


402
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,496
Don't forget to re-enable.


403
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:33,726
Yes. We provide some great tools
for testing during development.


404
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:36,406
In the Developer Settings
pane on the device,


405
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:39,326
we have these two
great facilities


406
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,046
for adjusting the Fill Rate,


407
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:43,156
which we mentioned
in the core concepts.


408
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,716
This allows you to
configure your application


409
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,256
so that it never gets ads.


410
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:51,066
It always gets ads or
some variation in between.


411
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:54,516
This is as this was with
testing of your app.


412
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,076
You can also adjust
the Refresh Rate.


413
00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:01,136
So this is how quickly ads cycle
in and out of your application.


414
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:03,526
One thing to bear in mind is


415
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,536
that this only affects
your apps.


416
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,226
So if you're carrying
a development device


417
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:11,166
and you total these Fill Rate
and Refresh Rate settings,


418
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:15,266
and then you run another
person's app from the store


419
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,896
that has iAds, it's not
going to affect the Fill Rate


420
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:19,276
and Refresh Rate of that app.


421
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:23,156
It's only apps that are
installed by you as a developer.


422
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:27,916
I'd like to bring
up David Wilson


423
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,596
to give us a demonstration
of how


424
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,346
to integrate banner ads
into our application.


425
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,846
>> David Wilson: So now that
we've talked about banner ads,


426
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:36,696
we're going to take a quick look
at a demo, just how easy it is


427
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:38,326
to take an existing application


428
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,086
and add this functionality
to it.


429
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,746
To do that, we're going to start
off with a simple application.


430
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,136
It's just two View Controllers.


431
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:45,926
It's a master detail.


432
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,456
The first one's going to show
a list of article headlines,


433
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:50,976
and when you tap on one of those
article headlines, you're going


434
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,296
to go into New View
Controller that shows


435
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:54,706
that article in a web view.


436
00:20:54,706 --> 00:20:58,176
What we want to do in the
first part of this demo is


437
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:02,516
to add a banner view to the
bottom of the list of articles.


438
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:07,396
So I'm going to go ahead and
pop open the iOS Simulator here,


439
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:10,456
and this is the application
before we started doing anything


440
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:10,806
to it.


441
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:14,596
We've got top news here,
a list of quick articles.


442
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:17,316
We can click on one of these and
we've got ourselves an article.


443
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,276
So let's see what we need to do


444
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,746
to add iAd Support
to this application.


445
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:23,986
We're going to hide
this, go back,


446
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,206
to Xcode to bring
up our project.


447
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:28,486
And the first thing that
we need to do is link


448
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:29,736
against the iAd framework.


449
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:32,066
So we're going to make sure
we've got our project selected.


450
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:34,036
Select the appropriate
target here.


451
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:35,676
And go over the Build
Phases Tab.


452
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:37,806
Click the Plus Button.


453
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:40,356
We can find the iAd Framework.


454
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,916
And go ahead and add
that to our project.


455
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,196
The next thing that
we need to do is go


456
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:52,786
into our Master View Controller
here and Import the iAd Header.


457
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,306
That gives us access to the API,


458
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,076
specifically the
CanDislayBannerAds Property


459
00:21:57,436 --> 00:21:58,426
on View Controller.


460
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,116
Once we've done that, all we
need to do is set that property


461
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,746
on the View Controller
when it wakes up.


462
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:08,196
We can go ahead and save.


463
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:12,526
We can re-run our demo here.


464
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,576
Now you'll see that
automatically.


465
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,496
An ad pops in from the bottom as
soon as the ad request is made,


466
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:24,556
and a new ad has loaded
into your application.


467
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:29,406
If we were to lose network
connectivity and this were


468
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:32,436
to cycle back out, you'd see it
just animate out smoothly just


469
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,086
as well as it animated in.


470
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:38,836
And with that, I'll bring Nathan
back up to continue the slides.


471
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:39,806
>> Nathan de Vries:
Thanks, David.


472
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:43,216
As you can see, it's pretty
easy to enable banner ads.


473
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:45,206
Just a simple property.


474
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,246
Very easy to do.


475
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:47,756
Pretty cool.


476
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,276
This is new in iOS 7.


477
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,246
So next we're going to talk
about a different type of ad.


478
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:54,656
We've seen a banner
ad which when tapped,


479
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:56,816
presents a full screen
advertisement.


480
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,896
The Interstitial is a
little bit different,


481
00:22:58,896 --> 00:22:59,826
in that it doesn't have


482
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:02,326
that intermediary
view that you tap on.


483
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:06,376
It immediately launches into
a full-screen advertisement.


484
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,826
So what usually happens
is, as you're transitioning


485
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:12,806
from one part of your
application into another part,


486
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:16,496
you get this full-screen
advertisement up here.


487
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,946
So this is pretty cool.


488
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:24,426
This has been available since
iOS 4.3 on iPad, as of iOS 7,


489
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:26,966
this is all also
available on the iPhone,


490
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,236
so you can start using
this today on iPhone too.


491
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:35,076
Now when I talk about
automatic presentation


492
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:37,496
of a full-screen view,
when does that happen?


493
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:40,716
As of iOS 7, we now
have this new property


494
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,966
on View Controller
similar to the property


495
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:46,836
on the banner ads
called the Interstitial


496
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:48,096
Presentation Policy.


497
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:52,376
And what the iAd framework is
now able to do for you is watch


498
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:54,696
for View Controllers
to become visible,


499
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:57,556
and then present an
interstitial ad automatically


500
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,336
when that view becomes visible.


501
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,586
So if you've got
a view controller,


502
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:04,166
we can say there's two
View Controllers here;


503
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,086
one is off-screen, the current
View Controller on-screen,


504
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:08,866
and the next View
Controller off-screen.


505
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:12,136
We want to configure the
Interstitial Presentation Policy


506
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:14,886
of the next View
Controller to be automatic.


507
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:16,356
We want the iAd framework


508
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:18,926
to automatically manage
presentation of an interstitial


509
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:24,066
when it's appropriate based
on inventory and minimum time


510
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,776
between interstitial
presentations.


511
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:29,426
Now when we call
pushViewController to present


512
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,426
that View Controller,


513
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,306
an interstitial is
automatically presented on top.


514
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:38,886
When the user dismisses the
full-screen interstitial,


515
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:40,916
they're back to that
next View Controller.


516
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:43,326
They're back into the app.


517
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:46,466
There's also another option for
applications that are doing,


518
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,366
maybe single View
Controller style,


519
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:51,456
have the single View
Controller architecture.


520
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:55,266
Things like games, where
you need to have control


521
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:56,806
over the presentation
of the interstitial


522
00:24:56,806 --> 00:25:00,006
because there's no View
Controller transitions.


523
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:02,126
So what you need to
do there is instead


524
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,366
of setting an automatic
Interstitial Presentation


525
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:07,316
Policy, you set a Manual
Presentation Policy.


526
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:10,476
And what this does, is it
still enables interstitials


527
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,286
to present automatically
and seamlessly, but you need


528
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:15,106
to request the presentation.


529
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:18,556
So if you're building a
game style application,


530
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:22,186
when you transition
from, say, the game back


531
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,476
into the menu would
be one example.


532
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:27,036
You can call Request
Interstitial Presentation,


533
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:31,936
and if an ad is available,
it will present.


534
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:34,396
One thing to bear in mind
with interstitial ads is


535
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:38,176
that when you're setting this
property on View Controllers


536
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:40,146
that might happen quite a while


537
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:42,006
after the user has
launched the application.


538
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,226
Setting the property on a View
Controller is really the only


539
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:47,356
way for the iAd framework
to know


540
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:49,706
that ad requests
should stop being sent


541
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,116
to the iAd App Network.


542
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,336
So what you can do
to improve on this is


543
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:57,976
to call Prepare Interstitial
Ads early


544
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:59,786
on in your application's
lifecycle


545
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:02,216
so that you don't miss
those early impressions.


546
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:05,546
And with that, I'm going


547
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,516
to bring David back
up to do a demo.


548
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:08,066
>> David Wilson: Okay.


549
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:08,766
So we're going to go back


550
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,606
to the application we
just took a look at,


551
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:13,016
and we added a banner view
to the bottom of the list


552
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:15,846
of articles, and now we want to
add interstitial presentation


553
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:18,586
when the user taps on one
of those articles to go


554
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:19,986
into the actual article view.


555
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:22,966
We can go back, remember, and
this is what our app looked


556
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,556
like when we last left it.


557
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:26,226
We've got ads at the
bottom, and you can see


558
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:27,186
that they're cycling there.


559
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:29,876
We can go back to Xcode.


560
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:33,386
Now as Nathan mentioned,
it's important to tell iAd


561
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:37,286
that you're going to want to
present interstitial as early


562
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:39,036
as possible in the
app's lifecycle.


563
00:26:39,486 --> 00:26:43,576
That allows iAd to go ahead and
make ad requests on your behalf


564
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:46,976
so that an interstitial is ready
when the user takes the action


565
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:48,756
that would present it.


566
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,316
So the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to go


567
00:26:51,316 --> 00:26:53,076
over to our app delegate.


568
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:57,536
We're going to import
the iAd Header here,


569
00:26:57,536 --> 00:27:00,866
and then inside our app
delegates did finish launching


570
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,186
with Options Call.


571
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:04,836
We want to go ahead and
call UI View Controller,


572
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:06,626
Prepare Interstitial Ads.


573
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:10,926
This allows iAd to begin
making those ad requests


574
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,626
at the beginning of
your application.


575
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,936
That means the moment
the user takes action,


576
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,876
we're going to have
ads available for you.


577
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,846
Once we've done that,
we can go back


578
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,356
to our Master View
Controller here,


579
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:23,586
and we've already
imported the iAd Header,


580
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:24,746
which was the important bit.


581
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:29,326
And we go down to the bottom
of this to prepare for segue.


582
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:32,026
Here we've set up our
Detail View Controller.


583
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:34,176
We've set the Article URL on it.


584
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,546
And once we've done
that, we just also need


585
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:37,926
to set one more property,


586
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,686
which is the Interstitial
Presentation Policy.


587
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,026
And once we've done
that, we can save again.


588
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:46,916
We can go ahead and Run.


589
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,076
Okay. So we've got our
application back up.


590
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:57,066
Give it a second and the
banner should kick in here.


591
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,646
And then behind the scenes,


592
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,176
we're also making
interstitial requests


593
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:04,216
which we'll be loading
an ad for us.


594
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:09,136
Note that the default
fill rate for development


595
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:10,606
of the application is 80%.


596
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,946
You will want to change
that again as Nathan pointed


597
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:17,596
out if you want to test things
work all the time, versus never,


598
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,856
go ahead and click on one


599
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:26,626
of the articles here,
and not get an ad.


600
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,616
We got one down there.


601
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:30,196
There we go.


602
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,556
So the user's tapped on
the article headline.


603
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:33,696
They've gone in the
article view,


604
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:37,286
and the full-screen ad has
presented over the article view.


605
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,476
Once the user has finished
engaging with this ad,


606
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:45,276
they can go ahead and close that
ad, and they're back immediately


607
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:46,276
into your View Controller.


608
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:50,086
And with that, I'll bring Nathan
back up to continue the slides.


609
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:51,416
>> Nathan de Vries: So simply,


610
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,546
setting the Interstitial
Presentation Policy


611
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:54,696
on your View Controllers,


612
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,146
and you get this
automatic view controller


613
00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:58,486
interstitial presentation.


614
00:28:58,806 --> 00:28:59,566
It's pretty easy.


615
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:01,316
Pretty easy to get started.


616
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:04,286
So next we're going to look


617
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:09,416
at this ad type called the IAB
Medium Rectangle Advertisement.


618
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,286
So what is this?


619
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:16,406
It's a view that's very similar
to a banner view, except instead


620
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,496
of being positioned at the
bottom of your content,


621
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,466
it's positioned in-line
with your content.


622
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:24,586
The size of this
view is prescribed


623
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,596
by the Interactive
Advertising Viewer,


624
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:30,726
which is why it's called the
Medium Rectangle Advertisement.


625
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,536
You might have seen
this on websites.


626
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:36,306
It's 250 points by 300 points.


627
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,336
It also has a similar cycling
behavior as the banner view,


628
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:44,556
so as new ads become available,
the ad cycle in the view.


629
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:49,446
And, again, like
the banner content,


630
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:53,066
you also get full
screen ads on tap.


631
00:29:53,736 --> 00:29:56,636
This was introduced
in iOS 6 [inaudible],


632
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:59,406
and it's available only on iPad.


633
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,896
So how do we create
one of these things?


634
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,496
As you noticed, it
was positioned in-line


635
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,686
in the content, so you have
this greater flexibility


636
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:10,706
and positioning of the
view within your content.


637
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:15,076
So to do that, we need to
create this banner view


638
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,366
of type medium rectangle.


639
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:20,976
So here you can see after we've
imported the headers like we did


640
00:30:20,976 --> 00:30:23,806
for the banner view, we
created this new banner view


641
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:25,546
of type medium rectangle.


642
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:30,526
And this is going to create
nearly unloaded medium


643
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:31,626
rectangle view.


644
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:35,316
So we also need to configure
ourselves as the delegate


645
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:38,146
of this view because
as ads become available


646
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:43,376
and unavailable inside this
banner view, we need to be told


647
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:45,916
so we know when to
present the view onscreen


648
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:46,956
and take it off screen.


649
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:49,006
So we set ourselves
as the delegate,


650
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:51,706
and the protocol
that's used to talk


651
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:54,996
to that delegate is the 80
Banner View Delegate protocol.


652
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:57,816
So whichever object you've
assigned as the delegate needs


653
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,366
to conform to the 80 Banner
View Delegate protocol.


654
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:01,596
So we do that as well.


655
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:05,356
When the banner is
ready to load,


656
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:06,886
so we get this Delegate
Callback.


657
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:10,126
That callback is called the
Banner View Did Load Callback.


658
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:11,316
Called on the delegate.


659
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,916
And when this happens,
that's an opportunity for you


660
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,286
to present the ad on screen.


661
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:18,686
We now have an ad
fulfilled by an ad request.


662
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:21,016
We now have an ad
fulfilled by an ad request.


663
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:23,096
We now need to turn
that into an impression.


664
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:27,186
So to do that, you can do your
custom layout however you would


665
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,326
like to present that view.


666
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:32,926
You could cross-fade it in,
readjust your other views,


667
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:36,146
and present that medium
rectangle ad in-line


668
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:36,916
with your content.


669
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:43,886
Similarly to banner ads, when
the medium rectangle is tapped,


670
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,636
you get the full-screen ad.


671
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,846
You also need to use
the view will disappear


672
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:52,826
and view will appear callbacks
to pause any activity and sounds


673
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:57,326
in your application to prevent
them clashing with any sounds


674
00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:01,126
and media that are
being played in the ad.


675
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:04,406
When it comes time to unload
that medium rectangle,


676
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:06,186
the next callback you'll receive


677
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:09,586
on our Delegate is called the
bannerviewdidFailToReceiveAd


678
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:10,846
with Error Callback.


679
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:14,486
And this is an opportunity for
you to remove due to the reverse


680
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:16,836
of adding the view to the
view hierarchy, and you want


681
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,106
to move it off screen.


682
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:20,126
It's important to
keep in mind here


683
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:25,736
that you shouldn't just throw
away the medium rects ad view


684
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:27,446
because you can just
keep it around.


685
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,546
It'll continue to
cycle with new ads.


686
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:32,576
So as those new ads
become available,


687
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:36,636
you can simply add the same
medium rectangle ad view back


688
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:38,496
to your views hierarchy.


689
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:44,146
So much like banner
ads, we have some tools


690
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:46,486
for testing medium rectangles.


691
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:48,916
We still have the
adjustments to fill rate.


692
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,746
They also work with
these medium recs.


693
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:52,766
We have adjustments
to refresh rate.


694
00:32:52,986 --> 00:32:54,386
Same as we discussed before.


695
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:59,216
But there's another additional
toggle that you can flip used


696
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:02,446
for medium rectangles because
you're positioning them often


697
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:04,666
in very specific ways
in line with content,


698
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:09,316
and what that switch does is
it helps you avoid any clipping


699
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:10,416
of that ad view.


700
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,416
So we really want to
avoid clipping the ad view


701
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:16,256
because that can prevent the
user from being able to see it


702
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:17,566
or the user being
able to tap it,


703
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:20,456
so by flipping the
highlight clipped banners,


704
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:24,336
you get these overlaid
red or green views on top


705
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,126
of your medium rects to show
whether it's being clipped


706
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:27,406
or not.


707
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:31,016
So make sure that you
run your application


708
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,996
with this flag enabled
in Settings


709
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:36,406
to make sure your medium
rects aren't being clipped.


710
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:39,676
So let's get a demo of that.


711
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:40,896
>> David Wilson: Okay.


712
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:44,716
So to enter it medium rectangles


713
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:49,326
into an application is a
little more complicated,


714
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:50,246
as Nathan mentioned.


715
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,966
So to do that, we're going to
start with a new application,


716
00:33:52,966 --> 00:33:55,646
and this is sort of a
bit of a game simulation.


717
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:59,736
Most of the screen is going to
be taken up by the simulation.


718
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:00,766
There's some text at the bottom


719
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:03,756
that has some wasted white
space, and we're going to try


720
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:05,426
to take advantage of
some of that white space,


721
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:06,696
to include a medium rect


722
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:08,456
in the bottom left
corner of our screen.


723
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,025
Okay. So, anyway, you just
have to trust me that we have


724
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:14,835
as a simulation at the top, and
we have some text at the bottom,


725
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:18,045
and we've got a medium rectangle
that we're going to want to put


726
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:19,846
on the bottom left
corner of the screen.


727
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:23,896
So to do that, as we did
in our previous project,


728
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,606
the first thing we're
going to need to do is link


729
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,406
against the iAd framework.


730
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:31,315
So click on our project
here, go over to Build Phases


731
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,166
for the appropriate target.


732
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,846
Link binary with Libraries.


733
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:39,656
And we're going to link
in the iAd framework.


734
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,926
Remember this is an
iPad only feature,


735
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:46,606
so we can't actually demo
it with the iOS 7 STK today.


736
00:34:46,846 --> 00:34:51,356
But you can build applications
to run against iOS 6.1,


737
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,396
and they will work with
the next seed for iOS 7.


738
00:34:55,146 --> 00:34:57,126
Once we've linked
against the iAd framework,


739
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,526
the next thing we need to do
is go to our View Controller.


740
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,616
We're going to go ahead and
Import the iAd framework here


741
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:05,676
to give us access
to these API's.


742
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:08,506
And because we need
to have a delegate


743
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,676
for the medium rect banner view,


744
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,596
we're going to make
our View Controller


745
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:16,326
that 80 Banner View Delegate,
and then we're going to set


746
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:21,266
up a couple properties to hold
the new 80 Banner View Medium


747
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:24,216
Rect that we're going to create,
and to keep track of whether


748
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:26,396
or not the ad is
currently visible on screen.


749
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:29,046
We're going to need this so that
we can do the appropriate layout


750
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,656
as the banner view
loads and unloads.


751
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,926
So once we have those
properties inside Load View,


752
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,156
we can go ahead and
instantiate that.


753
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,946
Note that all we have to
do is alloc initWithAd:


754
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:45,146
ADAdTypeMediumRectangle,
and then remember


755
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:48,216
to set the delegate to
the View Controller.


756
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:50,776
Once we've done that, we need


757
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:53,526
to update our
viewDidLayoutSubviews method


758
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,486
so that we can include the
medium rect inside our layout.


759
00:35:57,316 --> 00:36:01,526
So all we need to do here is
do some frame calculations


760
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,136
for the medium rect,
which puts it,


761
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:06,446
with the calculations
here we're doing is layout


762
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:09,016
out the medium rect in the
bottom left of the screen


763
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:11,226
if it's loaded, and
just off-screen


764
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:13,066
in the bottom left,
if it's not loaded.


765
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,636
That allows us to do smooth
animated transitions on


766
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:19,046
and off screen, as
the loaded property


767
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,416
of this banner view changes.


768
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:23,676
To do that, we're also going
to need to adjust the origin


769
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:25,066
of the frame that's next to it.


770
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,816
Once we've done that,
then we need


771
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:30,656
to actually start implementing
the delegate method callbacks


772
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,236
that will tell us when things
happen with this banner view.


773
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:37,066
So the first thing we're going
to do is go down to the bottom


774
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:40,516
and hide the rest of this.


775
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:43,366
Then we go to first start


776
00:36:43,366 --> 00:36:46,186
out by implementing
bannerViewDidLoadAd.


777
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:50,296
This is our cue to move
the banner onscreen


778
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:51,736
if it's not already there.


779
00:36:52,256 --> 00:36:55,396
This is iAd telling us that
there's a new ad that's in place


780
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:57,196
in the view and we should
display it to the user.


781
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,376
If it's already visible,
that's fine.


782
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:01,226
We don't need to
take any action.


783
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:03,636
If it's not, we're going
to set our property here


784
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:06,316
and then we're just going
to do a quick animation


785
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:09,556
to move this thing onscreen by
just calling setNeedsLayout,


786
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:12,286
layoutIfNeeded, and letting
the layout code that we did


787
00:37:12,286 --> 00:37:14,096
up above handle this for us.


788
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:17,316
Now once the banner's been
onscreen for a little while,


789
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:20,336
we're going to have to move it
back off screen if it unloads,


790
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:23,296
say the user moves out
of network connectivity,


791
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:25,176
or we just run out of inventory.


792
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:26,746
So we're going to implement


793
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,276
in this case the
bannerViewDidFailToLoadAd


794
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:30,776
with error method.


795
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:34,276
This is almost identical
to moving it onscreen,


796
00:37:34,276 --> 00:37:36,346
except we're going to
change our property to No,


797
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:39,626
and then we're going to
again do an animation based


798
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:41,786
on setNeedsLayout,
layoutIfNeeded.


799
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:44,506
So that'll move the
thing on and off screen,


800
00:37:44,506 --> 00:37:46,306
but there's one more thing
we need to take care of,


801
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,986
and that's pausing our game


802
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:49,886
when the user actually
interacts with this ad.


803
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:51,506
We've got a simulation running.


804
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:52,776
It's taking up CPU.


805
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:54,876
Maybe the user is actually
interested in watching


806
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:57,236
that simulation, and we
don't want to let it just go


807
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:00,606
on behind the scenes while the
user's interacting with the ad.


808
00:38:01,226 --> 00:38:02,636
So to do that, we're
going to go ahead


809
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:05,496
and implement view did
appear, view did disappear


810
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:08,466
on our view controller, and
all we need to do here is start


811
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:11,066
and stop timers that are
running our simulation.


812
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,136
If you had media, this would
also be your cure to pause


813
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:15,506
and then resume the media.


814
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,356
Once we've done that,


815
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:19,856
if our demo machine were
working we could run it again,


816
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:22,636
but that's pretty much
all you need to do


817
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,056
to get medium rects
integrated into your app.


818
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:27,126
And with that I'll
bring Nathan back out.


819
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,626
>> Nathan de Vries: So the next
ad type which we're excited


820
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:32,576
to talk about today, is
the pre-roll video ad.


821
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:36,006
We've had a lot of requests for
this, and it's new to iOS 7,


822
00:38:36,506 --> 00:38:39,586
and what this lets you do
is integrate seamlessly


823
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,276
with the media player API's


824
00:38:41,506 --> 00:38:45,616
to request playback all the
video before your video content.


825
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:48,586
So as I said, it's
brand new in iOS 7.


826
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:52,036
It's integrated with
the media player API's.


827
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,486
So the way you would
normally play back media


828
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,476
with the MP movie
player controller API,


829
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:59,286
you can now just
use a different API


830
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:03,576
to play a pre-roll
ad before that media.


831
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:05,426
When the pre-roll
starts playing,


832
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:08,846
this happens before the
media content starts playing,


833
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:11,826
your primary media
content starts playing,


834
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,916
and when the advertisement
finishes,


835
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:17,406
you get this seamless transition
to the main content video.


836
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,736
If the user engages with the
video while it's displayed


837
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:22,846
with this pre-roll video,


838
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:26,356
they get that standard
full-screen immersive ad


839
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:27,546
experience as well.


840
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:29,816
Just like all of the other
advertisements we support.


841
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:33,186
We also support Inline playback.


842
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,656
So if you've got an application


843
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,716
that doesn't assume
full-screen media playback,


844
00:39:38,036 --> 00:39:40,776
then you can also use
pre-roll video in that scenario


845
00:39:40,776 --> 00:39:43,556
by using the embedded style
for MP movie player controller,


846
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:47,676
and this is supported
on both iPhone and iPad.


847
00:39:48,156 --> 00:39:50,806
So let's take a look
at how to create one


848
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,626
of these MP movie
player controllers.


849
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:56,436
In addition to the usual iAd
framework import that you need


850
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,826
to do for the other ad types,


851
00:39:58,236 --> 00:40:00,516
the MP movie player
controller functionality is


852
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:03,006
in the media player framework.


853
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,756
So you'll need to
link media player


854
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,576
and also import the
media player headers.


855
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,906
We then need to create a new
MP movie player controller,


856
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:14,106
or an MP movie player
view controller,


857
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:17,516
depending on your application,
and set the content URL


858
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,176
of that movie player controller.


859
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:21,416
This is the usual video content


860
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,296
that you would have been
playing before you started


861
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
integrating iAd.


862
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,046
After we've done that, instead
of calling the play method


863
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,506
on the movie player controller,


864
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:33,456
iAd has this new category
method called playPrerollAdWith


865
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:35,406
CompletionHandler,
which allows you


866
00:40:35,406 --> 00:40:37,916
to provide a completion
block that gets called


867
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,726
after the ad finishes, or if
there was no other ad available


868
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:44,606
at the time of requesting
a pre-roll ad.


869
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:47,646
Once you've called this API,
you can immediately add,


870
00:40:48,126 --> 00:40:52,676
so inside that handler, once
the playback has finished,


871
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:54,916
or if there wasn't a
pre-roll available,


872
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,896
that's your opportunity
to call the play API


873
00:40:57,896 --> 00:41:01,826
and play your original
video content.


874
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:04,936
Once you've called
this Play Pre-Roll Ad


875
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:06,236
with Completion Handler API,


876
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,066
you can then add the movie
player controllers view


877
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:10,266
to your view hierarchy,


878
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:13,166
or you can present the
movie player view controller


879
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:14,466
in your application.


880
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:19,226
If you've got an app that has
a scenario where you would


881
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,136
like to conditionally play
pre-roll for some users


882
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,426
and not others, or maybe you've
got some time based logic as to


883
00:41:25,426 --> 00:41:28,806
when you want to show pre-roll
ads, you can do that too.


884
00:41:29,316 --> 00:41:32,706
All you need to do is
call the play API instead


885
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:36,236
of calling the Play Pre-Roll
Ad with Completion Handler API.


886
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,966
And you can come up with your
own logic for when you do


887
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:40,726
and you don't, display
pre-roll ads,


888
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:44,566
and which situations are
optimal for your app.


889
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:49,136
Much like interstitial ads,
you also need to prepare early.


890
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,696
You need to tell
the ad framework


891
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:53,006
that it should start
sending requests as soon


892
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:55,586
as the application launches,
so that the first time


893
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:57,086
that a user taps on a video,


894
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:00,046
a pre-roll ad is more
likely to be available.


895
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:02,856
It's all about not missing
those early impressions.


896
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,806
So similarly to the
UI view controller,


897
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,446
preparing [inaudible]
ads called,


898
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:13,376
we now swap that with an MP
movie player controller prepare


899
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:14,626
pre-roll ads [inaudible].


900
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:16,676
And this will do the
same effective thing.


901
00:42:16,676 --> 00:42:18,356
It's sending off
ad requests as soon


902
00:42:18,356 --> 00:42:20,706
as your application
becomes available.


903
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:25,626
So there are a couple of gotchas


904
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,166
with the movie player
controller API.


905
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:32,046
Those of you that are already
using MP movie player controller


906
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:34,456
will need to keep in
mind that you may need


907
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:37,546
to adjust your application
to accommodate pre-roll ads.


908
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:40,826
The first thing that you
need to make sure of is


909
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:45,026
that if you're ever explicitly
playing your MP movie player


910
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:48,166
controller, you need to make
sure that that doesn't happen


911
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,046
until the completion
handler is pulled.


912
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:54,106
This is because it's the main
content starts playing while the


913
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:54,936
pre-roll is playing,


914
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:57,406
we'll immediately skip
to the main content.


915
00:42:57,996 --> 00:42:59,376
So bear that in mind.


916
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:02,686
There's two slightly indirect
times that this can happen.


917
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:06,756
Many people will observe
these two notifications


918
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:10,096
on MP movie player controller,
when the video becomes available


919
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:12,496
for playback, and also
when the first frame


920
00:43:12,496 --> 00:43:14,406
of the video is available
for display.


921
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:18,146
A lot of developers use
these and rightly so,


922
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:20,446
for playing back the media
content, but you need


923
00:43:20,446 --> 00:43:23,006
to be aware that if you
call play in response


924
00:43:23,006 --> 00:43:26,656
to these notifications, you
may skip the pre-roll adds,


925
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:28,826
so make sure that you don't
handle these notifications


926
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:33,646
until after the callback
handler is called, and likewise


927
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,196
if your customizing the UI


928
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,746
of the MP movie player
controller, which is supported.


929
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:42,396
You also need to hold off on
inserting any custom views


930
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:45,196
into the view controller's
view until after


931
00:43:45,196 --> 00:43:46,676
that completion handler
is called


932
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:50,186
because you don't want your
views colliding with any


933
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:51,216
of the pre-roll content.


934
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:55,566
And let's bring David
up for a demo of that.


935
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:57,686
>>David: To start off with
to demonstrate pre-roll adds,


936
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:01,456
we're going to start with this
very simple collection view


937
00:44:01,456 --> 00:44:02,746
application on the phone.


938
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:05,466
Just has one view controller
that's a collection of views,


939
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:09,346
and hold a set of thumbnails for
videos, and the user can tap one


940
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,766
of those thumbnails
to go into the video.


941
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:12,436
That's great.


942
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:14,206
We can go ahead and see
what that looks like.


943
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:17,506
We have a few short videos here.


944
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:21,146
We can tap one of them,
and the video plays.


945
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:22,636
What we want to do is instead


946
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:24,166
of just having the
video play immediately,


947
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,626
we want to put a pre-roll
in front of that video


948
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,396
so we can monetize
our application.


949
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:31,136
So let's take a look
at what that takes.


950
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:34,526
So we're going to
pull up Xcode again.


951
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:36,926
The first thing we need to do,


952
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:39,566
as we did in the previous
two demos, is to go ahead


953
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:41,576
and make sure we link
against the iAd framework.


954
00:44:41,756 --> 00:44:43,896
We'll go ahead and
click on our project,


955
00:44:44,046 --> 00:44:47,246
make sure the right target
is selected, build phases,


956
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:50,676
and link against
the iAd framework.


957
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:55,246
Once we've done that, just
as with the interstitials,


958
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:58,906
it's important to tell iAd early
in the application's lifecycle


959
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:00,486
that you want pre-roll ads.


960
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:03,596
This allows it to go ahead
and make requests early,


961
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,606
so that a pre-roll is available


962
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:08,276
when the user takes an
action that should show one.


963
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:10,536
So to do that, we're
going to again go


964
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:15,176
to our app delegate application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.


965
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:18,326
We're going to go ahead
and import the iAd header


966
00:45:18,726 --> 00:45:19,986
and the media player header.


967
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:24,886
This gives us access to both the
MP movie player controller class


968
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:29,276
and the prepared pre-roll ads
category that iAd adds to that.


969
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:32,136
So inside
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions,


970
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:37,026
we're just going to call MP
movie player controller prepare


971
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,376
pre-roll adds, and that
kicks off the ad requests


972
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,686
so that we can have a pre-roll
ready when the user taps


973
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:42,806
on one of our thumbnails.


974
00:45:43,516 --> 00:45:47,656
Speaking of that, we next need
to take care of actually doing


975
00:45:47,656 --> 00:45:49,676
that when the user taps
on one of the thumbnails.


976
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,686
So to do that, we're going
to go to our view controller.


977
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:54,996
We're going to go back up to
the top first, and we're going


978
00:45:54,996 --> 00:45:58,216
to import the iAd
header here as well.


979
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:00,436
We've already imported
the media player framework


980
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:02,026
since we're playing the videos.


981
00:46:02,586 --> 00:46:04,256
And then we're going to go down
to the bottom and we're going


982
00:46:04,256 --> 00:46:04,476
to go


983
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:07,676
to our collectionViewdidSelect
ItemAtIndexPath.


984
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:12,476
This is where we handled that
tap and begin playing the movie.


985
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:16,476
All we're doing at the moment is
instantiating an MP movie player


986
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:18,926
view controller and
setting the content URL,


987
00:46:19,306 --> 00:46:20,326
and then presenting it.


988
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:24,806
The only change we need to
make here is to insert a call


989
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:27,556
to play pre-roll ad
with completion handler.


990
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:31,896
A note that we're calling MPV
controller movie player play


991
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,826
inside the completion handler.


992
00:46:33,826 --> 00:46:37,206
So once the pre-roll has
finished or has failed to play,


993
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,436
we'll go ahead and
play our content.


994
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:44,666
Once we've done that, we can
go ahead and run this again.


995
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:50,436
We've launched application.


996
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:52,006
You see we've changed
almost nothing here.


997
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:54,276
We still got our
collection of videos.


998
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,696
And this time when the user
taps on one of these videos,


999
00:46:57,726 --> 00:47:00,706
if an ad is available, a
pre-roll should play before it.


1000
00:47:01,936 --> 00:47:02,656
And here we go.


1001
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:06,056
We've got these are tapped,
we've got the ad coming up,


1002
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:10,346
the ad is playing, a few seconds
later, the user will be able


1003
00:47:10,346 --> 00:47:13,766
to either watch this ad to
completion or skip through.


1004
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,416
And when that finishes,


1005
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:17,306
the video immediately
begins playing.


1006
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:21,216
And that's all it takes
to integrate pre-rolls


1007
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:22,106
into your application.


1008
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:24,366
With that, I'll bring
Nathan back up.


1009
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:25,536
>> Nathan de Vries:
So as you can see,


1010
00:47:25,536 --> 00:47:28,046
if you've already got a
movie player application,


1011
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:31,446
it's very easy to port it
across the playing pre-roll ads.


1012
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:33,326
If you don't, then
it's very easy


1013
00:47:33,326 --> 00:47:35,146
to add these experiences
to your app.


1014
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:36,976
So wrapping up a little bit,


1015
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:41,446
we have these brand new
pre-roll ads available in iOS 7.


1016
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:44,346
Some great new opportunities
for video apps


1017
00:47:44,346 --> 00:47:46,526
to produce more revenue


1018
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:48,476
from their application
with pre-roll ads.


1019
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,656
We have those medium rectangle
ads that are supported


1020
00:47:51,656 --> 00:47:54,656
on the iPad that can
be positioned in-line


1021
00:47:54,656 --> 00:47:57,636
with your content for a
more integrated experience.


1022
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:01,446
We have new interstitial
support for iPhone,


1023
00:48:01,776 --> 00:48:03,966
which is new in iOS 7.


1024
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:07,386
They're also supported on iPad.


1025
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:11,976
And lastly we have these new
banner controller API's similar


1026
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,016
to the interstitial
API's that allow you


1027
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,506
to simply toggle a switch on
your view controllers to opt


1028
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:20,256
in to advertising for
those content views.


1029
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:22,916
And lastly, we spoke
a little bit


1030
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:26,656
about optimizing your ad
performance, so when you go away


1031
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:30,476
and you're thinking about
integrating these advertisements


1032
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:33,426
into your application,
think back to these tips


1033
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:36,516
for optimizing ad performance,
placing ads smartly,


1034
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:39,336
looking at specific
regions and locales


1035
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:42,546
for the way you might want
to optimize your marketing,


1036
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:46,106
and lastly, make sure that
it all starts with the app.


1037
00:48:46,486 --> 00:48:48,676
Really focus on pleasing
your customers


1038
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,656
and you'll generate far more
revenue from your applications.


1039
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:52,466
Thank you.


1040
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:58,006

1045
00:49:10,026 --> 00:49:12,196

as I mentioned is part


1046
00:49:12,196 --> 00:49:13,266
of the developed benefits.


1047
