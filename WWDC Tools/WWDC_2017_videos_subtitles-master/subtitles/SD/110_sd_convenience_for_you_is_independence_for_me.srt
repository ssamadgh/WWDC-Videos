Thank you.

00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:30,376
Thank you very much.

00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,056
I'm glad to see you all here and


7
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:35,816
I'm very pleased to welcome you

00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,696
to today's lunchtime session,

00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:39,656
Convenience for You is

00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:40,716
Independence for Me.


11
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:43,026
So, hope some of you were able,


12
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:44,216
or many of you were able to


13
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:45,786
attend yesterday's session with


14
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:48,076

00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,816
I'm glad you enjoyed that.


18
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:55,736
So, I have to prepare you hold


19
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:56,686
onto your seats.


20
00:00:57,346 --> 00:00:59,426
Today's speaker is incredible.


21
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,756
Todd Stabelfeldt was injured at


22
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,575
an early age in an accident that


23
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:05,656
left him paralyzed.


24
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,016
Some might have considered that


25
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,706
an insurmountable obstacle.


26
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,046
Not so with Todd.


27
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:17,756
He is simply a force into


28
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:18,216
himself.


29
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:23,456
So, I found personally from


30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,336
working with him, that to know


31
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,066
him is to love him.


32
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:29,396
And I'm the only thing standing


33
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:31,196
in the way of you getting to


34
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:31,706
know Todd.


35
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,296
So please, it is my privilege to


36
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:35,806
introduce to you Todd


37
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:36,476

And a bunch of dudes with


47
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,246
enormous muscles.


48
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,096
And I'm going to assume those


49
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:06,756
are quads.


50
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,946
I have no idea how muscles even


51
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:12,166
work, OK?


52
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:14,046
So, yeah I'm Todd.


53
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:16,676
Back in the day, back in

00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:17,776
kindergarten days it was


55
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,876
Stabelface, but we promoted to

00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:20,646
Stabelfeldt.

00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:23,936
So, that's how we call it.

00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,316
What am I doing, right?


59
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:28,316
This is a moment, this is a


60
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,246
bucketlist moment for a dude.


61
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:31,966
Especially a nerd.


62
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:36,466
You know, I've years dreams


63
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,606
wouldn't that be radical to go


64
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,606
to WWDC.


65
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,826
Now, I'm actually here.


66
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:44,776

00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,106
No pun intended on that walk

111
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:23,516
after that.


112
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,876
I'm going to go ahead and show a


113
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:27,966
couple of videos today, and


114
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,046
we're going to talk a little


115
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,546
bit, and then we're going to do


116
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,346
actually a live demo.


117
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:33,386
And that's what we're going to


118
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:33,546
do.


119
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,096
So, as I sort of kick up this


120
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:37,016
next video, I'm just sort of,


121
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,236
let's sort of see some of the


122
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,566
older stuff and get a sense of


123
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,726
where we're at today, OK?


124
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,246
So, we're going to take a few


125
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,156
minutes and watch this first


126
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:44,506
vid.


127
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,656
>> Hi. I'm Todd Stabelfeldt.


128
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:04,266
I was paralyzed in 1987 due to a


129
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:04,906
gunshot wound.


130
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,326
My cousin and I were playing


131
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,286
with some guns, and


132
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:09,006
unfortunately, that resulted in


133
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,236
what's called C4 quadriplegia.


134
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:12,156
I'm able to move from my


135
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:14,036
shoulders up, and from the


136
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,246
shoulders down is essentially


137
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:16,306
gone.


138
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,926
Once you're paralyzed, you're


139
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,226
almost sort of reborn.


140
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:21,286
And you start all over again.


141
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,346
Because now you can't do


142
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,156
anything for yourself.


143
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,876
I learned quickly as a young


144
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:26,456
kid, what my life was going to


145
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,046
be all about, putting solutions


146
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:28,796
together.


147
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,526
Back then, it was really, really


148
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:32,796
crude approaches to just try to


149
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:34,636
have any shred of independence.


150
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,126
And one of the real systemic


151
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,426
problems was communication,


152
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:38,496
especially at that sort of


153
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:39,326
mobile level.


154
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,016
You know, with a spinal cord


155
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,466
injury, essentially we are


156
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,726
reduced to our voice.


157
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,866
Voice recognition has come a


158
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:46,346
long way.


159
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,426
It's been amazing.


160
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:48,276
It's been awesome.


161
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:51,186
The one piece that was always


162
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,096
missing, you had to press a


163
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:55,246
button to start.


164
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:56,626
You had to press a button to


165
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:57,606
engage.


166
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,176
So, something that was so


167
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:01,086
amazing, and always so close and


168
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,346
oh, you could taste it.


169
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,916
To me was never going to be a


170
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,776
reality, because I can't put the


171
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:08,976
button.


172
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,236
And then, something fascinating


173
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:11,546
occurred.


174
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:13,506
iOS 7 was released.


175
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,126
And in that operating system,


176
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,736
came this concept and reality


177
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:18,766
that says, hey you know what,


178
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,296
you don't have to put this


179
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:20,666
button.


180
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,656
How about you push your button.


181
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,646
Whatever the configuration that


182
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:26,426
your story is, we are adapting


183
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:28,286
our operating system around you.


184
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,416
For me, communication is a big


185
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:31,586
deal.


186
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,196
Being intendent is a big deal.


187
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,356
And when I worked with Siri for


188
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:37,936
the first time, to interact with


189
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:38,966
her and understand how she


190
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,616
works, and to create a calendar


191
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,276
appointment with a colleague and


192
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,586
then check my computer to make


193
00:06:44,586 --> 00:06:46,016
sure it was real.


194
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,276
I was blown away.


195
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,706
I mean, Apple is now touching


196
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:51,736
people at this human experience


197
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:52,706
level.


198
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,586
To be a part of texting my wife


199
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,186
without somebody else doing it.


200
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:59,136
Words, in this current language


201
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,936
do not even identify that


202
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:01,576
feeling.


203
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:09,806
[ Applause ]


204
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:14,136
>> That was a very difficult


205
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:15,836
film to create.


206
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,686
And a wonderful film to create.


207
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:20,376
And my buddy Mark McNight and I


208
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:20,936
did that.


209
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,576
It was a couple years back now.


210
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,586
But let me tell you real quick,


211
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:27,276
how I sort of got to that video.


212
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,216
Because that's where it sort of


213
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,126
explains sort of the situation.


214
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:36,216
So, I was born, now it seems


215
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,506
weird to say, a long time ago.


216
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,796
Back in the seventies, can you


217
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:40,596
believe it?


218
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:43,686
And mom, dad, sister normal


219
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:44,166
routine.


220
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,196
Grew up in a very Navy, very


221
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:48,696
southern, and very German


222
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:51,216
household; the trifecta.


223
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,186
Failure wasn't an option.


224
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:56,886
Everybody was valuable.


225
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,706
Everybody was responsible for


226
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:03,506
putting groceries on the table.


227
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,066
And you always told the truth.


228
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,576
That's the way I was brought.


229
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,636
That's the way I was raised.


230
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:10,966
Four years into my story,


231
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,146
unfortunately my dad died in a


232
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:14,846
horrific motorcycle accident.


233
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:17,636
Four years later, now in it's in


234
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,286
the eighties, mom decides to


235
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:20,706
remodel her bedroom.


236
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,176
She puts all these old antique


237
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:23,976
guns and bullets into a spare


238
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:24,436
room.


239
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,516
It was the eighties.


240
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:27,016
Come on man.


241
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:28,576
We had Bruce Willis Nakatomi


242
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,096
Building.


243
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,826
We've got little baby Sylvester


244
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:31,716
doing his thing.


245
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,936
And we had Commando, right.


246
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:35,716
WW 3 wasn't anywhere around the


247
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:36,556
corner.


248
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:37,626
Chewed my graham crackers into a


249
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:38,015
gun.


250
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:39,895
This is what we did back then.


251
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,466
So, sadly without knowing


252
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,496
anything really about guns and


253
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:44,496
how they worked, I got shot.


254
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:46,946
And that was at 8 years old.


255
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,756
Fast forward a bit more, when I


256
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,346
was a teenager, my mom got


257
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:52,856
remarried.


258
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,196
And in that process I got a dad.


259
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,346
Dan Alberts.


260
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:00,176
I got a dad.


261
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,516
And also in that acquisition of


262
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:05,496
marriage I got two brothers and


263
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:05,886
a sister.


264
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,996
That was cool.


265
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,136
I'm good with that, they call me


266
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,976
the baby, the broken baby.


267
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,716
That's what I was with the


268
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:13,326
siblings.


269
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,896
And about that time, it was like


270
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:20,796
well, what are you going to do?


271
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,396
My mom made it very clear, you


272
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:24,776
have until the age of 20.


273
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:27,306
You have to be out of the house.


274
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,316
She was going to give me two


275
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,206
years of the grace.


276
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,476
She called it tough love.


277
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,346
I either needed to be in


278
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,016
college, or I needed to have a


279
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:37,866
job, but that she didn't shoot


280
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:38,076
me.


281
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:40,876
I got shot.


282
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:43,706
Some might say today that might


283
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:46,136
be a little weird and tough.


284
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:47,656
But it was tough love.


285
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:49,776
And it was yes ma'am, no ma'am.


286
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:52,666
And I thought, well what am I


287
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,436
going to do.


288
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,636
I always wanted to be a Navy


289
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,106
Seal.


290
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,336
I wanted to be in the Secret


291
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:57,916
Service.


292
00:09:58,956 --> 00:09:59,716
That was the plan.


293
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,686
And then my body got robbed.


294
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,216
So, what became the plan, well


295
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:06,656
I'll become a psychiatrist.


296
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:08,616
I wanted to go to med school.


297
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:09,726
I wanted to go to Berkeley.


298
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:14,406
And about that 15, 16 years of


299
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,596
age, parents sat me down, dad


300
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,716
and mom and said, hey, what are


301
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:19,586
you going to do.


302
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,366
What if something like med


303
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,476
school doesn't really work?


304
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,496
I said, OK.


305
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:27,026
You've got to have a marketable


306
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:27,756
skill son.


307
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:30,766
And I thought, well I'm not sure


308
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:31,476
what I'm going to do.


309
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,116
So, in that process of just sort


310
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,466
of being open and learning,


311
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:37,196
there was this thing called the


312
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:37,806
internet.


313
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,576
This was the mid-nineties.


314
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,576
And there was just over 100,000


315
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,316
websites.


316
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:46,326
And I begin to go to school


317
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:48,486
outside of my normal high school


318
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,016
process.


319
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,216
Actually, had to move away,


320
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:52,596
about 2.5 hours away from my


321
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:53,106
parents.


322
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,806
I had to become emancipated from


323
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:57,876
my parents as well, just because


324
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:58,946
the way some of these rules


325
00:10:58,946 --> 00:10:59,266
work.


326
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,156
And I began to go to college and


327
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,486
high school at the same time.


328
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:06,556
And at the age of 17 years old,


329
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:07,866
I was done with my associates,


330
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,826
learned software development,


331
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,026
specifically in the


332
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,286
client/server platform


333
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:13,926
relationship.


334
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:17,276
And after that it was, well, but


335
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,226
I want to go to Berkeley.


336
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,736
Well, just go get your GED and


337
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,616
then maybe you can make it


338
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:25,226
happen for you.


339
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,076
Berkeley's not going to accept a


340
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:28,206
GED.


341
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:30,696
Well, you got to get a diploma.


342
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:34,556
I got to go back to high school?


343
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:36,306
So, I ended up actually doing


344
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:36,426
that.


345
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:37,076
I don't even know the high


346
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,266
school I graduated from.


347
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,156
I know its location Renton,


348
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:40,746
Washington.


349
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,346
But I actually never stepped


350
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:43,066
foot in that school.


351
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,826
So, I graduated high school


352
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:46,776
actually after I graduated


353
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:47,256
college.


354
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,686
Exactly. Completely jacked up,


355
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:51,016
right.


356
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,846
My degree wasn't even valid


357
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,656
until high school was over with.


358
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:01,486
So, I did that and during that


359
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,306
process did I find, wow.


360
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,346
I sort of like software.


361
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,196
I like this process.


362
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:09,986
This is really interesting.


363
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:12,656
So, then began the process of


364
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:13,646
well, get a job.


365
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,286
I'm 17 years old.


366
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,306
What do I know as a 17-year-old?


367
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,696
Plus, I'm a C4 quadriplegic.


368
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:23,786
Who was going to hire a dude in


369
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:24,286
a chair?


370
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,156
Again, just, you know you look


371
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,736
back and you sort of laugh.


372
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:32,646
173 resumes sent.


373
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,086
Every single tech job in the


374
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:35,886
Seattle PI.


375
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:39,916
I did a dozen interviews or


376
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,126
more, I can't remember now.


377
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,686
But they all ended with, you're


378
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:45,066
just not the right fit.


379
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:49,066
You're just not the right fit.


380
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,796
One was, you just don't have the


381
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,996
sort of the office skills that


382
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,016
we need.


383
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,406
Yeah, you got that right, you


384
00:12:58,006 --> 00:12:59,666
know I can't staple worth crap


385
00:12:59,666 --> 00:12:59,966
you know?


386
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:01,976
I can't even pick up a damn


387
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:04,766
phone. But OK.


388
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:09,436
And I won't mention the name of


389
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:11,976
that company.


390
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,386
Then it was like, how am I going


391
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:14,526
to get a job?


392
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,806
And I remember sending a fax


393
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:20,386
through my computer.


394
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:24,026
And the modem connected at 14.4


395
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:24,526
bod [phonic].


396
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:26,776
And I went, oh, yeah.


397
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,196
This place is legit.


398
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:33,496
I sent my res, and my cove.


399
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,896
And I got hired.


400
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:37,476
This big old dude, he's 6' 7".


401
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,256
He's huge, named Steven.


402
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:41,776
My attendant knocks on the door,


403
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:42,546
opens the door.


404
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:43,906
He looks down at me.


405
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,106
I'm, I'm here to apply for the


406
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,256
software develop job.


407
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:48,616
He's like yeah come on in.


408
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,596
He had to move his office all


409
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,716
around so I could fit in his


410
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:53,876
office.


411
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,996
And he goes, how did you get


412
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:56,816
paralyzed.


413
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,386
Man, I think that's; you're not


414
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,286
supposed to say that [laughter].


415
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:03,036
That's the one rule they told me


416
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:03,776
they wouldn't do.


417
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,646
That's the first, the core first


418
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,186
question.


419
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,006
Second question, how much money


420
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:11,446
you want?


421
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:14,206
Well, they told me I could make


422
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:15,456
50 grand coming out of the


423
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:15,926
school.


424
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:16,946
No, you ain't going to make that


425
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:17,286
here.


426
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,976
Well, what do you want?


427
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:21,706
How about 25?


428
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:23,166
OK, sounds good.


429
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,646
I think I was 18 for about five


430
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:27,146
days.


431
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:30,566
I had no idea what I was doing.


432
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:31,916
Two days later got my job.


433
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:35,226
So, I'm 18 years old.


434
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:37,306
I'm working as a software


435
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:39,146
developer for a medical company.


436
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,136
Serving in the industry called


437
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:41,866
pathology.


438
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,706
Think of blood, think of sputum,


439
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,886
think of autopsies, right?


440
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,176
Things removed from the body.


441
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,946
And I begin my career as a


442
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:52,836
software developer.


443
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,736
About a year later, maybe 2


444
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:01,596
years later something profound


445
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:02,016
hit me.


446
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,136
I'm wanted.


447
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:09,116
I'm valued.


448
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,576
I have purpose.


449
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,196
Now, I can only speak of my


450
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,696
story folks, but man you give a


451
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,176
man respect and you give man


452
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,316
purpose, that man is going to


453
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:20,656
do.


454
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:25,956
And he's going to do it right.


455
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:28,906
At that same time, as always,


456
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,406
did the government come by and


457
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:34,146
say hey, Todd, no more Social


458
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,146
Services for you.


459
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:38,696
And I'm like well, yeah but I've


460
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:40,966
got to; you've got a job.


461
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:43,356
Yeah, but I'm not like, I've


462
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:44,866
still got a lot to go.


463
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:45,916
No, you're done.


464
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:47,056
You either got a job or you


465
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:47,366
don't.


466
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:50,346
So, they pulled the funds.


467
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:53,366
I had to go to my boss and say


468
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:54,396
man I've got to make a lot more


469
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:55,436
than 25K.


470
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,216
He said, no problem.


471
00:15:59,796 --> 00:15:59,906
Done.


472
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:03,186
What? Why couldn't we do this


473
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,606
two years ago [laughter]?


474
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:09,976
Later he told me he took


475
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:14,176
advantage of me because of my


476
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:15,476
disability [laughter].


477
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,706
Ain't that tight.


478
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,746
Man, way to go Steve.


479
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,106
Mad respect.


480
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,296
I learned a ton from that dude.


481
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:24,836
I worked for that company for


482
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:25,386
years.


483
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:30,586
And I loved every minute of it.


484
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:33,086
I worked 24 hours a day, 7 days


485
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:33,556
a week.


486
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,316
I was mad sipping and puffing on


487
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:37,976
that software.


488
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,336
Just hitting it hard.


489
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:42,986
Fell in love with databases.


490
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,706
Every aspect of the Microsoft


491
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:46,416
SQL database.


492
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,686
Hope I can say Microsoft.


493
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:48,476
I just did.


494
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,596
Legit. Hardware, software the


495
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,506
marriage of ray to rays.


496
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,756
Straight up hard core nerd.


497
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:02,806
But, I don't know after about 15


498
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:05,175
years, you tend to get the, I


499
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,935
want to be an employer, I'm an


500
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:08,786
entrepreneur.


501
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:09,976
I don't know if I want to be


502
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,106
that employee anymore.


503
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:14,955
One thing leads to another and


504
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,626
it looks like I'm about to make


505
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,326
my exit.


506
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,106
And this really, really cool


507
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,465
lady named Judith, my lateral,


508
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:32,266
diagnosed with stage IV.


509
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,586
Move from the chest to the


510
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,276
brain.


511
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:38,366
A few months before she exited


512
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:43,116
her earth suit, she told me I


513
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:45,936
had to bounce.


514
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,296
You better leave that job, T.


515
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,676
You were made for something


516
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,096
different.


517
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:59,806
So, she died.


518
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:00,606
And I quit.


519
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,286
And I did the one thing my


520
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:04,846
parents never told me, they


521
00:18:04,846 --> 00:18:07,086
never said to do you quit a job


522
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,116
before you got another job,


523
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:08,876
you've got a problem.


524
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:12,156
And I straight up did.


525
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,346
What am I going to do now?


526
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,936
No problem, we'll be a comedian.


527
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,446
I'm going to write books, I'm


528
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,526
going to blog.


529
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:24,596
T, you better not do


530
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:25,476
punctuation.


531
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:28,036
I'm doing a good day if I


532
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:29,176
putting a full sentence together


533
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:29,616
folks.


534
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:32,226
And I don't think my jokes are


535
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:32,746
too funny.


536
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:35,476
So, I made this business called


537
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,296
C4 consulting to make fun of my


538
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:38,006
disability.


539
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:39,956
I'm like ha ha.


540
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,896
I can do this.


541
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,586
Come to find out, that's not so


542
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:46,096
marketable.


543
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:49,676
Someone said to me, what's your


544
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:51,006
marketable skill, bro.


545
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,386
What you going to do for a job?


546
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:54,426
You all got to put groceries on


547
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:54,896
the table.


548
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,916
You know how it is.


549
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,356
I love databases.


550
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,076
Well, go be a DBA.


551
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:00,906
All right cool.


552
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:04,336
So, C4 consulting became a DBA


553
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:06,446
service, subscription model.


554
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,886
Rent, pure play 24/7, I'll be


555
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,436
your DBA to the end.


556
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,726
What's the name of your company?


557
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,866
C4. Wait a minute T, you going


558
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,736
to be a DBA but your company is


559
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:21,186
called C4?


560
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:22,356
That's an explosive [laughter].


561
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,526
Yeah, that cool?


562
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,806
You want to hire me?


563
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:30,646
I hope I don't blow it up.


564
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,426
And they did.


565
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,726
About that same time did I need


566
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:41,206
to go a wedding.


567
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,736
And I asked one of my staff, I


568
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:49,806
said I don't want to go to this


569
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:52,036
wedding, I'm crying like a baby


570
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,246
right now because it's real.


571
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,956
And she says to me, well who do


572
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,376
you want to go with?


573
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,086
I don't want to take an


574
00:19:59,086 --> 00:19:59,756

00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,136
I want to take a woman, and if


578
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,446
she's hot that'd be great.


579
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,256
You know Karen?


580
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:11,426
Who's Karen?


581
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:14,546
Then I met Karen.


582
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:20,266
And I fell in love with her the


583
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:22,176

584
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,706
And what was cool was she did


585
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:26,116
the same.


586
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,646
And we went to that wedding and


587
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,216

592
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:42,866
says, hey, she's laughing at all


593
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,736
your jokes.


594
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:46,396

So, Karen comes back and I'm


604

blown away, she got some bread,


605

606
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,606
more butter on the piece of

618

00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:38,346
>> So, that began this race of


760
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:40,086
switch control.


761
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:40,816
Switch control.


762
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,306
Independence buttons.


763
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:44,226
Joysticks, sip-and-pulls, head


764
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:44,676
raise.


765
00:26:45,296 --> 00:26:49,086
And man, did my wife and I, we


766
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:51,256
got on this like maniacal focus.


767
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,676
All day every day.


768
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:57,706
I'm on LinkedIn, friend


769
00:26:57,706 --> 00:26:59,496
requesting every Apple employee


770
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:00,206
I can find.


771
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:04,056
I'm sending that video.


772
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,686
I'm writing personal letters,


773
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:06,616
right, I'm doing a lot of


774
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:08,106
sipping and puffing, folks.


775
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:10,216
Baby girl come in, what are you


776
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:10,616
doing?


777
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:11,996
I'm finding more friends.


778
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:17,126
We were afraid it would go away.


779
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:18,386
Straight up.


780
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:20,256
And it was too precious.


781
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:21,786
It was gold.


782
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:22,596
It was a game change.


783
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:26,406
We would go to every Apple store


784
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:29,166
we could find and just mob up in


785
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:29,946
there and go, hey we got a


786
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:31,766
video, can we just pull this out


787
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:32,136
real quick?


788
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:32,696
Check this out.


789
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:33,396
I was looking at these


790
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:33,876
headphones.


791
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:38,346
You watch this video real quick?


792
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:40,616
We're on vacation to


793
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:42,016
Pennsylvania, DC.


794
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:44,336
Guess what we're doing, Apple


795
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:45,106
stores.


796
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:49,196
Right, Saturday downloads before


797
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,376
the store even opens.


798
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:55,076
We just got to make sure


799
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:57,566
everybody knows the game change.


800
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:01,316
And then we got those really


801
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:03,406
cool, sweet words, which was


802
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:08,016
Apple ain't taking switch


803
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:08,966
control away brother.


804
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:11,386
It's just going to get better.


805
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:15,136
And it was like, it was a breath


806
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:17,556
of air right there, like


807
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,586
something so good.


808
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:23,576
And then the focus changed,


809
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:26,606
which was, oh man now we got to


810
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:28,126
start telling everybody who


811
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:32,546
makes an app, everybody needs to


812
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:33,926
know how to develop these apps


813
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:34,986
with accessibility.


814
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:41,576
See, I say like this.


815
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:45,066
Apple brought me to a phone, and


816
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:49,226
they did a radical job of that.


817
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:53,116
But everybody out here in the


818
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:55,476
room, you bring me, you bring us


819
00:28:55,476 --> 00:28:56,136
to the world.


820
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:59,006
Because you all smart people in


821
00:28:59,006 --> 00:28:59,516
this room.


822
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:01,506
You got brains and you're making


823
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,066
apps.


824
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,656
And when you make an app that's


825
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:10,336
convenient for you, written in


826
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:11,966
just the manner of rightness, it


827
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,546
could be independence for me.


828
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:17,086
I'm not one person.


829
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:20,806
I'm a part of millions of


830
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:21,196
people.


831
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:32,446
So, baby girl and I, we build a


832
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:32,996
house.


833
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:35,876
We call it the quadthedral.


834
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,656
And we begin to focus and


835
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:43,976
change, how do we make sure we


836
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,496
talk to app developers, where do


837
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:46,366
we go with that?


838
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:47,876
How do we help them?


839
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,636
What do we do?


840
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:52,636
And over the last couple years


841
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:53,766
it's just demonstration.


842
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:56,196
It's a video, it's this


843
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:56,876
blogging.


844
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:58,016
It's getting more people.


845
00:29:58,786 --> 00:30:00,266
There's well over 20 people now


846
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,646
in this country that have a


847
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:03,526
setup, which I'm going to


848
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:06,976
explain to you here.


849
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,186
I'm in a wheel chair called a


850
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:10,116
Permobil F5.


851
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,566
Black on black.


852
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:13,856
West coast.


853
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:16,116
Murdered out.


854
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:22,856
this is Luis and Clark stuff


855
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:24,886
man.


856
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:26,656
Ok, cool you've got a phone on


857
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,916
your wheelchair, how is it


858
00:30:29,616 --> 00:30:33,936
charge. Well, back in the day,


859
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:35,006
and back in the day that just


860
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:36,396
means like 2 years ago.


861
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,766
This thing was plugged into a


862
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,326
you know cigarette adapter


863
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:43,216
plugged into a battery on the


864
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,076
back of the chair.


865
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:47,726
Permobil is like well maybe we


866
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:48,736
should do something different.


867
00:30:49,196 --> 00:30:50,466
Sounds good Permobil.


868
00:30:50,636 --> 00:30:54,256
So, now there's integration.


869
00:30:57,316 --> 00:31:01,146
And TechLa, the Bluetooth device


870
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,686
that pairs to the iOS.


871
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:07,796
I can do buttons which I'm going


872
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:09,236
to show you here at any second.


873
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:12,176
It was like people started


874
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:13,696
realizing, well this is legit.


875
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,096
This is real.


876
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:18,656
We need to keep moving forward.


877
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:23,396
So, now I'm going to show you


878
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:24,566
how this works.


879
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,976
You dig?


880
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:34,546
[ Applause ]


881
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:36,946
So, I use a TechLa, go for it.


882
00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:39,976
I use a TechLa and an eye device


883
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:42,676
to control my wheelchair, my


884
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:46,976
phone and everything.


885
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:47,216
All right.


886
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:49,206
So, we got that there, we got


887
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:50,436
that coming up.


888
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,346
Now you about to see my big ol'


889

hairy face.


890
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:56,286
Now, I'll tell you right now, my


891
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:57,786
company we had to do an app real


892
00:31:57,786 --> 00:31:58,976
fast, back in November.


893
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:00,626
And I don't know who puts an app


894
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:01,946
up in a month and a half, but we


895
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:02,266
did.


896
00:32:02,726 --> 00:32:04,166
And I told myself I'm going to


897
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,066
grow out my hair.


898
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:06,776
So, this right here, I'm just


899
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:07,966
going to move my mustache hair.


900
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:12,496
That's how I do it, OK

902
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,036
That's for you Felice.


903
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:19,106

There's a lot going on folks,


906

but I'm cold old school.


907
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:27,026
I'm going to call it direct

access.


909
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:28,996
So, what I'm going to do is


910
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:30,986
explain some buttons and show


911
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:31,826
you some things.


912
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:33,536

and now you just all got to


917
00:32:48,456 --> 00:32:48,946
handle it.

00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,356
