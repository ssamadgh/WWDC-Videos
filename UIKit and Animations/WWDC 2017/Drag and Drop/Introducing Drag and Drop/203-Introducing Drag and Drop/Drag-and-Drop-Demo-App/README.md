# DragBoard

This application introduces the basic concepts of drag and drop and shows how to customize some aspects of its visual appearance.

## Overview

This sample application implements a virtual pin board where the user can drag images onto it, move them around and drop them into other applications.

It also shows how easy it is to add a contextual menu to perform paste operations: in iOS 11 this is very similar to performing a drop operation.

## Getting Started

Build and run the DragBoard target.
