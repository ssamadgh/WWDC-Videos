/* 
 AssetBrowserController is a UITableViewController subclass which can be used in a number of ways.
 In particular you can use it as a modal picker style view controller, or as a single view controller
 in a navigation heirarchy. When displaying an AssetBrowserController modally, make the AssetBrowserController
 the root of a UINavigationController then present that controller modally.
 
 An AssetBrowserController can show one or multiple sources. When using AssetBrowserController
 with UITabBarContoller you may wish to use one AssetBrowserController/source per tab.
 On iPad a picker style AssetBrowserController works nicely inside a UIPopover. Some convenience
 methods are provided below.
