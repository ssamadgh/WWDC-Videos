00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,786
Alright! Good to hear!


7
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,716
So, you know the phrase,


8
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:42,216
with great power comes
great responsibility.


9
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:45,956
Right? So, you've heard that
from Spider-Man stories,


10
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:49,036
whether that's comic books
or TV shows or films,


11
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:54,116
but really the phrase connects
to all these characters up here.


12
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:57,156
Our heroes and our villains,
see the only difference


13
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,616
between our heroes and our
villains is how they decide


14
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:03,576
to respond, the choices they
make once they realize they


15
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:04,816
have power.


16
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,356
So, that's the phrase;


17
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,056
with great power comes
great responsibility.


18
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,566
And I learned that
phrase early on.


19
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,426
See, like the characters
I had moments in my life


20
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:19,526
that made me make decisions.


21
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:23,326
I was lucky, when I was very
young, when I was like four


22
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:27,166
or five, my mom let
me watch reruns


23
00:01:27,756 --> 00:01:31,486
of the 1960s Spider-Man
cartoon that was kind of made


24
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:33,266
up with panels from
the comic book.


25
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:38,016
And something about Spider-Man
just grabbed my attention.


26
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:41,666
I don't know if it was
those bright primary colors;


27
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,146
the red and the blue.


28
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,186
Perhaps it was his
big white eyes.


29
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,386
Maybe it was because
he was young and funny.


30
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,916
I don't know, but something


31
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,376
about Spider-Man
really grabbed me


32
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,946
like no other character
had before.


33
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,406
In fact, I was into him so much
I remember two years later,


34
00:01:56,406 --> 00:02:00,966
it was the book fair for my
second grade class at school,


35
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,746
and I walked in and there


36
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:06,866
against the back wall
I saw Spider-Man.


37
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,716
Not actually Spider-Man,
it was a small reprint,


38
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:13,176
a paperback sized reprint
of his comic books;


39
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,006
Amazing Spider-Man
seven through 13.


40
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,796
I never forget, and I walked up


41
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:18,046
and I grabbed it,
and I bought it.


42
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:23,166
And I read that book over
and over and over again.


43
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:26,716
And it opened my eyes
to a whole new world.


44
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,846
It introduced me to
the Marvel Universe,


45
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:32,676
and from that moment
on I was hooked.


46
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,836
That was my thing, comic books.


47
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,926
And I was one of those crazy
kids who never stopped.


48
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:41,606
I read them through grade
school, through high school,


49
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:43,546
and even through college.


50
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:49,236
And I had a pretty good
collection until the summer


51
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:53,346
between my freshman and
sophomore year at college.


52
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:56,216
It was -- I remember
it was one evening


53
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:58,856
and I saw some weird
lights out the window.


54
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:01,926
This was an apartment I was
living in with my mother,


55
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:04,816
my parents had divorced
when I was in high school.


56
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:06,466
So, I saw these weird lights.


57
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,016
I go outside and I see
that the apartment building


58
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:10,986
that we live in is on fire.


59
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:14,826
And the flames were
starting over on one side


60
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,346
and our apartment
unit was down here.


61
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,846
And as the flames started going


62
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:22,796
across the building I
was running in and out


63
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,716
of the apartment
building grabbing things


64
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,786
that I thought we
couldn't replace.


65
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:32,016
So, these were years before we
had such things as an iPhone,


66
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:36,006
I know horrible, so our
pictures were physical,


67
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,236
they were in photo albums.


68
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:39,316
So, I was running in
and out of the building,


69
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:42,396
our apartment building,
grabbing photo albums,


70
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:45,026
I was grabbing some
pieces of furniture,


71
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:48,226
pictures off the wall,
whatever I could grab


72
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:50,616
that I thought had
sentimental value.


73
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,316
And then I remember
the lights went


74
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,516
out in the building,
no more electricity.


75
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,976
And I knew I had one
more chance to go in.


76
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:03,036
So, I run in, I can't see
really, I'm feeling my way


77
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:06,606
through the apartment, down
the hallway, into my bedroom,


78
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:09,916
I open my closet door
to get one more thing


79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,036
from the apartment,
a box of comic books.


80
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:16,906
Now you might think
that's kind of crazy.


81
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,935
Why would someone run
into a building that's


82
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,526
on fire to get comic books?


83
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,576
Well, I mean at that moment
it kind of crystalized


84
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:28,886
in my mind how much the comics


85
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,836
and these characters
meant to me.


86
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,926
So, I mentioned my parents
had a divorce, and if anyone


87
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:39,106
who has been through a divorce,
or experienced it as a child,


88
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,756
you know how unsettling it is,


89
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:45,486
and it sort of rolls this
grenade into your life.


90
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:49,366
But during that, during
our moving around,


91
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:52,776
whatever was happening in
my life, and even the fire,


92
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:56,216
I had really good friends,
friends that helped me


93
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,476
through these events in my life.


94
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:01,946
And luckily those friends helped
guide me eventually to work


95
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:06,746
for Marvel, the company I dreamt
of working for ever since I was


96
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:09,046
that little kid watching
the cartoon.


97
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:13,066
And when I got to Marvel, that's
when the real learning began,


98
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:15,376
and that's when that mantra,


99
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:19,746
with great power comes great
responsibility, really sunk in.


100
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:23,566
See not only does it
apply to our characters,


101
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:26,686
and the decisions they must
make with their abilities,


102
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:30,436
it also applies to us,
the employees at Marvel.


103
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:35,036
So, we say to ourselves,
what is our power.


104
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,256
Well, our power is
we're able to work


105
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:40,866
with these amazing
characters, only we can.


106
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:45,626
Our other power is our
storytelling skills.


107
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,026
We think we're pretty good at
telling stories, whether it's


108
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:52,326
in film, or in print,
or through video games.


109
00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:54,696
That's where I work now,
as the Creative Director


110
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,576
for the Marvel Games Division.


111
00:05:57,496 --> 00:06:00,726
So, if that is our power, the
characters and the stories


112
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,656
that we tell with them,
what is our responsibility?


113
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:07,526
Well, our responsibilities
are to create stories


114
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:10,026
that in some way help people.


115
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:14,226
That connect to them,
that speak to them,


116
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:19,336
and hopefully give them
inspiration in a way


117
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:22,036
that they can then
apply it to their lives.


118
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:27,316
Now, I mentioned I had
some friends, some friends


119
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:30,686
that helped me through my
life and led me to Marvel,


120
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:33,306
and to embrace power
and responsibility.


121
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:37,606
And even though we grew
up at different times,


122
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,486
probably in different
locations around America,


123
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:44,606
and if not around the world,
I think you know my friends.


124
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,096
I think you do.


125
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:50,736
Let's see, there's six of them
I want to talk about today.


126
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:55,746
My first friend, he was a skinny
kid, he grew up in Queens,


127
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:58,376
and he really wanted to
give back to his country.


128
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,036
He wanted to serve the country,
and he thought the best way


129
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:03,916
that he could do that would
be joining the military.


130
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,736
And so he would go -- he
went to a recruitment office


131
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:07,566
and they turned him away.


132
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,156
They said he was too skinny.


133
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:10,046
He had flat feet.


134
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:10,896
They didn't want him.


135
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:13,086
But that did not
deter my friend.


136
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:15,656
He kept going to different
recruitment offices.


137
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:20,096
And there was a soldier
who was going on a mission,


138
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,506
and he went from one
recruitment office


139
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24,386
to another collecting some
papers, and he saw my friend.


140
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,846
And he said, didn't I -- I just
saw that kid at the other place.


141
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,986
And he said, to his
fellow soldiers,


142
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:32,536
that's the guy we want.


143
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:34,606
And the other one said, him?


144
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:35,276
The skinny one?


145
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:35,826
And he said, yeah.


146
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:39,666
See, it's not about
this muscle right here,


147
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:41,246
it's about this muscle.


148
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:43,466
I can see this kid has heart.


149
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,026
He's not giving up.


150
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:49,036
That's the kind of person
we want in our army.


151
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,906
So, my friend was lucky.


152
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:51,866
He succeeded.


153
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:52,426
He got in.


154
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,656
He became a soldier.


155
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,306
He not only became a soldier,
some called him a super soldier.


156
00:07:57,616 --> 00:08:00,716
In fact some call him a
living legend of World War II.


157
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:02,976
So, I guess you can guess
my first friend, right?

So, here is the cover
to his first comic.

what you would do, right?

00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:46,336
months before America was
officially entered into the war.


172
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:52,206
So, when his creators, Jack
Kirby and Joe Simon came


173
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:55,916
to work they were in trouble.


174
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:00,736
There were protesters
outside and when they got


175
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:03,156
up into the offices
of Timely Comics,


176
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,516
and that's what Marvel was
before they were Marvel,


177
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:08,846
they were called Timely,
they got up to the offices,


178
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,776
they were yelled at
by the publisher.


179
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:15,986
He said, Jack and Joe,
what are you doing?


180
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,386
You've published a comic book


181
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:22,176
with a character named
Captain America, of all things,


182
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:25,616
and he's wrapped in the
American Flag, and he's punching


183
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,816
in the face the leader
of a country


184
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,526
that we are not at war with.


185
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:31,896
What the hell are you doing?


186
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:34,616
Now, it was at that
moment someone came running


187
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,976
in from the sales department;
boss, boss, look at the numbers!


188
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:41,666
Keep doing it [laughter].


189
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:46,376
It was an immediate
hit, sold out.


190
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,956
Why? Because it was
wish fulfillment.


191
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:53,006
Jack and Joe were
using comic books


192
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:56,226
as their art form
to make a statement.


193
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,386
They were both Jewish.


194
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:01,866
They had relatives and
friends back in Europe.


195
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,966
They knew what was going on.


196
00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:06,716
They knew about the ghettos.


197
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,806
They knew about the work camps.


198
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:11,716
They knew what the
Nazis were doing


199
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:18,996
and they thought America should
go over there and stop them.


200
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:21,106
It's also important -- what
did they give Captain America?


201
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:22,106
What is he holding?


202
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:23,616
Is it a bazooka?


203
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,376
Is it a machine gun?


204
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,056
No, it's a shield.


205
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:30,976
Like I said, these
comics are an art form.


206
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,196
They send messages.


207
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:36,576
So, I think they chose a shield
because what does a shield do?


208
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:37,986
Well, it defends him.


209
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:39,796
Look, it's blocking that bullet.


210
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,736
They're saying a message
that Captain America


211
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:47,006
and America itself should
go over and protect those


212
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,486
that can't protect themselves.


213
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:50,846
So, it was a big hit.


214
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,306
But like I said, it
was controversial


215
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,446
because some felt we should
still be isolationists.


216
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,986
And why are we -- why is
he punching the leader


217
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,256
of this nation?


218
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,326
But they thought it was more
important to make the statement.


219
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,056
And that's not the last time


220
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:07,756
that we've made statements
with Captain America.


221
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:10,836
So, here we have a cover
to an issue that came


222
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,016
out just a year ago, but you
see that's someone different


223
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:14,726
in the suit, right?


224
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:17,866
So, you see above the Captain
America name, Sam Wilson,


225
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,066
The Falcon, who you may
know from the films;


226
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,036
from Captain America
Winter Soldier,


227
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:24,276
Captain America Civil War.


228
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:28,176
In the comic books
he was Cap's partner.


229
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,266
In fact there was a time,
for about 50 issues,


230
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,606
where they changed the name
of the comic book and it went


231
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:37,246
from being Captain America to
Captain America and Falcon.


232
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,526
And I know for me as a young
boy, to see a white man


233
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:45,396
and a black man, from
different backgrounds as equals,


234
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,176
working together, that
had an effect on me.


235
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,136
So, we recently did a story


236
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:53,896
where Steve's Super Soldier
Serum was running out,


237
00:11:54,576 --> 00:12:00,216
and he said to Sam, America
still needs a Captain America.


238
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:01,796
Will you take the shield?


239
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,786
Will you take over for me?


240
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,516
And we did -- and he said, yes.


241
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:10,426
We published this, and of
course we had some reactions.


242
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,636
People were not happy,
and we get it.


243
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:15,626
People feel -- why
are you messing


244
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:16,946
around with my character?


245
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:18,386
You know, you're ruining them.


246
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:19,586
Why are you changing thing?


247
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:21,876
And we even get people
saying, you know,


248
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,886
why have you turned
Captain America black?


249
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:28,686
And we had to say, well we
didn't turn Steve Rogers a


250
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:31,006
different -- make him
into a different race.


251
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:34,346
This is actually Sam
Wilson, and he's earned this.


252
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,266
He's stood behind
Captain America,


253
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:38,036
and with him, for decades.


254
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:41,336
He deserves his chance
to be Captain America.


255
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:44,486
Now why did we do this?


256
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,206
Well, we like to try different
things with our characters


257
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,556
and stretch the brand
and push the brand,


258
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,436
but we also like to say things.


259
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,116
So, I'm just thinking
in my mind,


260
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:56,246
and I don't know exactly what
the creators were saying,


261
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,696
but I think perhaps
they were saying


262
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:02,126
that it doesn't matter what
the color of your skin is,


263
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,216
if you have the heart.


264
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:08,656
If you have the heart you
can be Captain America too.


265
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:14,236
My next friend, he
was also a skinny kid.


266
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:18,706
He was from Queens as well.


267
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:21,936
He was a bit of what
you would call a nerd.


268
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,766
He was picked on by the jocks.


269
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,536
See he was really into
science, my friend.


270
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,906
And he was an orphan
and he was raised


271
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,246
by an older aunt and uncle.


272
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,006
And he really felt the
world was against him.


273
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,616
And one day his uncle said
to him, hey, when you grow


274
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,476
up you're going to have a lot of
power because -- you're smart.


275
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,286
So, when you do grow


276
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:47,726
up you should use your
powers responsibly.


277
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:50,746
And my friend kind
of said, whatever.


278
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:54,986
And when he grew up and he was
a teenager he realized he was


279
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:58,276
pretty smart and he did
have some amazing abilities,


280
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:02,176
and one night he was out and
there was a cop, police officer,


281
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,556
chasing a thief and the
cop was yelling, hey,


282
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:05,646
hey help me stop this thief.


283
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:10,256
And my friend said, from now on
I'm looking out for number one,


284
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,746
and he took a step back.


285
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,366
And that thief ran by,


286
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:16,266
and as fate would have it
two days later that thief ran


287
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:19,856
into my friend's uncle
and shot him dead.


288
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:23,706
And my friend said, if only
I'd listened to my uncle,


289
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:25,686
one of the only nice
men in my life.


290
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:28,956
If I'd listened to him
he would still be alive


291
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,616
and my aunt wouldn't be
devastated by his loss.


292
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:36,796
And from that moment forward,
as a dedication to his uncle,


293
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:39,706
he decided, I will use
my powers responsibly.


294
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,206
So, who am I talking about?


295
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:44,096
My next friend -- Spider-Man!


296
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:45,936
So, now it's 1963.


297
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:48,286
I mention that because all


298
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,356
of our creators were
using our comics to talk


299
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,346
about what's going
on around them.


300
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,756
And this was really the birth
of the Marvel Character.


301
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,726
And what do I mean by that?


302
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,646
Well, Spider-Man looked
a little different


303
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,266
than heroes that came before.


304
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,396
And once you start reading
his adventures you found


305
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,416
out he was truly different.


306
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:11,346
And his creators, Stan Lee and
Steve Ditko, they got yelled


307
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,186
at too when they came into work.


308
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,406
So, they came into work and
the publisher, Martin Goodman,


309
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:18,096
said, what are you doing?


310
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:24,726
You've published a comic with a
character named after a spider


311
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,696
and he has an insect
on his chest.


312
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,796
Everybody hates bugs.


313
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,606
What are you doing?


314
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:32,816
And you've covered his face.


315
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,506
He looks like a bank robber.


316
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,706
We can't see his face.


317
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,526
And worst of all,
he's a teenager!


318
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,016
Teenagers should be sidekicks.


319
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,416
Who wants to read
about a teenager?


320
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,646
Well, the new generation did.


321
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,876
So, the greatest generation
is back from World War II.


322
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,106
It's 20 years later.


323
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,266
It's the rise of
the teenage culture.


324
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:54,096
They have disposable income.


325
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:56,116
They want to read about
heroes that are different.


326
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,056
They want to read about
heroes that are like them.


327
00:15:58,716 --> 00:15:59,786
They want to read about heroes


328
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:02,996
that are a little more
relatable, who are not perfect,


329
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:05,876
they're not square jawed
aliens from another world,


330
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:08,836
or rich billionaires, they
are skinny Peter Parker


331
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,636
from Queens who gets picked on.


332
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:14,466
But the publisher
didn't realize this,


333
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:17,336
didn't know who was
going to read this book.


334
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,096
And so he's yelling
at Stan and Steve,


335
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,576
what the hell are you doing?


336
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:24,926
As you can guess, at that moment
in comes someone from sales.


337
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:27,886
Boss, boss, look at
the sales numbers!


338
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,926
Keep doing it!


339
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,196
Another hit.


340
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:36,406
And you can see what made
him really different.


341
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:40,576
I mean check out poor Peter
over there in the bow tie,


342
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:43,946
and the glasses, and the kids
pointing at him, and laughing


343
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:48,166
at him, and as you can see, via
the art, without reading a word,


344
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,866
you see that he's ostracized.


345
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,326
He feels alone.


346
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:52,826
He is an underdog.


347
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,126
But look behind him.


348
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,406
Look at the shadow
of the hero within.


349
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:01,456
And don't we all feel
that way sometimes.


350
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,866
We feel the world is against us.


351
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:08,506
We feel the world is judging us,
but we know, we know within us,


352
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:12,236
if given the opportunity,
lies greatness.


353
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,056
So, as with Captain America,


354
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,965
Spider-Man was a
bit controversial


355
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:19,496
when he came out,
with some readers.


356
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,536
They didn't get it.


357
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,616
But many more did.


358
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:25,476
And that wasn't the only
controversial things


359
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:27,665
that we did with him.


360
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:33,886
Let's see, in 1970 the president
happened to be Richard Nixon,


361
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:38,036
believe it or not, went to Stan
Lee, and President Nixon said,


362
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:40,526
Stan we have this
problem with drugs.


363
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,266
And we're going to lose
a lot of young people.


364
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,466
And President Nixon knew
how popular the comics were,


365
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,586
that Marvel were publishing.


366
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,516
And he said, could
you do a comic book


367
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:53,526
that would mention
the drug problem?


368
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,636
Stan thought about it and he
said, you know what, I will.


369
00:17:56,636 --> 00:18:01,086
And what was remarkable
is he did it in the pages


370
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,256
of Amazing Spider-Man.


371
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,586
Now we had many characters
to choose from.


372
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,206
Stan could have selected one


373
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,036
of our less popular
characters, but he didn't.


374
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:10,416
He picked Spider-Man.


375
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,666
Now, you'll see there's
something that's not


376
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,036
on this cover.


377
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:19,166
Now see up there on the top
right of Amazing Fantasy 15.


378
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,986
That's the Comic's
Code Authority Stamp,


379
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,736
was a seal of approval
that basically told parents


380
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,836
that the comic was safe for
younger readers to read,


381
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:29,166
it didn't have, you
know certain levels


382
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,396
of violence, things like that.


383
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:34,426
What's not on this cover?


384
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:35,386
There's no Comic's Code.


385
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,516
See what happened was,
when we were ready


386
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,466
to publish it Stan
gave the comic


387
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:42,356
to the Comic's Code Authority
to read and to give their stamp


388
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,326
of approval and the Comic's Code
said, you can't publish this.


389
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:47,296
Stan said, why not?


390
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,496
He said because it
mentions drugs.


391
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:52,826
Stan said, but it's not
doing it in a positive way.


392
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,286
It's an antidrug story.


393
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,246
And they said, we don't care.


394
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:58,736
You -- the Comic's Code says
there can be no mention of drugs


395
00:18:58,966 --> 00:19:01,356
in the comic, so you
can't publish this


396
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,366
with the Comic's Code
Stamp of Approval.


397
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:06,766
And Stan said, good, we're
going to publish it anyway;


398
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:08,006
without the Comic's Code.


399
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:13,896
First time that happened,
and it was a hit.


400
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,066
People really responded to it.


401
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:21,036
They responded to, really kind
of a smart, difficult story.


402
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,906
In the story Peter's
roommate, Harry Osborn,


403
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:27,016
the son of the Green
Goblin, had a pill problem,


404
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:30,386
and Spider-Man had to council
him and finally get him help.


405
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,816
But they handled it in
a way that the readers


406
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:34,176
at the time could appreciate.


407
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:37,606
Stan was really speaking to
the readers in a language


408
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:38,526
that they wanted to hear.


409
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:42,016
But, as you can guess, it
was a little controversial,


410
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,996
but sometimes we've
got to take a stand.


411
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:47,296
Right? We have to use
art to send a message.


412
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,066
But it didn't stop
there, with that issue.


413
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:54,196
No. We use Spider-Man
from time to time


414
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:55,496
to speak to other things.


415
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:58,696
So, in this case it was
2011, and we had a line


416
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,926
of comics called The Ultimate
Line of Marvel Comics.


417
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,926
They were set on another
world where we kind


418
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,626
of started -- we started now.


419
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,006
Rather than having our
history starting in the 60s,


420
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,366
we kind of started
this new line,


421
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:10,646
but wanted to make it different.


422
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:12,356
We wanted to make it unexpected.


423
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:16,726
And so actually on that
world that Peter Parker died


424
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:20,926
in battle protecting Aunt
May from the Green Goblin.


425
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:25,466
And in that reality there was
a boy named Miles Morales,


426
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:30,126
who happened to also be
infected by a spider bite.


427
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,776
And when that world's Peter
Parker died Miles decided the


428
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,556
world still needs a Spider-Man.


429
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:37,886
So, he made his own
costume and he became


430
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:41,316
that world's Spider-Man.


431
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,586
And, as you can see, looks a
bit different from Peter, right?


432
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:47,346
He's half African American,
and he's half Puerto Rican.


433
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:52,926
And I remember the day I came
into work, I was an editor


434
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,536
at the time for Marvel
Publishing.


435
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,366
An editor is sort
of like a producer,


436
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,746
we're selecting the writers
and the artists to work


437
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,056
on the series, and we're working
with them through every step


438
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,626
of the way, deciding
what's printed on the cover


439
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,396
to what's in the word balloons.


440
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:07,266
We work on everything.


441
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,136
And we also have access


442
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,216
to an email account
called mheros@marvel.com,


443
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:15,126
and people can write in letters.


444
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,616
Usually they write in and say,


445
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,406
why can't Peter Parker
marry Jane,


446
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,306
be happily married ever after?


447
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:25,376
Why can't Rogue and
Gambit just be together?


448
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,926
Why are you so cruel to them?


449
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,656
Because drama, that's why.


450
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:32,636
So, that --


451
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:36,716
[ Applause ]


452
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:40,166
So, I remember I came
in and our offices


453
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,766
and that email account
were flooded with letters.


454
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,316
And some of them weren't happy.


455
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:49,356
One was from a dad, I'll never
forget it, he wrote and he said,


456
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:54,846
when my kids get home from
school I'm going to take them


457
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,006
to the backyard and
I'm going to stack


458
00:21:57,006 --> 00:21:59,256
up all their Spider-Man comics
and I'm going to burn them.


459
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:04,316
He said, why did you make -- why
did you turn Spider Man black?


460
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:05,836
Why did you do this?


461
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:10,126
Why with your East
Coast liberal views?


462
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:13,296
Why are you ruining our hero?


463
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:17,126
So, I wrote to him and I
said, Sir, you don't have


464
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:21,396
to buy a single additional
issue of this series,


465
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:24,176
but just so you know,


466
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:27,866
in the regular Marvel Universe
Peter Parker is alive and well.


467
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:31,776
But we're offering an
alternative with a Spider-Man


468
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,706
that looks a bit different.


469
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:35,986
So, I said, you don't have
to buy any new issues,


470
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:40,156
but please don't burn
your kids' comics.


471
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:44,816
It will not have the effect on
them that you think it will.


472
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,256
It will be far, far worse.


473
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:48,726
Now he didn't respond.


474
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:49,926
I don't know if he
burned them or not.


475
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:51,366
I'd like to hope he didn't.


476
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:54,176
Who can say?


477
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,576
But I can say, immediately
after reading


478
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:57,596
that I read a great letter.


479
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:01,126
A young woman wrote in
and said, thank you.


480
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:07,136
She says, now my little brother
has a Spider-Man that looks just


481
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,716
like him, and he feels great.


482
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:16,366
He feels he is represented
up here, on this cover.


483
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:17,946
And that's why we do it.


484
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:25,556
[ Applause ]


485
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:28,226
Alright, my next
friend -- let's see.


486
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,116
Oh, he really loved his dad.


487
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:35,236
His dad led this --
more than a business --


488
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,716
like an empire, you could say.


489
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:39,686
My friend really -- he
loved him, and he hoped


490
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,246
to one day take over for him.


491
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:46,116
And as fate would have
it, his dad was killed,


492
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:51,206
and my friend did have to step
in for him and run the empire.


493
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:54,136
And he found it was so much more
challenging than he ever knew,


494
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:57,356
and he realized it was
constantly under attack


495
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,606
by others outside of it.


496
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,956
And he had to find the
courage within himself to step


497
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:06,196
into the boots of his father,
but to become his own person.


498
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:10,156
I'm talking about
The Black Panther,


499
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,746
who many of you may
have been introduced


500
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:15,546
to in the latest Captain
America Civil War movie.


501
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,686
So, Black Panther was
introduced in the pages


502
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:21,126
of The Fantastic Four, 1966.


503
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:26,506
And it was remarkable because
it was the first black character


504
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,326
introduced by one of the
major comic book publishers.


505
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:34,386
And what's also crazy cool is
that he was no one's sidekick.


506
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:36,346
He was no one's servant.


507
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:40,136
When the Fantastic Four
answered his invitation to go


508
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:43,876
to his nation of Wakanda,
this was a country we made


509
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,676
up that was in Africa.


510
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:51,066
They saw that he was a king,
and he was a king of a nation


511
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:53,186
that was the world's
most technologically


512
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:54,706
advanced country.


513
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:58,766
And so again, I think the
creators, this time Stan Lee


514
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:00,466
and Jack Kirby, were
making a statement.


515
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:05,206
Were making a statement just in
the choices they were making.


516
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:09,596
And people loved Black
Panther right away.


517
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:13,956
And they were very smart in
the stories they told with him,


518
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:17,356
and I think they told some
very symbolic stories,


519
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:18,716
like this next cover.


520
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,946
So, here we are in
the 70s, and yeah,


521
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,886
Black Panther is
taking on the Klan.


522
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:29,306
He's actually ripping himself
off a cross before they set it


523
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:30,226
on fire.


524
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:36,286
What an emotional,
powerful, symbolic image.


525
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:39,856
One of the things I love about
him is that he's outnumbered.


526
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,176
I love that they chose, not
to just have one Klan member


527
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:44,966
at the bottom, but there's
a whole group of them.


528
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,966
This always -- this again
speaks to the Marvel message


529
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:50,766
of underdogs feeling
outnumbered,


530
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:54,616
feeling the world is against
you, but deciding to fight back,


531
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:57,766
deciding to do the
right thing anyway.


532
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:04,236
My next friend, she
was an orphan too.


533
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:06,186
I think I should stop
there and talk about;


534
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:10,626
what's up with all the orphans?


535
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:14,256
Well, in any sort of art form
you have to make decisions to --


536
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:16,936
especially in fiction --
you want to get the audience


537
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:20,086
on the side of your character,
and if you have limited time,


538
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:24,206
say a limited page count of a
comic book or a limited time


539
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,016
in a movie or in a video game,


540
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,776
you have to make
choices right away


541
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:30,636
that helps your audience
connect with your character.


542
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:33,386
So, that's why you -- it's a
tradition in heroic fiction,


543
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:38,006
all these orphans; Luke
Skywalker, Harry Potter,


544
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:43,486
every Disney princess,
poor Bambi.


545
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:48,696
There goes mama [laughter]
Why do we do this?


546
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:50,906
Why do we do this?


547
00:26:50,906 --> 00:26:52,746
Because again, we're
trying to get the audience


548
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:53,866
on the side of the hero.


549
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:57,226
And what's the one thing that
everyone can either fear,


550
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,466
or if it's unfortunate enough
to have gone through it,


551
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:03,126
to sympathize with,
losing the parents,


552
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,076
something everyone can fear.


553
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:07,226
So, it gets your audience
on the side of the hero.


554
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,996
It also literally forces the
character out of the nest.


555
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,256
Our characters must now
stand on their own two feet


556
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,236
and again make their choices
about power and responsibility.


557
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:19,946
So, that's why you often see
it in super heroes like this.


558
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:22,846
So, my next friend;
she was an orphan


559
00:27:23,106 --> 00:27:24,316
and she felt like a freak.


560
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:28,766
She was like this friend,
she was born in Africa,


561
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:32,606
and she had silver hair.


562
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,056
She was black but she had
silver hair and she felt


563
00:27:36,146 --> 00:27:40,486
like everyone was judging
her and condemning her


564
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:42,786
and thinking she was some
sort of witch or a monster.


565
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:48,486
And one day this really nice
teacher came up to her and said,


566
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,196
you're not cursed,
you're blessed.


567
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:55,636
I want you to come with me
to my school in Westchester


568
00:27:57,006 --> 00:28:00,446
where everyone looks really
cool and we have these cool jets


569
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,196
to fly around in, and together
we're going to go around


570
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:05,586
and we're going to show
the world that people


571
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:07,006
like you are not evil.


572
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,866
That people like you are good.


573
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:12,356
And we can all work together
to create a better world.


574
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:14,506
So, can you guess
my next friend?


575
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,516
Storm! Storm, a mutant.


576
00:28:17,516 --> 00:28:20,746
In the Marvel universe we
kind of divide the characters


577
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:21,836
by how they get their powers.


578
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:24,406
So, if you get bitten
by a radioactive spider,


579
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:27,106
or if it's cosmic rays,
or if it's gamma rays,


580
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:30,896
the creators were really
grappling with the Cold War


581
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,496
at the time, and the
fear of the bomb.


582
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:36,096
That's why there's all this
radiation in our characters.


583
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:39,326
But if you're a mutant you
are just born different,


584
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:41,196
it's in your genes
from the start,


585
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,606
and when you hit puberty, ta da!


586
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:48,036
You're body starts changing,
and in the case of the mutants,


587
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:50,886
you grow wings, lasers
shoot out of your eyes.


588
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:51,906
And isn't that what you felt


589
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:53,356
like when you were
going through puberty?


590
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:56,886
I did. And so the
teacher I was talking


591
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:58,386
about is Professor X, right?


592
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:00,556
And so he comes up to
the mutants and he says,


593
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:03,106
come with me and we're
going to change the world.


594
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,696
We're going to show the world
that mutants and humans can live


595
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,506
and work together
to change the world.


596
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,236
And it's a great message.


597
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:11,266
And another message
was sent by this cover.


598
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:14,336
I've mentioned America a
lot in this discussion.


599
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:17,866
And super humans are a
uniquely American invention.


600
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,526
We came up with them and I
think we do them really great,


601
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:24,736
and you could say right now
it's one of our greatest gifts


602
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:27,266
to the world is the super hero.


603
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,616
We export the super
hero around the world.


604
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:32,976
But this issue was different.


605
00:29:33,036 --> 00:29:36,596
This issue introduced
international characters.


606
00:29:37,496 --> 00:29:39,966
So, you have Storm
up there flying.


607
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:43,286
The big metal guy is
Colossus, he is Russian.


608
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,166
And to me, as a kid,
that was huge.


609
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:51,196
My mom was Ukrainian, and so I
remember growing up in the 80s,


610
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:52,796
you know anyone from
Eastern European,


611
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:53,896
and anywhere near Russia was,


612
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:56,156
you know those were
commies, they're evil.


613
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:59,806
But in the comics I saw that,
no, Russians can be good.


614
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,036
Colossus is a hero.


615
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:02,586
It meant a lot to me.


616
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:06,136
So, also you see Nightcrawler,
with the blue face, he's German.


617
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:09,126
Wolverine, with the
claws, from Canada.


618
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:11,566
True story.


619
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:14,066
International group.


620
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:18,326
Again, I think they were making
a choice deliberately to say,


621
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:20,406
again, it doesn't
matter who you are


622
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:23,876
or where you come from,
we can all be heroes.


623
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:24,816
We can all be heroes.


624
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,316
And storm was really unique


625
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,466
because she wasn't only
just really powerful,


626
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,936
she can control the weather,
she can make it thunder


627
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,056
and lightning and storm.


628
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:37,316
Not only that, but she had
real strength of character.


629
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:38,436
I mean look at this next cover.


630
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:41,046
That's her rocking
the Grace Jones look,


631
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:43,226
with the mohawk and the leather.


632
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,096
And she was saying to the
world, hey this is me.


633
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,486
Love me or hate me,
this is who I am.


634
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:49,476
Now, this issue was significant


635
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:52,836
because she actually challenged
Cyclops for leadership


636
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,506
of the X-Men, and she did it
at a time when she was zapped


637
00:30:57,176 --> 00:30:59,756
by a gun and she didn't
even have her mutant powers.


638
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:03,596
But she was very smart
and she was crafty,


639
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:05,806
and she beat Cyclops.


640
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:09,666
So, here I am, this white kid.


641
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:12,346
At the time I was living
down south in Tennessee,


642
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:16,866
and I read a comic book where a
black woman defeats a white man


643
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:21,466
for leadership of Marvel's most
popular and powerful super team.


644
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,546
And you know what I said, and
readers around the world said?


645
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:26,796
We said, alright!


646
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:29,336
Cool! She's earned it.


647
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:32,466
So, I think stories like this,


648
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,616
and images like this,
they have an impact.


649
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,736
And Storm isn't the only
powerful female that we have.


650
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:41,076
We actually have a
tradition of strong women.


651
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:44,246
In the movies you've seen Black
Widow and Scarlett, which,


652
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:45,316
we announced we're finally going


653
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:47,626
to do a female solo
movie, Captain Marvel.


654
00:31:47,996 --> 00:31:51,506
We have a history of
these strong women and we


655
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:53,686
like to celebrate them.


656
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:56,346
So, this year we did an
event called Women of Power.


657
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:59,126
We were going to -- it
was kind of a salute


658
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,326
to International
Women's History Day.


659
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,226
And so we said, let's do a
whole month to celebrate.


660
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,636
So, up top you see these images.


661
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:07,796
We created these covers.


662
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,576
We created 24 different
variant covers that were going


663
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:11,656
to go on our comic books.


664
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,506
And I knew we were doing
this months in advance.


665
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:16,596
So, I called up my
friends in publishing,


666
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:19,586
because at this point I'm now --
was over in California working


667
00:32:19,586 --> 00:32:21,716
for the Marvel Games team
as Creative Director --


668
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:23,806
and I said, hey, let's team up.


669
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:26,856
I want to do women of
power in our games.


670
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,136
And they said, well how
are you going to do that?


671
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,376
I said, I'm going to call all
of our different partners,


672
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:35,126
who create all of our mobile
games, and I'm going to ask them


673
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:36,396
if they want to participate.


674
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:39,116
I'm going to say, hey do you
have any female characters


675
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:40,746
that you were going to
introduce in the games?


676
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:44,726
Do you want to hold
them until that month?


677
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,566
And everyone whose logo
you see up there said, yes!


678
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,426
And so we did the Women
of Power event in games.


679
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:52,716
It was covered by
Entertainment Weekly,


680
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:54,116
and then Forbes picked it up.


681
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:57,756
And it was a way for
us to make a statement


682
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,296
without even saying anything.


683
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,646
See, at the time,
you know the story


684
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,116
of Gamer Gate was in the news.


685
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,066
And people were asking me, what
do you think of Gamer Gate?


686
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,906
And I said, what do I think?


687
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,226
I -- we love our female readers.


688
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,286
We love our female characters.


689
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:16,536
We love our -- most of
our staff is female.


690
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:20,776
We want to invite
everybody to the party.


691
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,886
And that's what the Women
of Power event represented.


692
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,226
And that's what it
said with us having


693
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:28,486
to make a statement on it.


694
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:29,976
My last-- Yes!


695
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:36,096
[ Applause ]


696
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:37,736
Let's see, my next friend --


697
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:39,746
I lied a bit, it's
actually a group.


698
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:40,676
It's a group of friends,


699
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:44,176
but they're so united
I think of them as one.


700
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:48,546
These friends, like my
other friends, were orphaned


701
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:50,816
in some way, and
they felt alone,


702
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:52,266
and they felt like misfits.


703
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:54,866
But they ran into each
other and they looked around


704
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,916
and they said, you know what?


705
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,066
You're my kind of misfit.


706
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,986
And they formed a
new family together,


707
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:02,806
and they were all very
different, but they said,


708
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,866
you know despite our differences
we can stand together


709
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,236
and we can save,
not only the world,


710
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:09,755
we can save the entire galaxy.


711
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:13,386
My next friends, The
Guardians of the Galaxy.


712
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:15,775
Now this -- Yeah!


713
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:20,096
Yes, that's a talking
raccoon and a walking tree,


714
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:21,306
that does deserve applause!


715
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:28,536
So, this cover that came out in
2008, I was actually the editor


716
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:29,936
of the series at the time.


717
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:32,416
I was asked to edit
our Cosmic Books,


718
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:34,235
and I wanted to do a team book.


719
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:37,255
I had a book that was a
solo hero called Nova.


720
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:40,886
And I said, well now I want to
do a team, but I want it to be,


721
00:34:40,886 --> 00:34:44,376
you know the freaks and geeks
of the Marvel Cosmic Heroes.


722
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,735
I want it to be a
true Marvel creation.


723
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:49,906
And then I got this name,
Guardians of the Galaxy.


724
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,176
There was a team in
the 70s with that name.


725
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,585
And we hadn't used that
name in a long time.


726
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:56,626
And I'm like, I want to use
-- this name is perfect.


727
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,216
You hear it and you know
instantly what they do;


728
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:00,856
they guard the galaxy.


729
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:04,836
So, one night I have
my official handbooks


730
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,456
of the Marvel Universe, they're
these encyclopedias, right?


731
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:09,066
And they -- with
these bio-entries.


732
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,766
And I have them open, and
I have them putting --


733
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:14,536
and I'm going through and I'm
finding all these characters


734
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:16,966
that I remember from
when I was little and --


735
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,316
but we haven't seen
them in a while.


736
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:21,096
So, I'm putting sticky
notes on all these pages,


737
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:23,356
and I have them spread
out on the floor.


738
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:26,986
And my wife comes in and she
says, Billy, what are you doing?


739
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:28,086
You're making a mess!


740
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,746
I said, honey, I'm building
Marvel's next great team,


741
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:33,606
and this is going
to be our star.


742
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:37,566
And I show her a page and
she says, is that a squirrel?


743
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:39,196
And I said, it's a raccoon!


744
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,706
Back in the 80s there was
a mini-series called Rocket


745
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,696
Raccoon that I thought
was just awesome.


746
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:48,506
I mean it was a raccoon with
a big gun and a jet pack


747
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:50,596
and a bad attitude, and
who doesn't love that?


748
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:53,806
And I thought if we just
give them the right platform,


749
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:55,266
then the world will love him.


750
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,496
And I just continued
on that role


751
00:35:57,496 --> 00:35:59,556
and I found all these
crazy characters.


752
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:05,356
Groot, a walking tree and Drax,
this weird, big, muscular,


753
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:08,816
but not too smart assassin, and
Gamora, the most deadliest woman


754
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:12,266
in the galaxy, and that's
Star-Lord there holding the gun.


755
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:16,676
And it didn't have a huge
following, but the people


756
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,386
that read the comic
really loved it.


757
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,756
And I remember one
day my phone rings.


758
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:25,066
Hello. It's a friend over on the
West Coast and he's like, Bill,


759
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:27,376
the crew here in Marvel Studios,


760
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:30,056
we really like your
Cosmic Books,


761
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,556
especially Guardians
of the Galaxy.


762
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,446
I'm like, that's cool.


763
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:35,176
Cool bud, I'm glad you like it.


764
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:37,906
No, no, we really like it!


765
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,906
So, what does that mean?


766
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,056
Can't tell you, bye.


767
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,166
Click. Well, what do
I see months later?


768
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,286
The movie poster.


769
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:52,786
And I said, that's
our Guardians!


770
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:56,366
They made it about our team!


771
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:58,756
And it was remarked
about the film --


772
00:36:58,756 --> 00:37:02,246
and of course it was great,
the script was fantastic,


773
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:05,246
and the director, James Gunn,
and the cast, just beautiful,


774
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:08,686
it was awesome and --
but what was unique


775
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,706
about it was the
content was rather new


776
00:37:11,706 --> 00:37:12,806
for a Marvel Studios movie.


777
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:16,036
Usually we look back, if
you think about Iron Man


778
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:19,316
and Captain America, we look
back at the original comics back


779
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:21,996
in the 60s and even
in Cap's case the 40s,


780
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:23,836
and we base the stories on that.


781
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:25,406
But they were basing
this content


782
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:26,686
from just a few years ago.


783
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:30,136
And it was characters that
no one knew about really.


784
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:31,426
When you see the
movie you walk in


785
00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:34,766
and assume these are new created
characters, but they're not.


786
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:35,706
They're decades old.


787
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:37,336
They're from the 80s and the 70s


788
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:39,016
and even the 60s
these characters.


789
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:40,046
And they're crazy.


790
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:40,916
They're freaky, right?


791
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,816
They're -- it's like
a raccoon and a tree.


792
00:37:42,816 --> 00:37:44,706
And people are like,
is this going to be --


793
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:45,906
I remember the headlines;
this is going


794
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:47,516
to be Marvel's first flop!


795
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,606
I said, no it's not!


796
00:37:48,606 --> 00:37:49,686
It's going to be great!


797
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:51,746
And the reason it was a hit,


798
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:55,206
even though the characters
were crazy, and it took place


799
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,836
in space, they grounded
it in family.


800
00:37:57,836 --> 00:38:01,576
It was all about family
from the very first scene


801
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:04,086
when Peter Quill is
kidnapped from his parents,


802
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:07,806
all through the movie, when you
meet all the characters they


803
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:09,736
talk about how they feel
like they're the only one


804
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:12,706
of their kind, or in Drax
case he lost his family.


805
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,916
They were all alone, but they
looked at each other and said,


806
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:18,126
we will be each other's
new family.


807
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:21,816
Groot goes from I am
Groot, to we are Groot.


808
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:23,906
That was the message.


809
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:27,656
And I think everyone, in one way
or another, can relate to that.


810
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:31,016
As we grow up we often
move away from home.


811
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,496
We leave our family.


812
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:33,846
We go to school.


813
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:35,006
We get jobs.


814
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:36,116
What do we do?


815
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:37,076
We look around.


816
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:39,116
We find other misfits
like ourselves,


817
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,916
and we form new families.


818
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:43,826
I think that's what is at
the message of it and it was


819
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:46,796
in every scene and that's why
it was the hit that it was.


820
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:50,956
Alright, I have one more
friend to talk about.


821
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:57,156
And he is not on this cover, but
it all begins with this cover.


822
00:38:57,156 --> 00:39:00,176
Let's see, so there I was,


823
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:03,466
at work when I was
still on the East Coast.


824
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:06,446
And it was a February
and it was cold and rainy


825
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:09,526
and I had walked 20 minutes from
Grand Central and I was soaked.


826
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:13,706
And my phone's ringing and I
know I have to go to a meeting


827
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:16,016
in 20 minutes and I
turn on my computer


828
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:17,176
and I look at my emails.


829
00:39:17,176 --> 00:39:19,066
And there's a wall,
a wall of emails.


830
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:22,316
And some of them were, like
I mentioned, that email,


831
00:39:22,386 --> 00:39:24,646
mheroes@marvel.com,
letters were coming in.


832
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:26,216
And some of them were again,


833
00:39:26,216 --> 00:39:28,646
saying how they loved some
issues and hated some issues.


834
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,336
And one subject line
just said, help.


835
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:35,476
That got my attention
so I opened the email.


836
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,776
And it was not a letter
complaining about Rogue


837
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,576
and Gambit or Peter
Parker and Mary Jane.


838
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:42,416
No, it was from a
mom named Christina.


839
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:45,906
She said, I need your help.


840
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:50,616
Said, my little boy Anthony,
who's four years old,


841
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:54,166
this morning he did not want
to wear his hearing aid.


842
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:57,066
We call it blue ear because
it's made of blue plastic.


843
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,686
He said, mama, I'm
not wearing blue ear.


844
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:01,456
And I said, why not?


845
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:05,266
And he said, because super
heroes don't wear blue ears.


846
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:10,676
So, Anthony at that age,
four, knew he was different.


847
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:14,926
So, Christina tells me
that she says, yes they do.


848
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,476
Super heroes where hearing aids.


849
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:19,826
And he said, you mean
like Marvel Characters?


850
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:21,576
And she said, yes of course.


851
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:23,926
And he said, well
mama, which ones?


852
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:26,586
She said, I'll tell you when
you get back from school.


853
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:30,196
She drives Anthony to school.


854
00:40:30,476 --> 00:40:32,346
Runs back.


855
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,636
Help! Oh, what am I
going to tell him?


856
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:37,066
I don't know if any super
heroes wear hearing aids,


857
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:38,986
and he can't know
his mom was lying!


858
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,306
But I have faith, I think
there are some, right?


859
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,436
I'm not a liar right?


860
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:46,686
So, there I am, and the
phone's ringing, like I said.


861
00:40:46,686 --> 00:40:47,946
And I go to the meeting.


862
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:53,116
And my finger is going to the
delete button, and I stopped


863
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:56,096
and I said, what
would Peter Parker do?


864
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,176
Catholic guilt!


865
00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:02,206
What would he do?


866
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:04,806
But that is seriously
something I would ask myself


867
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:05,556
when I was growing up.


868
00:41:05,556 --> 00:41:06,846
I didn't really want
to be Spider-Man,


869
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:07,926
I wanted to be Peter Parker.


870
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,246
Because even though he wasn't
perfect, he always tried


871
00:41:11,246 --> 00:41:12,896
to do the right thing.


872
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:15,686
So, I said, okay, power
and responsibility.


873
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:16,586
What can I do?


874
00:41:16,716 --> 00:41:17,886
Well, I don't have
a lot of power,


875
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:20,126
but I have information
on super heroes.


876
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:21,856
And I have access to images.


877
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:22,306
I have that.


878
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:23,846
So, what's my responsibility?


879
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:25,156
I've got to use that
to help her.


880
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:28,086
So, instead of deleting the
email I sent it throughout


881
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,306
Marvel Editorial.


882
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:30,216
I said, what can we do?


883
00:41:31,016 --> 00:41:34,216
Do we -- do you remember any
heroes that have hearing aids?


884
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:35,906
Or could we even maybe
ask one of our artists


885
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,986
to draw someone with
a hearing aid?


886
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:41,056
And my good friend Tom
Brevoort, who was my boss,


887
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:42,766
he reminded me of Hawkeye.


888
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:44,636
He said, oh, remember Hawkeye?


889
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:45,496
I said, you're right.


890
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:48,436
Back in the 80s he was on a
mission where he was trapped


891
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:52,236
by rubble and he used a sonic
arrow to get out of the rubble


892
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,116
and it burst his
eardrums and he was deaf.


893
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:57,326
And his good friend Tony
Stark, being the cool inventor


894
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,126
that he is, made
him hearing aids.


895
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:02,026
And to this day he's
our deaf hero.


896
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:04,486
And we've done stories
about him either wanting


897
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:05,676
to wear his hearing aid or not.


898
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:09,446
We've done whole issues in
sign language to use him,


899
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:12,356
and to use him as a metaphor,
again to say that everyone can


900
00:42:12,356 --> 00:42:15,756
and should be a hero, no matter
what your challenges may be.


901
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,796
So, I went through
our digital backlog


902
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,796
and I grabbed this
cover, because it was one


903
00:42:20,796 --> 00:42:22,116
of my favorites when
I was growing up.


904
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,496
And I sent it to Christina
and I said, Christina,


905
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:27,846
I want you to show this
cover to Anthony and tell him


906
00:42:28,156 --> 00:42:30,996
that not only do super heroes
wear hearing aids, but a member


907
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:34,296
of the world famous
Avengers wears a hearing aid.


908
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:37,456
And if Anthony wears his
hearing aid we will make him an


909
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:38,506
honorary Avenger.


910
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:47,716
And I thought, [applause] -- And
I thought, okay, good deed done


911
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:50,196
for the day, off
to my meeting I go.


912
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:58,126
The next Monday I get in my
in-box, this piece of art.


913
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,206
So, my friend Manny
Mederos, he saw my email,


914
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,636
he knew I was sharing
the picture of Hawkeye.


915
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:05,816
He draws this, on his
own time, for free.


916
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:06,896
He draws this over the weekend.


917
00:43:07,406 --> 00:43:09,506
He knew I sent the Hawkeye
cover, so he draws Hawkeye.


918
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:12,586
And then he invents Blue Ear


919
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,856
because that's what they
called the hearing aid.


920
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,756
And I send that to Christina.


921
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:21,066
And we -- I said, hey
man, that was awesome.


922
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:22,806
And we said, yeah, okay, cool.


923
00:43:23,456 --> 00:43:24,876
Good deed done for the day.


924
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:25,836
We're done right?


925
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:29,986
No. Next day I get
this piece of art


926
00:43:29,986 --> 00:43:32,956
by Nelson Ribeiro,
Adult Blue Ear!


927
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:35,726
With his mighty hearing
aid he's hearing trouble


928
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:36,526
and he will go help!


929
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:43,166
I send this to Christina and
we think, okay, we did it!


930
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:43,706
It's awesome!


931
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:51,236
Three weeks later she
writes me back and she says,


932
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:55,136
Bill you don't know
what an impact this had


933
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,386
on Anthony's life.


934
00:43:57,806 --> 00:44:00,256
I've had to print out these
images multiple times now


935
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:02,586
because he keeps
bringing them to school


936
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,226
and gets them all muddy.


937
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:07,116
And now I had to put
them in plastic sleeves.


938
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:10,186
And he brings them to school,
and he goes to a school or kids


939
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:14,196
with hearing challenges, and
his other classmates see them


940
00:44:14,796 --> 00:44:20,116
and get so excited, and
they feel acknowledged


941
00:44:20,946 --> 00:44:23,706
and represented, and they
see themselves up there.


942
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:24,936
And the teacher saw --


943
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:35,546
[ Applause ]


944
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:38,046
The teacher saw how
excited the kids were,


945
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:41,826
and the teachers
organized Super Hero Week,


946
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:46,196
where all the kids
could dress up.


947
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:48,376
And as fate would have it,


948
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:51,986
Anthony's grandfather
is a State Senator.


949
00:44:54,856 --> 00:44:55,686
Plot twist!


950
00:44:57,606 --> 00:45:00,256
So, one day the Senator is at
work and a reporter comes up


951
00:45:00,256 --> 00:45:02,746
and says, hey, do you
have any good, juicy,


952
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,496
negative political
gossip for us?


953
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:05,766
And he says, no, I
have a good story.


954
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:09,086
These people at this company
took time out of their day


955
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,896
to draw these pieces of art
and send it to my grandson.


956
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:14,606
And it was covered
by the local news.


957
00:45:14,606 --> 00:45:17,766
And it started getting
picked up by more news sites.


958
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:20,076
And then I have the New York
Daily News on the phone wanting


959
00:45:20,076 --> 00:45:21,836
to ask me about this,
and the New York Post.


960
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:25,176
And from that day forward
I kept receiving emails


961
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:27,206
from families saying,
I heard about Blue Ear.


962
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:28,496
Can you send me the comic book?


963
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:33,176
And I had to keep saying,
there is no comic book!


964
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:34,776
There's just these
pieces of art.


965
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:36,196
But I kept getting these emails.


966
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:37,006
Kept getting them.


967
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:39,986
And I bugged the hell
out of my bosses.


968
00:45:39,986 --> 00:45:41,586
And I kept saying, we
need to do a comic.


969
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:42,926
We got to do a comic.


970
00:45:42,926 --> 00:45:44,026
There's a need for this.


971
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:45,336
Families need this information.


972
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:47,386
Kids need to see
themselves like this.


973
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:49,766
So, I kept bugging them.


974
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:50,486
I kept bugging them.


975
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:51,526
And at the time I was working


976
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:53,966
with a division called Custom
Publishing, where we would work


977
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:56,736
with clients outside of
Marvel, whether it was Visa


978
00:45:56,736 --> 00:45:59,376
or Cirque du Soleil, or
Harley-Davidson, you name it.


979
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:00,946
We would create things
like those --


980
00:46:00,996 --> 00:46:03,346
does anyone remember those
old Hostess fruit pie ads


981
00:46:03,346 --> 00:46:04,456
with our characters?


982
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:07,086
Yeah! That was good stuff!


983
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:08,576
That's the kind of
stuff we made.


984
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:12,146
We would make comics
posters, advertisements,


985
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,586
using our characters in an
authentically Marvel way,


986
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:16,306
to also promote another brand.


987
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:20,196
So, finally we partnered with
the Children's Hearing Institute


988
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,526
and we made a comic book!


989
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,686
But we decided, hey let's use
Iron Man front and center.


990
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:28,426
Why? We want to get
everyone's attention.


991
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,236
He's one of our most
famous characters now.


992
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,906
But not only is he
famous, he's a metaphor.


993
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:35,776
We used him as a metaphor.


994
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:39,456
We said to the kids, hey, if
you have to wear a hearing aid


995
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:41,936
like Blue Ear or if you have
to wear a cochlear implant,


996
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:44,756
that's Saphira on the
other side, in the pink,


997
00:46:45,256 --> 00:46:47,126
because this is in the
tradition of Women of Power,


998
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:48,866
we wanted to have
a female character


999
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:50,756
for young women to see.


1000
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:52,766
So, we said, hey, if you
have to wear a hearing aid


1001
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:54,816
or cochlear implant,
you're just like Tony Stark.


1002
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:57,926
He uses his tech to
be the best he can be.


1003
00:46:57,926 --> 00:47:00,706
You can use your tech to
be the best you can be.


1004
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,876
And the comic came out, and the
day it came out I got emails


1005
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:07,516
from Italy and Australia
saying, thank you and asking


1006
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:09,496
for copies of the comic book.


1007
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:13,366
And that created
another wave of press.


1008
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:14,836
Yes, it did not stop.


1009
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:20,556
And one day I get a call and
I was asked to go on CNN.


1010
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,586
I'm like, alright.


1011
00:47:24,256 --> 00:47:29,566
So, I'm in the limo
going into Manhattan.


1012
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:32,256
Mom. Yes Billy?


1013
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:35,786
Mom, in half hour I
want you to turn on CNN.


1014
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,096
I'm going to be on.


1015
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:39,306
Billy, what did you do?


1016
00:47:40,646 --> 00:47:41,376
No, mom it's good!


1017
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:41,856
It's Blue Ear.


1018
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:42,336
It's Blue Ear.


1019
00:47:42,336 --> 00:47:43,936
He's going to be on the show.


1020
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:45,956
And actually, Christina and
Anthony are going to be there


1021
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:47,206
and we're going to meet up.


1022
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:49,646
And they're all going
to be able to meet.


1023
00:47:49,706 --> 00:47:50,586
And then guess what.


1024
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,966
Then we're going into the
Marvel office together.


1025
00:47:53,516 --> 00:48:04,626
[ Applause ]


1026
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:07,076
So, there's Nelson, who
created the cover piece.


1027
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:09,196
There's me, grinning
like an idiot.


1028
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:11,716
And there's Anthony,
and you'll notice he's


1029
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:13,046
in the whole Blue Ear costume,


1030
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:16,466
because mom saw how
excited Anthony was.


1031
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:18,276
And he felt like, I'm
going to be Blue Ear.


1032
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:19,956
And so he dresses up like this


1033
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:21,736
and now the town
knows him as Blue Ear.


1034
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:23,876
And guess who was
the Grand Marshall


1035
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:28,106
of his town's Halloween parade
last year; Anthony as Blue Ear.


1036
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:33,866
So, these Marvel characters;
why do we make them?


1037
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:36,086
Power and responsibility.


1038
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:38,166
What can we learn from them?


1039
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:41,256
We have to use our
powers responsibly.


1040
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:44,246
Now, you may be thinking,
Bill I can't climb a wall.


1041
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:45,906
I can't leap through the sky.


1042
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:47,916
I don't have rays
coming out of my eyes.


1043
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:52,916
No, but everyone in this
room is incredibly smart


1044
00:48:53,446 --> 00:48:55,536
and incredibly gifted
with the skills you need


1045
00:48:55,886 --> 00:48:57,556
to create good things.


1046
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:01,786
We have to use and realize
what our powers are.


1047
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:06,556
We need to use them to create
things, to reach out to people


1048
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:10,006
like Anthony, and kids around
the world of all ages like that.


1049
00:49:10,336 --> 00:49:14,056
We must use our creations to
make the world a better place.


1050
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:14,936
Thank you very much.
