00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:23,766
>> Hello. My name is Ellis
Verosub, and I'm responsible


3
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,726
for public transit
in Apple Maps.


4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,086
Our goal here at Apple is always


5
00:00:28,086 --> 00:00:30,596
to create the best possible
customer experience.


6
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:32,996
We believe that design
is not just


7
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:35,396
about how something
looks but how it works.


8
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,776
Great experiences are
intuitive and seamless.


9
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:42,486
In this talk, I'd like to
explore how these ideas apply


10
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:44,086
to transit in Apple Maps.


11
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:45,836
But first, I'd like to start


12
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:50,886
by giving you an
overview of our product.


13
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:55,156
Transit launched in September
2015 as part of iOS 9


14
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,016
and Mac OS X, El Capitan.


15
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:02,126
As of today, it is available
in 21 cities around the world


16
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,385
as well as over 300
cities in China.


17
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:09,756
We use transit schedule data
from over 250 transit agencies.


18
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,286
Here's a bit of a fun fact.


19
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:16,576
To date, we've mapped more
than 16,000 station entrances.


20
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:19,556
Next, I'd like to
give you an overview


21
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:21,856
of the four key features
of our product.


22
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:26,586
The first is a beautiful
transit map.


23
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,926
Roads and other driving-related
elements have been dimmed


24
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:32,316
out while transit
lines and key terminus


25
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,276
and transfer stations
are emphasized.


26
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,656
The second feature
is a departure board


27
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:43,976
for each station showing each
line that services the station.


28
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,696
The third is detailed point
to point directions along


29
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,726
with a guided navigation
experience.


30
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:01,236
Finally, we show
realtime advisories


31
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:04,646
and even modify our recommended
directions in response


32
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:07,556
to planned service changes
or unplanned incidents.


33
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,886
Our goal is to provide
a great experience


34
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,566
in each city we support.


35
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:17,676
So how do we do that?


36
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:21,436
We start with agency schedule
data, but we don't stop there.


37
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,246
We collect additional data


38
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:25,566
through original research
and field surveys.


39
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,486
Then we add in a layer
of curation to surprise


40
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:29,916
and delight our customers.


41
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,556
Our goal is that at every
moment customers should be able


42
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:36,466
to match the instruction we're
giving them to what they see


43
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,636
in the real world around them.


44
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,416
Gathering these details
takes a long time.


45
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,766
But as Steve Jobs once
said, "Details matter.


46
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,896
It's worth waiting
to get it right".


47
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:52,136
Here are some examples
of additional data


48
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,616
that we collect ourselves.


49
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,976
Station entrances and exits.


50
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:02,936
Station footprints or
the outlines of stations.


51
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,036
Agency signage.


52
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:11,436
And the real world
path of transit lines


53
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,316
by which I mean the path
that trains and buses


54
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:20,806
and ferries actually
take in the real world.


55
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:23,696
This example shows a
station entrance in London.


56
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:26,976
We've individually surveys
every entrance not just


57
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,746
for location but also type.


58
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,996
Stairs, escalator,
elevator, and so forth.


59
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:38,556
Here is that same entrance
represented on our transit map.


60
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,106
You can also see the
station outline here.


61
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:44,946
This is really helpful in
terms of finding your way into


62
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,216
and out of train stations.


63
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,486
Stations have different names
for exits and entrances.


64
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:55,506
From the outside, the entrance
might not even have a name.


65
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:58,996
But from the inside, there's
often a number or code.


66
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:03,476
We show that number
or code on our map


67
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,346
so that you can be
confident you are going


68
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,316
in the correct direction.


69
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:14,796
We try to match agency signage
as closely as possible not just


70
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,255
in terms of the signage itself,
but also what gets displayed


71
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:19,555
where and in what order.


72
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:25,446
Again, you see that
reflected on our map.


73
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:32,486
Finally, something that
is very important to us is


74
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:33,766
that the transit lines shown


75
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,886
on the map follow
their actual paths.


76
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:40,006
Many iconic transit maps such as
the London underground map are


77
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,526
schematic, not representative of
the actual path the lines take.


78
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:47,506
However, with a digital map on
a mobile device, it's important


79
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:50,966
that your location position as
reflected on the map matches


80
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,696
up with the line you're
actually traveling on.


81
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,586
This builds confidence


82
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:57,286
in the directions the
customer has been given.


83
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,536
After we've gathered all
of this additional data,


84
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,796
we go even deeper
into the experience.


85
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:09,696
Our belief is that every city
has a unique transit culture,


86
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,326
and we try to understand


87
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,726
and respect this culture
reflecting it back


88
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:14,756
at our customers.


89
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,766
In the next few slides,


90
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:19,026
I'm going to dive
into a few examples.


91
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:25,286
Boarding instructions vary
from system to system.


92
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:29,656
For example, in London
you board lines.


93
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,906
Whereas in New York
you board trains.


94
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:36,016
You don't take the
Victoria train in London


95
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:37,686
or the A Line in New York.


96
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,236
That's not a local convention.


97
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,086
Sometimes the line name matters,


98
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,366
but sometimes only the
system name matters.


99
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,696
Here in the Bay Area, for
example, you just take BART.


100
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:52,226
Sometimes the local convention
includes the type of vehicle,


101
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:53,546
sometimes it's assumed.


102
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:57,016
In Mexico City, we specify
that it's the Metro.


103
00:05:58,216 --> 00:05:59,716
We capture these subtleties


104
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,226
because that allows
our customers


105
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:04,686
to match what we're telling them
to the real world around them.


106
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,556
Here is a different example.


107
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:12,196
In New York, the MTA
doesn't list their lines


108
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,306
in alphabetical order.


109
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,236
Instead, they list
them by color.


110
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:18,476
A and C are blue,
B and D are orange.


111
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,446
You see the same ordering
reflected in our product.


112
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:32,106
Trams and street cars are
really the same type of vehicle,


113
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,286
but different cities
specifically refer


114
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:35,596
to one or the other.


115
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:38,686
For example, in Toronto,
you could tell a customer


116
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:42,226
to board the 510 Spadina Tram,
but that's not really correct.


117
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:45,136
Everyone calls it the
510 Spadina streetcar,


118
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:48,756
so that's what we
call it as well.


119
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:55,296
In Berlin, on the other
hand, you ride trams.


120
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,166
And that is reflected
in our experience.


121
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:06,056
Here's another example.


122
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:09,286
In San Francisco, you
ride inbound and outbound.


123
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,906
Whereas in London or Toronto,
you go northbound, southbound,


124
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:13,916
eastbound, and westbound.


125
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:20,346
But in New York, you
go uptown and downtown.


126
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:22,866
Again, you see this
reflected in our app.


127
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:27,046
One final example.


128
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,486
In Rio, the bus rapid transit
systems are very important.


129
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:33,296
In many ways, they are
the equals of the Metro


130
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,546
and commuter rail systems.


131
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:37,716
We raise the prominence of
these bus rapid transit lines


132
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:40,076
on our map to reflect
their importance.


133
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,466
That's the blue and orange lines


134
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,176
that you see in this
screen shot.


135
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,556
Here is how we build
up our feature.


136
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:55,266
We start with agency data for
schedules, but then we survey


137
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,096
to add additional curated data.


138
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,626
For example, station
entrances and line geometry


139
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,766
as we've previously seen.


140
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:03,366
Then we customize the experience


141
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,806
to respect the unique
culture of each city.


142
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,576
Finally, this is all
wrapped in our user interface


143
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,696
to bring delight
to our customers.


144
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,976
Now, I'd like to give
you a short demo.


145
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:28,136
Let's say you just flew into San
Francisco International Airport,


146
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:31,486
and you'd like directions
to Moscone West for WWDC.


147
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,936
First, you can see our
multiagency transit map.


148
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:38,336
As I mentioned, transit lines
are highlighted while roads


149
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:38,885
are dimmed.


150
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:43,166
Now, we're going to
look at the departures


151
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,376
for Powell Street Station.


152
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:48,056
Powell Street is serviced
by both BART and Muni,


153
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,416
and you can see the upcoming
BART departures as well


154
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,896
as the upcoming Muni departures.


155
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:02,446
Now, at the top I noticed
there was an advisory.


156
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,556
When I tap on details,


157
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:07,366
I see that Muni has some
service changed in effect,


158
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,476
and we are communicating
those service changes


159
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:10,386
to our customers.


160
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:20,596
You can zoom out to see
the entire transit network


161
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:20,976
of the Bay Area.


162
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:32,036
Or you can zoom in
to get more details.


163
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,896
The information density
and the lines


164
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:40,046
that we show changes
at each zoom.


165
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:43,756
Now, some people may want
to have different choices.


166
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,156
So, for example,
they may want to see


167
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:47,556
if a bus route is available.


168
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:52,636
In our product, you can select
the exact vehicles that you'd


169
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:53,806
like to use for your journey.


170
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,856
Here is a competing bus route.


171
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,986
Now, we didn't recommend
this because it takes longer.


172
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:03,986
But it's an option
that's available to you.


173
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:08,536
So let's go back to our
BART route and examine


174
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:09,716
that in greater detail.


175
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:16,726
The route planner tells you when
to leave, how long it will take,


176
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:17,946
and gives a summary
of the route.


177
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,636
Tapping on this, I get
what we call the list view.


178
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:23,266
A detailed list of
instructions to follow.


179
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,736
I can expand the list
of stops if I'd like.


180
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,106
Now, when I select start,
I enter guided navigation


181
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,416
with detailed instructions.


182
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,056
Since I'm already
at the airport,


183
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,656
it just tells me
to board the train.


184
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,346
Tells me to exit at Powell, and
shows me the previous station.


185
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:44,896
Here you can see we're
recommending a very specific


186
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:49,946
exit with an exit code, E3,
that's best for Moscone West.


187
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,616
Finally, I arrive
at my destination.


188
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:01,086
That concludes the presentation.


189
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,256
