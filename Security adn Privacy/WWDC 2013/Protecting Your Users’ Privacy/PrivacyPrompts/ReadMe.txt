PrivacyPrompts
--------------

PrivacyPrompts shows how to check and request access to data classes such as Location, Contacts, and social media in Privacy Settings on iOS.

The application has two view controllers:

* APLPrivacyClassesTableViewController is a tableview controller that displays all the privacy data classes in the system.
* APLPrivacyDetailViewController is a view controller that handles checking and requesting access to the users private data classes.



Note: If you request access to Location, the application will hang. This is a known issue that will be addressed.
