00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:11,626
>> Hello.


2
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:17,576
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:18,076 --> 00:00:19,406
Thank you very much
for coming today,


4
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:20,426
and if you're watching later


5
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:21,826
on video thanks so
much for watching.


6
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:25,206
I'm Ken Kocienda, and
this session is called


7
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:27,296
"A Strategy for Great Work."


8
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:31,746
So I think we all
try to do great work.


9
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,556
I certainly always
try to do great work.


10
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,886
Regardless of the
results and the outcome,


11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:40,516
certainly the effort is directed
towards doing something great.


12
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:42,236
I think that's probably
the same for all of you,


13
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:44,006
that's why you're here
at the conference today,


14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,196
that's maybe why you're
watching later on video.


15
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:50,216
Now this is a subject,
that's very important to me,


16
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,586
I like talking about it,
I like thinking about it.


17
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:56,646
And I was last on stage
in 2012 with a talk called


18
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:59,246
"Basics + Habits,"
where I talked


19
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,106
about some technical concerns,


20
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:03,166
some real certain nuts-and-bolts
things about how to set


21
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,176
up a project and then how


22
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:06,996
to run projects once
you have them going.


23
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:10,256
But, again, this is very
tactical, sort of down


24
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:14,216
into the details, things
like code review and working


25
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:17,656
with your other people that
you might have on a team.


26
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:20,636
So today it's different.


27
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:22,726
I would like to in
this session talk


28
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:26,716
about some higher level ideas,
kind of move it up to the level


29
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:29,156
of strategy rather than tactics.


30
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:34,876
And so I went out and got a
helpful quotation from Wikipedia


31
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:37,856
to sort of think about
what the difference


32
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:40,496
between strategy and tactics is.


33
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:44,866
And so tactics are the actual
means used to gain an objective,


34
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,706
while strategy is the
overall campaign plan,


35
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,856
which may involve complex
operational patterns, activity


36
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:53,386
and decision-making that
lead to tactical execution.


37
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:56,356
Certainly, the complex
operational pattern sounds


38
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:58,716
like programming to me, right?


39
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:00,416
Definitely.


40
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,476
So I think that really sort


41
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:06,336
of strategy is you're having a
big idea of what you might want


42
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:09,876
to do, and that really should
hopefully be driving what you


43
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,946
actually do to accomplish
the goal, right?


44
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:15,636
So today I'd like to talk
about some of these ideas,


45
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,676
these high level
ideas that inspire


46
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:19,706
and inform my everyday work.


47
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:24,426
But really this session
is not sort of how


48
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,826
to make a great project
in 21 days, right?


49
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,786
I mean it's not going to be,
it's never that simple, right?


50
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,756
Every time you see
something like that X


51
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:36,056
or 21 days it's never,
ever, ever that simple.


52
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:40,276
So it's not simple; you
kind of need a plan for kind


53
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:41,846
of attacking the problem here.


54
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:46,506
And so today how I'm going
to do that is tell you some


55
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:50,016
of my stories, projects
that I've been involved in.


56
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:52,946
But, you know, but there's
kind of like a note of caution


57
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:55,586
when you hear stories
and maybe try


58
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,326
to apply it to your own life.


59
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:58,676
And I have an example here.


60
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:01,606
Let's say you're in Las
Vegas and you see somebody go


61
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:04,076
by who is carrying
a big pile of chips


62
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:07,006
over to get them cashed in,
and you stop the person.


63
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:10,116
You say, "Wait, what did you do
to get that big pile of chips?"


64
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,336
And the answer comes,
"I put it all on 14."


65
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:21,656
Okay, so it's true, but not
so useful to you, right?


66
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:23,706
You go over and put
it on 14, you may


67
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:26,306
or may not get the same
result, most likely not.


68
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,226
So hopefully the stories
will be interesting to you,


69
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,796
but the real goal before, during
and after the story, right,


70
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:38,446
particularly after is to extract
out the lessons from the stories


71
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:42,056
because I think the
lessons if you take them


72
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,926
in the aggregate starts
stringing together some lessons.


73
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:47,626
That sort of points
toward a strategy,


74
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,886
it certainly does for me.


75
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:55,516
So today eight stories, 11
lessons, take all those lessons,


76
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:59,646
put them together and really
that is what informs my work.


77
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,036
And, again, of course, I'm
always trying to do great work,


78
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,076
so hopefully this
will all come together


79
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,296
in a nice big circle at the end.


80
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:09,046
So to begin with the stories.


81
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:13,936
Number one, the story is
"Like a Crystal Ball,"


82
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:19,356
and the lesson is know a
good idea when you see it.


83
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:25,206
So I joined Apple in June of
2001, and if you think back


84
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:30,606
to that time, Mac OS X,
version 10.0, was released


85
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,626
about three months before.


86
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,496
Now that's kind of
a long time ago.


87
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,006
When you think about
it the browser


88
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:40,446
on the platform was
Microsoft Internet Explorer,


89
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,326
and that's the browser
that's shipped


90
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:45,756
with the operating
system from Apple.


91
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:52,066
Not only that, there
was no framework to load


92
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:55,236
and render web content, right?


93
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:57,166
So we just had an
app, but no framework.


94
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,566
So my job, along with someone
else, a fellow named Don,


95
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,646
we joined the same day.


96
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,506
Our job became make
Apple a web browser


97
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,996
and an Objective-C
Framework, too.


98
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:11,006
Again, load and render web
content and make that available


99
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,226
as an API to you all,
to the developers.


100
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:18,466
So we started looking
at some options.


101
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,466
Well, what were the options
available at the time?


102
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:23,636
And you see sort of the
leading candidates there.


103
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:28,366
Some of these were commercial
products, kind of a buy option.


104
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:31,376
Some of them were Open
Source projects out there


105
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,676
in the world going on.


106
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:35,716
We could go and make perhaps,


107
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:37,516
adopt that source
code for our project.


108
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:38,726
We could also start
from scratch,


109
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:42,116
we considered it, absolutely.


110
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:45,606
So my job was to begin to do
some technical investigation


111
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:49,276
of particularly the
Open Source options.


112
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,916
And I downloaded Mozilla.


113
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,626
There's one story, I took
about a week, I remember,


114
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:59,886
to try to just get Mozilla
to build on the Mac.


115
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:05,506
And I remember at one point one
of the steps in this long recipe


116
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,956
of steps that needed to get
done to get Mozilla to build,


117
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,136
I needed to rebuild the C,


118
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:14,056
metro work C library,
was one of the steps.


119
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:16,226
So this was not a
straightforward thing,


120
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,236
but I eventually got it
building and, you know, okay.


121
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:23,696
But this process went
on for weeks, and I went


122
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:26,126
and got these programs.


123
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,006
The commercial products,
you know,


124
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:29,896
what I did for that
was got them running


125
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:32,676
and started doing some
performance analysis


126
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:34,966
and say Unicode compatibility.


127
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:38,616
And so between the commercial
products, those test results,


128
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:41,786
and the Open Source projects,
some sort of reckoning


129
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:45,236
of how much source code was
there, how easy it would be


130
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,586
to adapt it and so forth.


131
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:49,836
Some test results, I
printed out on paper,


132
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:54,116
but I didn't have a demo.


133
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:56,376
No demo, just test results.


134
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:59,996
So right about that time we
got a new engineer on our team,


135
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:00,836
a fellow named Richard.


136
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:05,596
And so I showed him, described
to him basically as I described


137
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:09,066
to you what I'd been doing,
showed him the test results.


138
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,976
And he said really what
have you been doing?


139
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,876
Six weeks and this
is all you have?


140
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,716
So I was like, well, yeah.


141
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,606
I just kind of shrugged and
said that's what I have.


142
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,296
So he just didn't
think very much


143
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,796
of that, and so he went away.


144
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:24,606
And two days later
he had a demo.


145
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,906
He took one of those
options, KHTML,


146
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,636
which is the web rendering
engine that was part


147
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:35,596
of the KDE desktop
environment for Linux.


148
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:39,216
He grabbed that source code,
got it running on a Mac,


149
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,986
just did whatever kind of
hacks that he needed to do


150
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:48,626
to get it running, and had
Konqueror, the KDE's browser,


151
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:51,796
running on a Mac in an X window.


152
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,286
This was amazing.


153
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:58,336
It was absolutely amazing.


154
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:00,406
We were just standing
there and like looking


155
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:03,926
at a browser running on
the Mac, that's like --


156
00:08:04,346 --> 00:08:09,376
it was like a crystal ball,
it was absolutely amazing.


157
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:12,846
And we saw all the people who
were involved in, you know -


158
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:15,036
not only us on the project,
but then decision makers


159
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,476
at the company - saw that
KHTML was our future.


160
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,926
This was just like he'd opened


161
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,276
up this tunnel to,
like, the future.


162
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:24,976
It was absolutely amazing.


163
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:29,896
And so the lesson from
this experience is


164
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,236
to know a good idea
when you see it.


165
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:36,956
I mean really for me, I kind
of felt like a bumbling idiot.


166
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:41,186
There I was for six weeks
trying to figure out what to do


167
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:44,506
and really had nothing,
and someone new came in


168
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:48,836
and in two days he had
the future right there


169
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:49,736
that we could use.


170
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:53,446
Now sort of the sub-lesson


171
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,256
for this is really
what does this mean,


172
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:56,366
know a good idea
when you see it?


173
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:59,346
Is even if something like this
happens to you and you're made


174
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:01,556
to look like an idiot,
it doesn't matter.


175
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:02,346
I didn't care.


176
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:04,226
It shouldn't matter
to you either


177
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:06,696
because there's actually
some, a couple of good things


178
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,256
about this experience.


179
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:11,396
Number one, I had a great new
team member who I was going


180
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:14,236
to be now involved with, who was
going to be helping me to kind


181
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:19,336
of make this project happen,
and he really proved in two days


182
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:22,056
that he was really good.


183
00:09:22,056 --> 00:09:24,906
And so it was just like,
boy, the next day, well,


184
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:26,406
we kind of know what
to do, right?


185
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,366
We're going to start
making this future real.


186
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:34,346
And so that's kind of the
story of "Like a Crystal Ball,"


187
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:36,876
but there's a bonus
lesson here, too.


188
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,036
Not only know a good
idea when you see it,


189
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:44,496
but kind of this extra lesson
of make demos and prototypes.


190
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:48,496
If you're starting on
a new idea don't --


191
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:52,176
test results, that's all well
and good, but you should also


192
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:56,696
at the same time make something
that you can actually begin


193
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:00,996
to use like you want to use the
real thing that you're going


194
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,596
to be making ultimately
in the future.


195
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,866
Get that, open up your own
tunnel to the future, right?


196
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:12,076
Get something in front of you
and working as soon as you can.


197
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,346
So that's "Like a Crystal
Ball": Know a good idea


198
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:17,466
when you see it, and make
demos and prototypes.


199
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:27,186
So the next story, number
two, is "The Black Obelisk,"


200
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,556
and the lesson is don't try to
solve every problem at once.


201
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,896
So continuing right
on from the end


202
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,506
of that last story:
KHTML, fantastic.


203
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:39,086
The more we looked at the code,
the more we were confident


204
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:42,826
that this was really
the way for us to go.


205
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:44,746
But really what do
we do now, right?


206
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,856
I mean what do we do, right?


207
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:50,136
And so, as you can imagine,
Open Source we go and it's part


208
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:55,126
of the KDE desktop, so we went
and we downloaded all of KDE.


209
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,716
But the thing is we
only wanted KHTML,


210
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:02,266
only the HTML rendering
engine, and we also wanted KJS,


211
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,526
the JavaScript engine.


212
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:08,046
So the job became to
sort of draw a line


213
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:13,176
around just the HTML part of
this whole desktop environment


214
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,236
so that we could just
extract that and use it.


215
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:19,446
And this turned out to be
about 100 source files.


216
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,476
It seems tractable.


217
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,976
So the next step was to bring
those files over to the Mac


218
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,876
and start compiling them,
one at a time, right?


219
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:31,746
Of course, it didn't compile


220
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:33,256
because we just took
this source code


221
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:36,546
that expected this whole other
desktop environment around it,


222
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:40,766
and now we just sort of pulled
the whole rug out from under it.


223
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:42,966
So, you know, it didn't compile.


224
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:45,116
We had a whole bunch
of missing things,


225
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:47,946
and so we just began
stubbing them in,


226
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:49,816
stubbing in missing
functions one at a time.


227
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,456
And these were very,
very light stubs.


228
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:56,166
These were only stubs
in header files, right?


229
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,256
So we only wanted to sort of
define the problem in terms


230
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:02,916
of all of the missing things
that we needed to add.


231
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,686
This was very, very slow work.


232
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,246
It took about another six
weeks - six weeks was kind


233
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:10,696
of a magical number
for this project.


234
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,316
This took about six
weeks of just compiling.


235
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:19,086
It would be like 10, 11 hours
of compiling every single day.


236
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:24,486
So it was pretty
painstaking, and then even


237
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:25,996
at this step nothing linked


238
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,256
because as I mentioned
these are only header files.


239
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:30,106
So we were only running,
we weren't --


240
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:31,956
I made a custom make file,
I said don't even try


241
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:36,036
to run the linker, just like try
to show us what we were missing.


242
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:42,646
So after we were done with that,
right, we had another six weeks


243
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:46,366
to get everything to link,
actually going in and finishing


244
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,116
out sort of the header
file, actually putting


245
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:52,126
in some stub implementation
for everything.


246
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:55,396
And even then we had lots
of crashes because in a lot


247
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:56,906
of functions that
returned strings,


248
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,866
we returned empty strings,


249
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,416
and obviously that's
not really what a lot


250
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,506
of the code was expecting.


251
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:05,956
So we also added in a
whole lot of log statements


252
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:09,356
to our implementation, saying,
yes, this is not implemented


253
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,156
at all, I mean it
returns a value,


254
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:14,596
but sort of not implemented
at all, partially implemented.


255
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:16,736
Yes, we think we're pretty
close, and implement it.


256
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:21,846
So we had a whole bunch of log
statements that we would see;


257
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:24,646
we had a whole bunch of messages
getting written to the log


258
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:26,366
as we actually tried
to use the program.


259
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:29,616
And after this whole
process of many, many weeks,


260
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:33,756
we eventually wound up with a
Mac program that used KHTML,


261
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:37,576
and then one day
the lights came on.


262
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:40,006
So my coworker, Richard, was
actually off on vacation.


263
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:42,036
He was really kind of
doing this, sort of leading


264
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,926
up the effort to get things
to link and not crash so much,


265
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,066
and then I came in and
took over the process


266
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:52,756
and actually got the first
thing to draw on the screen.


267
00:13:53,236 --> 00:14:01,326
So I loaded a URL, in this
case www.yahoo.com, and reams


268
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,556
and reams and reams
of log messages go by,


269
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,066
and the program didn't crash,


270
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:07,606
and then there was a
short pause, and it drew.


271
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:10,956
The Black Obelisk [applause].


272
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:20,276
So this is the first thing
that WebKit, and Safari ever,


273
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,916
you know, what became
Safari, ever rendered.


274
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:26,256
Now, see, it's a little bit of
a secret, as it actually turns


275
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,786
out that this was a reversal,
that Obelisk should have been


276
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:31,926
on the other side of the
screen, but we fixed that sort


277
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:34,226
of little geometry
problem very soon after.


278
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:37,596
But you can imagine that once
I got this going, go ahead


279
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:39,666
and fetched everybody who
was disclosed in the project,


280
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,996
and we're all sitting
around sort of like


281
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:46,966
"2001 Space Odyssey" with this
Black Obelisk, going "whoo."


282
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:49,926
So that was a very
happy, happy moment.


283
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:54,906
Now the lesson from this
experience is don't try


284
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:56,316
to solve every problem at once.


285
00:14:56,386 --> 00:15:00,226
At this point we had
almost no knowledge


286
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,556
of now the innards
of KHTML worked.


287
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,906
This was simply a
mechanical process


288
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:11,136
of making the compiler happy,
making the linker happy,


289
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,276
making it so the program
didn't crash when we tried


290
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:15,146
to do something with it.


291
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,746
It was all very,
very mechanical.


292
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:20,486
The compiler says
there's something missing,


293
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:23,476
go add that thing so that
it's no longer missing, right?


294
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:27,586
Now it turns out, of course, a
web rendering engine is a very,


295
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:29,146
very complicated
piece of software,


296
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:34,076
and but we just didn't have
the bandwidth to think about it


297
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,276
at this point as we were trying


298
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,766
to just get those
lights to come on.


299
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,466
That began to happen as
soon as we had a program


300
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:41,866
that would no longer
crash, right?


301
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,226
So don't care.


302
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:47,076
If you're trying to
attack a new, big problem,


303
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,236
and you've got this big
problem space, particularly


304
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,356
if that problem space is new
to you, just try to figure


305
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:53,726
out what the most
important thing is


306
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,226
to do first and do that.


307
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,846
Don't think about the whole
problem or try to operate


308
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:03,536
on solving the whole
problem at one time, right?


309
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:07,506
So don't try to solve
every problem at once,


310
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:11,106
and that's "The Black Obelisk."


311
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:16,386
So the next story, number
three, is "The Hardest Problem.


312
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:20,886
And the lesson is find smart
friends and listen to them.


313
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:24,106
So fast forward to
the fall of 2003,


314
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:27,356
and my job became
editing to WebKit.


315
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,956
So we wanted to use WebKit
to edit HTML mail in mail.app


316
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:36,936
on Mac OS X, and we wanted to
make editing in WebKit look


317
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:39,276
and work like a text
editor, okay?


318
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:43,116
So the problem that
we were trying


319
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:44,966
to solve is somewhat
obvious, right?


320
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:49,036
A lot of other platforms,
in particular Windows,


321
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:52,756
sends HTML mail from
Outlook, and we wanted


322
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:55,656
to not only render it, which we
could now that we had WebKit,


323
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,616
but we also wanted to edit it.


324
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:59,056
Because if you think about it,


325
00:16:59,056 --> 00:17:02,386
before WebKit had editing
the web content would show


326
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:05,665
up in your mail message as an
attachment in our TF document


327
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,695
with a big blinking
insertion point after it,


328
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:09,586
you could just kind of delete
the whole thing with one --


329
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:13,066
delete an entire web
page with one back space.


330
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,326
So that's not what we wanted,
we wanted to be able to get


331
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,056
into the details
of the web content


332
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,016
so we could edit it, right?


333
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:24,006
So now, the hardest problem I
have ever, ever worked on in my,


334
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,786
well, many, many years


335
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:29,626
of programming is arrow
navigation through web content.


336
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:30,906
Now what do I mean by that?


337
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:35,826
So picture a tiny little
web document, like this,


338
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,906
and what you do then is you hit
the arrow key the right number


339
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:41,696
of times and the insertion
point winds up at the end.


340
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:44,556
That's it: just go
character by character,


341
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:45,686
have the insertion point show


342
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:48,086
up in the right place each
time you press the arrow key,


343
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,226
and then similarly
press the arrow key


344
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:52,136
to go back the other way


345
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:53,856
and send the insertion
point back to the start.


346
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:54,876
That was it.


347
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:57,456
This turned out to be
very, very difficult.


348
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,426
Now why is this?


349
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:01,426
Because, you know, unlike
say an RTF document,


350
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:04,656
which is just a series of
characters and indexes into,


351
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,926
basically an array
of characters,


352
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:10,466
web content is a tree structure.


353
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:14,796
So if you see on the top
where the insertion point is


354
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:19,096
at the end, and then if you look
at the model, the web document,


355
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:21,416
the insertion point
would blink at the end


356
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:26,936
if in the web document, the
insertion point was there


357
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:32,076
or there or there
or there, right?


358
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:35,046
So what I had here was a
complex model of view relations


359
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:39,736
where the model changed, but
the view didn't change, right?


360
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:43,266
So now to begin thinking
about this I used the DOM,


361
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,286
the web DOM, the
document object model,


362
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:49,486
the API for addressing web
content, and used positions


363
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,956
in the web content
to try to understand


364
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,816
where to make the
insertion point blink.


365
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:57,556
And so, as I just illustrated,
I came up with this notion


366
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,116
of then equivalent
DOM positions.


367
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:04,306
DOM positions that would
make different DOM positions,


368
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,086
but that would make the
insertion point blink


369
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:07,966
in the same spot, okay?


370
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:12,636
So I started writing some
code: very simple, right arrow,


371
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:15,576
algorithm here, get the
insertion point position


372
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,536
in a DOM position,
then find this function


373
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:21,296
and use this function,
equivalent downstream position


374
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,466
to find the DOM position


375
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,956
that would still make
the insertion point blink


376
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,366
in the same spot, but was closer
to the end of the document.


377
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,256
And then go to the next position


378
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:32,696
and then set the
insertion point there.


379
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:35,476
Now that seems reasonable,
but kind of focus


380
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:38,866
in on these two important
functions here, right?


381
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:40,716
Well, naturally it's
just a program, right?


382
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:43,196
I mean so if you wanted perfect
results the functions need


383
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:43,996
to work perfectly.


384
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,276
And the problem with that was


385
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,456
that equivalent downstream
position was implemented


386
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,446
in terms of get next
DOM position,


387
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:54,276
so sometimes I would have
this feedback process going


388
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,726
where bizarre things happened
because a bug would then feed


389
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:00,716
into itself, right, and cause
something that was very,


390
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:03,976
very difficult to understand
and diagnose simply by looking


391
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:06,356
at the result in the view.


392
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:09,346
So it was complicated,
right, to get right.


393
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,156
And then other issues
come up, as well.


394
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,536
What if you're already at
the end of the document,


395
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,326
the visual end of the document?


396
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:18,746
As you know, if you've
ever probably viewed source


397
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:22,026
on an HTML document, there's
often many, many things,


398
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,516
at the very least sort


399
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:26,026
of a closing body
tag, closing HTML tag.


400
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,046
A lot of times there's
script content.


401
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:30,716
There might be style content.


402
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:34,886
There could be any sort of
information that's not visible


403
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,956
after the visible
end of the document.


404
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:40,626
And by DOM position it will,
you know, if you just kind


405
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:43,156
of send it off to a position
it will merrily go there,


406
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:45,336
and there won't be a place for
the insertion point to blink,


407
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:46,526
so this was a problem, as well.


408
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:49,276
And then what if you
want to move by word


409
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,126
because the ultimate goal was
to make a text editor, right?


410
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,716
So you hold down the
option key and arrow,


411
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:56,446
and then you move word by word,
not character by character.


412
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:59,386
And so I was nowhere,
I was stuck.


413
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:03,326
I was working on this,
well, just for the sake


414
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,566
of argument say six
weeks, the magical number,


415
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:11,006
but for many weeks
without really feeling


416
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:12,376
like I was making progress.


417
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:13,636
So I asked for help,


418
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:16,636
and fortunately I had some
very smart people in my team,


419
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,456
which of course the
other stories have


420
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,416
already illustrated.


421
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:23,346
And I explained the problem to
them, much as I just did to you,


422
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,816
and their solution
came back very,


423
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:28,106
very clear that DOM
positions were too low level.


424
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,206
I was trying to build
a very complex edifice,


425
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:36,036
but I was using too
fundamental an abstraction


426
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:37,936
to get the job done.


427
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:39,356
So I needed a more
powerful abstraction.


428
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:40,736
So they came up with
one, they gave me one.


429
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,946
They called it VisiblePosition.


430
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:46,686
And all this was, this is C++
code, so this is C++ class


431
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,926
that represented a
place in a document


432
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:51,166
where the insertion
point can blink,


433
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:55,766
and then secondarily a
library called visible-units


434
00:21:57,006 --> 00:21:58,886
that could take a
VisiblePosition and move


435
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:01,406
by words, lines and
documents, okay?


436
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:02,826
So they gave me this design.


437
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:07,276
Now the point is that I
still had the hard work


438
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:14,516
of figuring everything out, but
now I had a complete outline


439
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:19,656
of all the code that I needed,
every place, word by word, well,


440
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,976
I knew now there was actually
a place in the document,


441
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:25,606
there was a stub function
that was where the move word


442
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:29,096
by word code should go,
where that should live.


443
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:34,806
And so this, really this set of
abstractions really helped me


444
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:37,066
to just organize
the work and figure


445
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,446
out where this solution
should live.


446
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:41,656
It also made it easier to
think about the problem


447
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:44,716
so that I wound up with fewer
of these kind of functions


448
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:47,826
that fed back on each other
producing bizarre results.


449
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:52,306
So when you're blocked
don't be blocked.


450
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:55,516
Find smart friends
and listen to them.


451
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:58,476
In this case they said
VisiblePositions, visible-units.


452
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:06,736
I said, OK, I will do that, and
it worked, it absolutely worked.


453
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:09,336
I certainly went back and
got some more of their help,


454
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:11,436
some details, but this
was the big, big help.


455
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:13,296
Find smart friends
and listen to them,


456
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:14,836
particularly when you're stuck.


457
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,236
Do not stay blocked.


458
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:21,436
And this is how I got through
my hardest programming problem.


459
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:30,416
And so the next story,
number four, is "QWERTY,"


460
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:34,216
and the lesson is work
should explain itself.


461
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:38,296
So fast forward to 2005 now,


462
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:43,356
and I joined the iPhone
development project pretty


463
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:44,016
early on.


464
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:48,226
And initially I joined to work
on WebKit because it seemed


465
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,266
like a good match for my
skills and experience at Apple,


466
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:54,126
but I soon transitioned
to work on keyboards.


467
00:23:57,076 --> 00:24:00,166
So now if you think about
it, right, and this is kind


468
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:03,396
of what we had when we
started with the iPhone.


469
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:06,676
We had a screen, and
we had this notion


470
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:08,906
that the keyboard
would be on the bottom


471
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,386
and the app content
would be on the top.


472
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:13,056
And, of course, the
big question was, well,


473
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,546
what should the keyboard
do, how should it work,


474
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:17,686
what should it look like?


475
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:20,686
And if you had seen even


476
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:23,596
from the very beginning the
Steve Jobs' announcement


477
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:27,046
of the iPhone, the original
announcement in 2007,


478
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:30,006
he pointed out very,
very clearly this virtue


479
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:32,766
of the iPhone that it didn't
have those plastic keys


480
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:35,626
on the bottom, we could draw
the keyboard and make it look


481
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:36,816
like whatever we wanted.


482
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:42,066
So now jumping back to the
beginning of that story,


483
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:45,386
because Steve on stage was
the end of that story, right,


484
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:49,036
we didn't have plastic keys
so we needed to experiment


485
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,316
of what we were going
to do, right?


486
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:53,636
How were we going to
replace those plastic keys


487
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:54,306
with software?


488
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:59,396
And we came up with many, many
ideas for how we would do this.


489
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:02,666
Now there are a lot of
challenges, particularly


490
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,756
at the beginning, when we
were all new with dealing


491
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:07,936
with a touchscreen keyboard,
particularly touchscreens


492
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:11,286
in general and touchscreen
keyboards, specifically.


493
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,106
So one of the challenges is
that small targets are hard


494
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:15,686
to tap, it's pretty logical.


495
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,676
I'm sure you even
experienced that now,


496
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:20,866
the smaller the targets get the
more difficult they are to tap.


497
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:26,356
And not only that, but as you go
for a target, as you get close


498
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:29,296
to it your finger covers up the
thing that you're looking for,


499
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,876
so the smaller that it is
the more difficult it is


500
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:34,536
to do some fine-grained
adjustments as you get close.


501
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:38,076
So these were - we,
in our experiments,


502
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:40,356
we were seeing the result.


503
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:41,496
This was very challenging


504
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,946
to make a keyboard
that worked, at all.


505
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:45,846
And so in the beginning,
we were pretty clear,


506
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:47,666
or at least we thought
we were clear,


507
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:50,356
that bigger keys would
be the solution -


508
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:52,196
this would solve both problems.


509
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:57,986
So I have an example of
something in the spirit of one


510
00:25:57,986 --> 00:26:01,496
of the experiments we
tried, not an exact example,


511
00:26:01,756 --> 00:26:03,926
but something very, very much
in the spirit of what we tried,


512
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:05,426
and I call it the
keyboard keyboard


513
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:08,336
because if you think about, you
know, other things in the world


514
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:10,716
that accept a lot of
touch input, right,


515
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:13,916
well it's a piano
keyboard, right?


516
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:17,986
So you could maybe conceive of
a keyboard that looks like this.


517
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,156
So now how does this work?


518
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:22,906
Well, I'm going to try to -
I'm going to type the T key,


519
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:24,626
and so how do you get a T?


520
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:28,496
Well, you look on all the
keys, and you do make a chord,


521
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:36,846
multitouch motion, to find all
the keys that have a T on it.


522
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,006
Okay, so then we could go T.


523
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:44,946
H, H has actually got two of the
same keys as T, but H is only


524
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:47,496
on those two keys
and the, T-H-E.


525
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:50,116
So you can see how
this would work, right,


526
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:51,766
a chording keyboard, right?


527
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:55,606
And this is good
because the keys are big.


528
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,696
You can even maybe think of like
it's just like home keys, right?


529
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:01,806
You just kind of keep your
five fingers right on top


530
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:05,526
of the keys and, you know, you
can use the keyboard like that.


531
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:08,036
And so it's easy to press the
correct key, so that's good,


532
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:10,366
but it's bad because there's
a learning curve, right?


533
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:13,766
The first-time experience
is a mystery.


534
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,886
You see this alphabet soup
on this thing that looks


535
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:17,746
like a piano keyboard.


536
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:19,506
Well, how do I use this, right?


537
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,286
And so we were thinking
that, well,


538
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:23,506
the solution would be
we'd have a tutorial


539
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:25,976
to teach the people how
to use the keyboard.


540
00:27:26,356 --> 00:27:29,666
Now it's actually, you know,
this is not - this is an idea


541
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:32,706
that actually has
some history at Apple


542
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:35,416
because the original Mac
shipped with a tutorial


543
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:37,416
to teach people how
to use the mouse,


544
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,546
since that was new, right?


545
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,516
So we figured we'd come up
with a tutorial, and you think


546
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:47,496
about it, is that
even if we didn't have


547
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:49,456
that keyboard keyboard,
but if you imagine


548
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:51,546
that if we did we could maybe
even come up with a keyboard


549
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:53,406
that used music to
try to teach people


550
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,306
that you could maybe
play a tune, right?


551
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,476
So it wasn't the craziest
idea in the world.


552
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,576
But after each of these
experiments and each


553
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:04,186
of the times that we thought
through how to make a tutorial,


554
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:07,456
we always came back to QWERTY


555
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:11,116
because you all already
know how to use it.


556
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:15,246
There's no need for
a tutorial, right?


557
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:18,516
You see the thing,
and instead of, gosh,


558
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:21,046
what is this, and
how do I use it?


559
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:26,106
Right? Instead of that you have
this, where you look at it and,


560
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:28,056
okay, it's different
because it's a touchscreen


561
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:33,456
and it's small, but we're sort
of calling on and invoking,


562
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:36,636
right, a lot of these kind
of these familiar notions


563
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:38,826
that you're already very,
very comfortable with.


564
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:43,306
So that's why we wound up with
this and ultimately, right,


565
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:48,686
we have this today because we
thought it was more important


566
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:52,166
that the work should
explain itself, right?


567
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:53,926
You already know
how to use QWERTY.


568
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:55,326
We don't need a tutorial.


569
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:58,956
And so this was really
the key to that decision,


570
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:03,336
key I guess is a funny
word, but it's the keyboard.


571
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:07,866
But it's the real reason why we
chose to go with QWERTY because,


572
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:13,976
again, we thought that
work should explain itself.


573
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:18,636
So the next story, number five,
"Every Word on Every Keystroke."


574
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:23,416
And so the lesson is choose the
simplest thing which might work.


575
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:28,076
So continuing on
in the development


576
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:31,296
of the iPhone keyboard, it
became my job to do the work


577
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:32,566
to make QWERTY possible, right?


578
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:37,016
We had this challenge of small
keys, difficult to tap now,


579
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:40,166
and of course you all don't
care about my problems,


580
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:43,426
you just want to type quickly.


581
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:45,996
So the software was
going to need to help.


582
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:50,236
And so the eventual solution
for that was auto correction,


583
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:53,886
which is, of course, what you
meant and not what you did,


584
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:57,126
taking what you did and figured
out what you meant from it.


585
00:29:57,716 --> 00:30:04,446
And, of course, there's quite a
bit of smart people have thought


586
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:10,426
about text processing
and text prediction,


587
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:14,366
and so some of the terms that
are in the state of the art,


588
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:17,256
you know, then as now
Bayesian statistics


589
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:19,886
and Stochastic programming,
Conditional Random Fields.


590
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:24,126
And a lot of these involve
large statistical models


591
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:27,856
to make them work, that they
rely on, language models.


592
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:32,346
And these were not going to
be possible given the hardware


593
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,206
and software environment
of the original iPhone.


594
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:38,506
Not only that, but
I last studied math


595
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:42,516
in the eleventh grade,
which was in the'80s,


596
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:43,946
and it was in the early'80s.


597
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:49,316
So I was kind of looking
at Stochastic programming,


598
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:50,596
oh, okay, well, you know.


599
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:53,166
So really what I decided was
I needed something simple


600
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,566
because math is hard, okay?


601
00:30:56,516 --> 00:31:00,846
[ Applause ]


602
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:07,906
And so here is a little bit
of an idea, a little bit


603
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:11,406
as to how this auto
correction works, right?


604
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:15,756
Certainly, in the, you know,
way back then and the first time


605
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,906
that I tried to get
this idea together.


606
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,636
So you're typing a letter, "I."


607
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:24,766
Well, since the keys are small
maybe you meant those keys,


608
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:25,306
as well.


609
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:28,676
So "I" was highlighted,
but maybe you missed


610
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:31,446
and maybe you meant one
of the keys around "I."


611
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:35,226
Okay, and then you type a
T, and, well, similarly,


612
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,576
maybe you meant one of
those letters around it.


613
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,376
So even just with
two characters,


614
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:42,726
you can see that there are
a number of possibilities.


615
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:44,246
All right.


616
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:47,836
And so in one column are
words that are real words


617
00:31:47,836 --> 00:31:49,606
and are going to be in
an English dictionary,


618
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:54,486
and in the other column there
are just those words that are -


619
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:57,196
they're letter combinations,
but they're not words.


620
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:02,616
We have words that, the one
column has words that are


621
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:06,816
in the dictionary and the
other column has just letter


622
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:08,056
combinations that aren't words.


623
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,596
And so what do you do with this?


624
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,356
This is now raw material, right?


625
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:17,266
And so auto correction, really
ultimately sort of a big part


626
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:19,736
of it, is just speculation,
you know.


627
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:20,906
Did you mean this one?


628
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:21,676
Did you mean that one?


629
00:32:21,676 --> 00:32:22,396
Did you mean the other one?


630
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:23,016
Did you mean this one?


631
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:23,636
Did you mean this one?


632
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:25,546
And this involved many, many,


633
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:28,606
many dictionary lookups
to just check.


634
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:29,956
Are these letter combinations?


635
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:31,456
Are these words in
the dictionary


636
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:33,826
that is selected by the user?


637
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:37,536
So I needed something that
worked really, really fast.


638
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:42,946
And so the idea was offered to
me that, well, you could maybe


639
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:44,766
as the user is typing
just kind of send


640
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:48,076
that dictionary lookup stuff
on a background thread and sort


641
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,636
of post the results
back when it's done.


642
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,976
And, of course, being back
then we didn't have GCD,


643
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:54,776
and so the Pthreads would
have been the solution.


644
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,646
And it's like, I'm scared
of multithreaded code.


645
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:58,686
It's hard; it's hard
to get right.


646
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,816
I'll tell you a secret, it's
just like there was actually -


647
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,406
I did have one little
bit of multithreaded code


648
00:33:04,656 --> 00:33:07,196
in the keyboard in the beginning
to do some initialization,


649
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:09,886
and that was as large
a source of bugs -


650
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:12,456
it was a tiny little piece
of code, and that was


651
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,996
as large a source of bugs,
dealing with app startup


652
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:18,936
and you launch an app and then
suspend it, it was a huge source


653
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:22,796
of bugs even if it was
just a little bit of code.


654
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:24,536
And so I wanted to
keep multithreading


655
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,776
out of auto correction, which
was much more complex, right?


656
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,616
Because I wanted us
to keep things simple


657
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,216
because I can understand simple.


658
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:35,176
All right, multithreading
is hard.


659
00:33:35,176 --> 00:33:37,606
I can't even like make
an egg and breakfast


660
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:38,356
in the morning, right?


661
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:40,836
I make the egg, make
coffee, then make the egg,


662
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,986
keep it single threaded, right?


663
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:46,016
Because otherwise I wind
up with a messy kitchen.


664
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:47,666
OK, so keep it simple.


665
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:51,976
So here is actually
a little algorithm


666
00:33:52,106 --> 00:33:53,156
for searching a dictionary.


667
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:55,936
Word list on one side,


668
00:33:56,656 --> 00:34:00,396
and a little algorithm
on the other side.


669
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:03,746
And this was actually
thought up by the same fellow


670
00:34:03,746 --> 00:34:05,116
who did the KHTML demo.


671
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,956
And so he came up with that
good idea, and as part of some


672
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:10,746
of our other experiments,
and, boy,


673
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:13,286
I saw that good idea
and I used it.


674
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:13,936
So what do you do?


675
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:17,406
You have a list of words in a
dictionary, you memory map it,


676
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:20,295
you iterate the list once
to find the line endings,


677
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,786
you store those addresses
in a pointer array,


678
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:25,876
you can then binary search and
you can find whether a word is


679
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:28,545
in the dictionary
really, really fast.


680
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:31,466
Really, really fast, and so next


681
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:33,596
after that I wrote a
custom C++ string class


682
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:38,076
that could wrap any string
in that memory map area.


683
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,626
Each of those strings were
null terminated on the end,


684
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:43,176
so you could just kind of
go and wrap an address,


685
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:46,896
and you have a string, as long
as you're at a line start.


686
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:49,005
And so this turned out to
be really, really fast.


687
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,766
I could check dictionary
membership in microseconds,


688
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:55,036
even on the original
iPhone hardware.


689
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:57,696
So this was now really,
really fast.


690
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:01,116
And so what this did was
it made speculation really,


691
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:05,666
really cheap, and that in turn
made auto correction possible.


692
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:11,796
So I could go from this and
take all of those permutations,


693
00:35:11,836 --> 00:35:15,796
even for as long a word as
you might find in a language,


694
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:20,726
and actually go and figure out
whether that word is going to be


695
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:21,806
in the dictionary or not


696
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,336
and whether similar
options would be as well.


697
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:26,646
And this turned out
to be so fast


698
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:29,626
that I stored no state
for the current word.


699
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:31,426
I didn't store previous results.


700
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:34,426
All I did was actually store the
string for the user's typing.


701
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:38,186
If we think back here, all
I've had stored is I T.


702
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:39,416
What have you typed?


703
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:42,436
The actual characters
that were lit up, right?


704
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:43,506
Not the neighboring ones.


705
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,556
But the only thing
stored was the characters


706
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:47,956
that were lit up, okay?


707
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,466
So only store that string.


708
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:52,396
So it's actually, I reran
the entire algorithm


709
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:57,646
on every keystroke from
scratch, which means of course


710
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:58,736
that it searched the
whole dictionary,


711
00:35:58,736 --> 00:36:01,986
70,000 plus words,
on every keystroke.


712
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:06,036
Because, to me, this
was the simplest thing,


713
00:36:06,036 --> 00:36:07,276
as I was thinking about it,


714
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,576
it was the simplest
thing which might work.


715
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:12,696
And by coming up with
sufficiently fast


716
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:15,006
implementations of this,


717
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,056
it turned out that the
simplest thing did work.


718
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:21,926
Simple is often speedy,


719
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,296
and simple was something
I could understand.


720
00:36:26,586 --> 00:36:28,576
And when there are
bugs I could understand


721
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:30,186
where those bugs
might have been,


722
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:35,486
and that's every word
on every keystroke.


723
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:38,646
Choose the simplest
thing which might work.


724
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:41,556
And again if you're kind of
looking from the beginning


725
00:36:41,556 --> 00:36:44,766
of a project trying to think
to the end of a project


726
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,706
and what you might have
when you're all done,


727
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:48,246
that's why it's termed this way,


728
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:49,906
choose the simplest
thing which might work.


729
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:52,156
If you did actually have a
crystal ball you could tell


730
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:53,476
whether maybe your
idea would work.


731
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:55,626
But I think this is,
even from the beginning,


732
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:57,986
if you kind of think
of the simplest thing


733
00:36:57,986 --> 00:37:00,716
which could possibly just
give you what you need,


734
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:02,136
go with that first.


735
00:37:02,326 --> 00:37:04,306
I think that's a good idea.


736
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:11,326
And so the next story,
number six,


737
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:13,966
is "We Only Need One
of These, Right?"


738
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:17,436
And the lesson is only
show your best work.


739
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:22,296
And so fast forward to 2009.


740
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,696
I joined the efforts
to develop the iPad,


741
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:27,836
and the iPad needed a keyboard,


742
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:31,876
and so it's by this point I had
two signs pasted onto my back -


743
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,646
one said "Kick me,"
and the other one said


744
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:34,646
"Because keyboards."


745
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:42,466
So it was sort of something
that seemed to be in my area.


746
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:45,636
And so I noticed that in
landscape, you turn an iPad


747
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:49,176
to landscape, that the number
of keys that you could fit


748
00:37:49,176 --> 00:37:51,066
across the top was
close to the size


749
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,606
of a full-sized desktop
keyboard.


750
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:56,476
And so here is a representation


751
00:37:56,476 --> 00:38:00,346
of a full-sized desktop
keyboard, and there is the size


752
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,486
of the keys that we
could fit on an iPad.


753
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:05,006
And if you see, overlay
one on top


754
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:07,836
of the other, it's pretty close.


755
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,806
It's not exact - the iPad
is smaller - but it's close.


756
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:14,656
And so I was thinking
that, hey, well, you know,


757
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,146
it's not exactly the same size,


758
00:38:16,146 --> 00:38:18,346
but auto correction
could maybe help you


759
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:20,046
to type comfortably, right?


760
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:26,006
So, yes, big keys across the top
that seemed like a good idea.


761
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:30,026
But then we also had the
question in our minds of what


762
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:31,276
if you wanted more keys?


763
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,666
We now had space for them.


764
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:34,286
Allocating the space


765
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:37,046
on the original iPhone
keyboard was tortuous


766
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:41,326
because we couldn't even
fit the period character


767
00:38:41,616 --> 00:38:44,396
on the first keyboard
that you saw.


768
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:46,316
We had to put that onto
a secondary key point.


769
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:48,376
And so we didn't
have that problem.


770
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:49,916
Now we could have more keys.


771
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:52,386
We had the room for them,
and so you can imagine


772
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:54,456
that we can start
getting some more keys.


773
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:56,916
In this case I put in
shift and caps lock and tab


774
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:59,306
and a couple extra
characters off at the side.


775
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:01,716
And then I direct your
attention to this here,


776
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:05,666
so we would have a switch that
would allow you to go very,


777
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:12,096
very quickly between the
one with the big keys


778
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:16,516
and then the one
with the more keys.


779
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:20,626
And sort of similar to what we
have where you change to numbers


780
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:23,756
and punctuation, but this was
really keeping the letters the


781
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:26,266
same and just bringing
in more keys.


782
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,496
And so, you know, a bunch of
us who were working on this,


783
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:32,386
we thought this was the
best of both worlds.


784
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:34,646
It was cool, right?


785
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:42,346
So I got to demo this for
Steve, which is a gulp.


786
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:46,876
And so, so bringing
the iPad, you know,


787
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:49,226
you kind of have the demo
room, and go in there and he's


788
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:50,386
in there, and it's
like "He's in there."


789
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:54,596
And then, okay, so you put
the iPad in front of him,


790
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:57,816
and fortunately the
work explained itself,


791
00:39:58,246 --> 00:40:00,826
so the description was
as short as we're looking


792
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:03,796
at iPad keyboard options
today, here are two options,


793
00:40:03,796 --> 00:40:05,536
press the switch key, done.


794
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:07,916
So he did.


795
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,746
He looked at the first keyboard,


796
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:14,026
and he pressed the switch
key, saw the animation.


797
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:16,056
He looked at the
second keyboard,


798
00:40:16,806 --> 00:40:20,346
he pressed the switch key again,
he saw the first one come back.


799
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:23,056
A third time, presses
the switch key,


800
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:27,976
sees the second one come in, and
he looks at this for a moment,


801
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:30,166
and then he looks
up at me and says,


802
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:35,356
"We only need one
of these, right?"


803
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:36,726
And he's looking at me.


804
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,556
And so I gulped a
couple more times.


805
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:48,016
And so and he says, "Well, which
one do you think we should use?"


806
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:52,626
And I said, "Well, you know,
I think we should use the one


807
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:56,146
with the bigger keys because
it's just easier to type,


808
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:57,916
it's close to the size of
a full-sized keyboard."


809
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,806
And he said, "Okay,
we'll go with that one."


810
00:41:00,516 --> 00:41:09,696
[ Laughter & Applause ]


811
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:11,426
And that was it, really.


812
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:13,256
I mean that really was it.


813
00:41:13,256 --> 00:41:16,156
It was just quick, and so
that's why we wound up with this


814
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:18,416
and then ultimately today, this.


815
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:22,216
And, of course, the lesson
is only show your best work.


816
00:41:22,556 --> 00:41:25,966
Perhaps more than anyone
else, Steve understood this.


817
00:41:26,716 --> 00:41:29,586
Go out and think of all
the ideas that you can


818
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:33,426
and not only just think
of the ideas, but get them


819
00:41:33,426 --> 00:41:35,806
and make them and
use them and live


820
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:37,586
with them and think about them.


821
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:41,576
And then try to figure
out which is the best one.


822
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:45,186
So what was interesting
to me about that story is


823
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:47,116
that even though I was
under a lot of pressure,


824
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:51,176
when he asked me which one
I thought was better I knew,


825
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:55,146
but I didn't have the
courage to just go in there


826
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,706
and show him the one


827
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:59,716
that I thought was really
the best the first time.


828
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:03,376
It needed his extra
prodding, that little bit


829
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:05,886
of extra investigation, that
little bit of extra poking


830
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:07,556
to say, wait a minute, right?


831
00:42:07,906 --> 00:42:09,136
Which is the best one?


832
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,506
Which is the second best one?


833
00:42:11,506 --> 00:42:14,506
Let's not show the
second best one, right?


834
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,126
Only show your best work.


835
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:21,996
You have to go through all of
the effort to generate lots


836
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:27,286
of ideas to come up with
one that's really worth it.


837
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:30,386
And that's "We Only Need
One of These, Right?"


838
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:32,776
Only show your best work.


839
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:40,856
Okay, story number seven,
is "Let's Try It 2% Darker,"


840
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:45,036
and the lesson is iterating
quickly leads to better work.


841
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:51,716
And so 2012 I joined the effort
to develop iOS 7 and, of course,


842
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:57,666
as you know one of the big goals
for iOS 7 was a whole new look.


843
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,846
And you ask the question, well,


844
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:01,836
how do you make all
of these choices?


845
00:43:01,836 --> 00:43:04,926
And a lot of times coming up
with these new design ideas,


846
00:43:05,256 --> 00:43:06,996
it felt like a game
of Whac-A-Mole


847
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:10,506
because every decision
affects every other decision


848
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:11,946
that you make, right?


849
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:14,856
You change one thing, and you
have these things over there


850
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:17,286
that kind of familied well with
the thing the way it was before,


851
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:19,486
and now it doesn't seem
like that, now it seems


852
00:43:19,486 --> 00:43:24,356
that the thing that you've just
changed doesn't really work well


853
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:25,616
with everything else.


854
00:43:26,056 --> 00:43:29,426
And so this required a
tremendous amount of tuning,


855
00:43:30,026 --> 00:43:32,116
iterating and iterating
and iterating,


856
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:37,016
version after version,
effort after effort to try


857
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:38,596
to get things so
that they all looked


858
00:43:38,766 --> 00:43:39,766
like they belonged together.


859
00:43:40,676 --> 00:43:45,116
And so if you kind of break
that down from the process


860
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:49,096
of actually trying to do that
work, one design iteration most


861
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:51,946
of the time looks
like this, okay?


862
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:54,926
A guy, like me, will bring
a demo to the designer.


863
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:57,916
The designer will have feedback.


864
00:43:58,346 --> 00:43:59,206
I'll take notes.


865
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:03,536
I'll then go away to
make those changes


866
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:05,586
that the designer has requested.


867
00:44:06,656 --> 00:44:11,336
Then we schedule the next demo,
and then we have that next demo,


868
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:14,596
and we go back to the beginning.


869
00:44:14,596 --> 00:44:17,636
So this process can
take hours or days


870
00:44:18,316 --> 00:44:21,036
because people are busy, right?


871
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,816
And sometimes, you know, it's
just hard to get together.


872
00:44:24,726 --> 00:44:27,566
And so we wanted a
way to go faster.


873
00:44:28,306 --> 00:44:29,686
Can we go faster?


874
00:44:29,686 --> 00:44:31,966
And so one of my very,
very smart friends, again,


875
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:34,226
smart friends, it's a real key,


876
00:44:34,226 --> 00:44:35,856
one of my very smartest
friends came


877
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:37,766
up with this idea of settings.


878
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:39,496
And what are settings?


879
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:42,226
Well, settings are
tunable values, right?


880
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:45,526
You take all of the settings
that you might want to tune


881
00:44:45,876 --> 00:44:48,226
and put them in just an object


882
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:50,106
that just is a bag
of properties.


883
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:53,276
You use KVO, so that
when you change one


884
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:56,966
of those properties the parts of
the system that are interested


885
00:44:56,966 --> 00:45:00,626
in those values changing
can know about it.


886
00:45:00,886 --> 00:45:02,266
She also came up
with this way to save


887
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:06,036
and restore these options,
and then there was also a way


888
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,016
that you could have
settings, which own settings,


889
00:45:08,016 --> 00:45:10,766
which own settings, so you
could have a tree of settings.


890
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:12,426
And also came up
with an editing UI,


891
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:14,226
and it's the editing
UI I want to show you.


892
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:16,866
So here's just a very simple
example, a very simple app


893
00:45:17,536 --> 00:45:19,966
that lets you manipulate
geometric shapes.


894
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:23,076
So I've got now one blue
circle, and you can go


895
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:27,556
and with the settings UI you
can then bring up a hud right


896
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:31,936
in the app, twiddle a
couple of sliders and change


897
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:35,866
from one blue triangle to
three red triangles, great.


898
00:45:37,106 --> 00:45:39,006
And then similarly we
can go to this other one


899
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:41,446
that actually support
those nested settings,


900
00:45:41,446 --> 00:45:44,726
that would use sort of iPhone
style, side-to-side navigation


901
00:45:44,726 --> 00:45:46,626
to show you the different
levels of settings.


902
00:45:46,906 --> 00:45:49,086
And so if I take the red
triangles and move it back


903
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:52,146
to the settings for the
blue circle, you have this.


904
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:53,416
And so what did this do?


905
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,806
This did something
very important.


906
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:56,816
This reduced iteration time


907
00:45:56,816 --> 00:46:01,046
because once you had the right
settings surfaced in the app,


908
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:03,476
you could sit with the
designer, an engineer could sit


909
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:06,946
with the designer, and try
many, many, many options.


910
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:10,886
And so we got to the point where
you kind of tried to figure


911
00:46:10,886 --> 00:46:12,326
out what control
center could look like,


912
00:46:12,326 --> 00:46:13,556
and the designer
could say, well,


913
00:46:13,556 --> 00:46:15,146
what if we made it
2 percent darker?


914
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:18,636
I don't even know if you can
see that up on the big screen?


915
00:46:18,636 --> 00:46:22,316
It's the point of it, is that
we were trying to get tuning


916
00:46:22,806 --> 00:46:26,356
to this level, 2 percent
darker, 2 percent darker


917
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,046
on your left than on your right.


918
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:34,066
We wanted that level
of polish and attention


919
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:37,416
to every single value in the OS.


920
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:40,476
So when we had a tuning
session like this, it was great


921
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:45,236
because I could just go back to
my desk now, copy the defaults


922
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,516
that got saved from
the tuning session,


923
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,266
copy those to the new
defaults, and commit.


924
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:54,696
It's great, and this made
it cheap and easy to tune;


925
00:46:54,696 --> 00:46:57,626
we could just do it over and
over and over and over again.


926
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:01,966
And this was the way that we
wound up with just a handful


927
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,476
of blur styles for iOS 7


928
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:04,946
that are used consistently
everywhere.


929
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:08,086
It was very, very difficult
to come up with those,


930
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:09,476
with that set of blur styles.


931
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,496
And this is how we did it by
just iterating and iterating


932
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,226
and making iterating
easy and cheap.


933
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:16,926
The lesson really, right,


934
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:19,436
is iterating quickly
leads to better work.


935
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:24,106
I think my experience from
iOS 7 was there was a direct


936
00:47:24,106 --> 00:47:29,306
correlation between how easy we
made it to try out new things


937
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:32,586
and what the quality of
the final work product was.


938
00:47:36,996 --> 00:47:39,306
And so that's "Let's
Try 2% Darker,"


939
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:48,506
and the lesson is iterating
quickly leads to better work.


940
00:47:48,506 --> 00:47:50,616
Okay, story number eight.


941
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:54,876
Three lessons from
making this session.


942
00:47:55,156 --> 00:47:59,486
And so this is not
the original session.


943
00:48:00,196 --> 00:48:02,826
I wrote an entirely
different set of slides.


944
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:05,526
And not only that.


945
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:07,506
I did three full
rehearsals with them.


946
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:10,006
I like to rehearse a lot
before, I mean it's important


947
00:48:10,036 --> 00:48:12,186
that this session
goes well for you all.


948
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:13,626
You all came here, and I want


949
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,206
to make sure they're
giving you a good product,


950
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:17,356
I mean so I put a
tremendous amount of effort


951
00:48:17,356 --> 00:48:19,036
into preparing the
slides and rehearsing.


952
00:48:19,636 --> 00:48:23,386
And so with that other set of
slides I used up a big portion


953
00:48:23,386 --> 00:48:26,116
of my time rehearsing
that set of slides.


954
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:30,506
See, the good thing was, it
was done way ahead of time.


955
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:31,686
It was great.


956
00:48:31,686 --> 00:48:33,696
It felt good to just
be like preparing


957
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:36,386
for WWDC can be really,
boy, it just always seems


958
00:48:36,386 --> 00:48:39,026
like everything is down to
the wire, and this year, boy,


959
00:48:39,026 --> 00:48:40,416
I was really ahead of time.


960
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:42,986
But I had one more review
for the content that I had


961
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:45,476
in my slides, just go over
the material and the content,


962
00:48:45,476 --> 00:48:48,946
particularly because I'm talking
about some past Apple work.


963
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:51,566
And it turns out, yeah, that
version just got shot down.


964
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:52,946
Yeah, you can't show that.


965
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,516
There were just issues
that couldn't be resolved.


966
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,916
The details aren't
important, but there's kind


967
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:01,556
of the one big detail which is
I don't have a session anymore.


968
00:49:03,436 --> 00:49:06,286
Three weeks ago I had
something that was rehearsed,


969
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:12,566
and two weeks ago I didn't know
if I was going to be here today.


970
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:15,336
So I needed to rewrite.


971
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:17,326
And there were three
important lessons


972
00:49:17,326 --> 00:49:19,156
that I took away from that.


973
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:25,536
And the first was during this
review session, where the person


974
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,526
who I was submitting my
slides for review to,


975
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,346
said "You can't show that."


976
00:49:32,656 --> 00:49:35,926
He didn't raise his voice, it's
just like "You can't show that."


977
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:41,766
And here's why, he gave me the
reasons, but he was very calm.


978
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:47,476
And even after, I mean it was
clear, it was bad news to me,


979
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:51,236
and even he found me later
and made sure that I was okay


980
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:54,776
with this decision that was a
very hard one to share with me.


981
00:49:55,886 --> 00:50:00,706
And so the lesson from this is
be kind to people, but be honest


982
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,046
about the work, right?


983
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:07,876
There's no reason to like be
shouting and berating people


984
00:50:07,876 --> 00:50:10,276
who are trying hard
and doing their best.


985
00:50:10,596 --> 00:50:13,566
If you have ever found
me in a lab or maybe even


986
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:15,086
with what little
time we have left


987
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:17,356
in the conference before
it ends, if you find me


988
00:50:17,356 --> 00:50:22,236
in a lab today, I hope I
will do my utmost to be kind


989
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:25,496
to you personally because
I'm so glad that you're here


990
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:27,286
and so glad you're
contributing to our platform.


991
00:50:27,976 --> 00:50:29,886
And I want to see you
do great work, too.


992
00:50:29,886 --> 00:50:32,876
But if you show me a piece of
work, I'm going to be honest


993
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,906
on what I think about it.


994
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,956
And those things just
need to be kept separate,


995
00:50:37,106 --> 00:50:39,906
the personal kindness and
the honesty about the work.


996
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:46,966
And, secondly, it's kind of
like sort of this different side


997
00:50:46,966 --> 00:50:47,866
of the same coin, is


998
00:50:47,866 --> 00:50:50,506
that I didn't take his
feedback personally.


999
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:56,986
And the lesson is to separate
yourself from your work.


1000
00:50:57,826 --> 00:51:03,576
Now and I always invest a
tremendous amount of care


1001
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:08,536
and emotion into my work, it's
my nature, I can't help it.


1002
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:12,716
But after I'm done making
something and bring it


1003
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:15,446
to the stage that
it's ready to demo,


1004
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:20,226
I just try to then divorce
myself from that thing


1005
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:27,126
that I just sweated over
making because that's not me,


1006
00:51:27,406 --> 00:51:29,516
that thing that I
just made, all right?


1007
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:34,326
I'm ready to accept whatever
feedback anybody has and ready


1008
00:51:34,326 --> 00:51:36,266
to go and do the
next thing, right?


1009
00:51:37,186 --> 00:51:40,886
So you need to kind of divorce
yourself, when you get feedback,


1010
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:44,026
people hopefully are not
giving you the feedback,


1011
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:46,516
they're giving you the
feedback about the work.


1012
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:49,026
So separate yourself
from the work,


1013
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:50,956
regardless of how
much time and effort


1014
00:51:51,296 --> 00:51:54,656
and how much investment
you have in it.


1015
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:58,646
And the third lesson
is, well, obviously,


1016
00:51:58,646 --> 00:51:59,856
I needed to get back to work.


1017
00:51:59,856 --> 00:52:03,866
If I wanted to have a
show, right, at all,


1018
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:08,076
I needed to figure
out how to make a set


1019
00:52:08,076 --> 00:52:09,086
of slides that would work.


1020
00:52:10,046 --> 00:52:11,716
And the lesson here is
that you're never done.


1021
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:17,656
Kind of seems like some sort
of nightmare, if you think


1022
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:20,246
about it one way it's that
you're never done, really?


1023
00:52:20,636 --> 00:52:22,406
But you think about it,
no, we're never done.


1024
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:28,446
We loved the first version of
the iPhone when we shipped it,


1025
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:31,636
and then we went right back
and we made version two.


1026
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:34,786
And earlier this week we
showed iOS 8 and Yosemite


1027
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:37,046
and a whole bunch of
other great things, right?


1028
00:52:37,046 --> 00:52:38,246
You are never done.


1029
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:41,686
If you're committed to
working in this industry,


1030
00:52:41,686 --> 00:52:44,296
working in high tech,
right, you are never done.


1031
00:52:44,296 --> 00:52:46,216
The world keeps moving;
you've got to try


1032
00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:47,156
to keep moving with it.


1033
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,936
So do the best that you
can do at any one time.


1034
00:52:49,936 --> 00:52:52,036
And basically you're always
shipping your latest demo,


1035
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:54,476
if you think about it that way,
it's just that these demos get


1036
00:52:54,476 --> 00:52:56,546
to be very, very polished,
polished to the point


1037
00:52:56,546 --> 00:52:58,546
where you're going
to actually share it


1038
00:52:58,546 --> 00:53:00,606
with the rest of
the world, right?


1039
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:07,526
So still on this idea, this
is a quotation that's actually


1040
00:53:07,766 --> 00:53:10,706
up on the wall -
very, very large.


1041
00:53:10,706 --> 00:53:14,996
In Cupertino, a quote from
Steve Jobs, and he said,


1042
00:53:14,996 --> 00:53:16,906
"If you do something and
turns out pretty good,


1043
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,916
then you should go do
something else wonderful,


1044
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:22,956
not dwell on it too long,
just figure out what's next."


1045
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:26,876
And I think this is true, not
only when you do something


1046
00:53:26,876 --> 00:53:30,276
that turns out well, but it's
even as in the case for me,


1047
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:32,196
for this session, I did
something that didn't turn


1048
00:53:32,196 --> 00:53:35,016
out so well, I needed to
figure out what was next.


1049
00:53:35,986 --> 00:53:39,166
I could give up, or I could
try again, and I tried again,


1050
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:40,326
and I'm very glad that I did.


1051
00:53:40,326 --> 00:53:41,526
I'm very happy to be here today.


1052
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:46,876
And so the kind of the big,
sort of joined up lesson


1053
00:53:46,876 --> 00:53:51,066
from this section is that the
stories and lessons never end.


1054
00:53:51,066 --> 00:53:53,396
I thought this was going to be
a session just about stories


1055
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,606
and lessons and had no idea
that I had started a process


1056
00:53:56,606 --> 00:53:58,156
that would teach
me more lessons.


1057
00:53:58,956 --> 00:54:06,276
And so those are my
stories, and there they are.


1058
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:11,576
Again, and I think, I hope,


1059
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:15,386
at least that you found
them entertaining,


1060
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:21,716
but really I think the important
part is these, the lessons,


1061
00:54:21,936 --> 00:54:24,196
that you can take out from
them, because you're never going


1062
00:54:24,196 --> 00:54:28,966
to find yourself in exactly
the same situations that I did.


1063
00:54:29,896 --> 00:54:32,506
But I think that you'll
find yourself in situations


1064
00:54:32,506 --> 00:54:34,296
where you can apply some


1065
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:37,326
of these ideas usefully
and productively.


1066
00:54:38,386 --> 00:54:40,656
So, again, those are my stories.


1067
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:45,026
And so now I ask you,
I urge you, to go out


1068
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:47,716
and make your own stories,
tell your own stories,


1069
00:54:48,496 --> 00:54:50,766
extract the lessons
out from them, right?


1070
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:54,676
And then figure out how you're
going to use that experience


1071
00:54:55,136 --> 00:54:57,536
to go and do some more
great work of your own.


1072
00:54:58,046 --> 00:54:58,736
So thank you very much.


1073
00:54:59,516 --> 00:55:07,220
