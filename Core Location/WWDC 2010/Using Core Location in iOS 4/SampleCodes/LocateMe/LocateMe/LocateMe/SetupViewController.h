Abstract:

Displayed by either a GetLocationViewController or a TrackLocationViewController, this view controller is presented modally and communicates back to the presenting controller using a simple delegate protocol. The protocol sends setupViewController:didFinishSetupWithInfo: to its delegate with a dictionary containing a desired accuracy and either a timeout or a distance filter value. A custom UIPickerView specifies the desired accuracy. A slider is shown for setting the timeout or distance filter. This view controller can be initialized using either of two nib files: GetLocationSetupView.xib or TrackLocationSetupView.xib. These nibs have nearly identical layouts, but differ in the labels and attributes for the slider.
