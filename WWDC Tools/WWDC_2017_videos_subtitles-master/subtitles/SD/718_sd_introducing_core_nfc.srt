00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:17,146
[ Background Conversations ]


2
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:18,116
>> Welcome.


3
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,796
This year, we are delighted to


4
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,896
introduce a new framework in iOS


5
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:25,756
11 called Core NFC, that would


6
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:27,946
allow your apps to integrate NFC


7
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,466
on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.


8
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:34,126
Using Core NFC, apps can


9
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,486
interact with their physical


10
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,076
environment and the real-world


11
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:38,046
objects within it.


12
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,056
You may already know that Apple


13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,736
Pay uses NFC for complex


14
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:44,376
payment.


15
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,966
Now, with the introduction of


16
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,656
Core NFC, you will be able to


17
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:52,716
use NFC in your applications to


18
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:54,576
create new and innovative user


19
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:58,676
experiences with the iPhone.


20
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:00,686
In this session, we will give


21
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,436
you a brief overview of new


22
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,476
field communications, what is


23
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:06,576
supported in the Core NFC


24
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,916
framework, the requirements and


25
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,236
details for using it, and some


26
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:12,096
example code.


27
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:16,056
To start off, let's talk a


28
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:17,616
little bit about Near Field


29
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:18,346
Communication.


30
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,736
Near Field Communication, known


31
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:25,686
simply as NFC, is a wireless


32
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,126
technology that allows the


33
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,926
exchange of information between


34
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:30,576
devices that are within close


35
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:31,276
proximity.


36
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:33,986
Limited to a range of just a few


37
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:34,796
centimeters.


38
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:38,366
NFC is actually a collection of


39
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,936
a number of different standards


40
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:40,846
and protocols.


41
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:43,696
All of these standards coexist


42
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,066
and are used in different


43
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:45,896
applications.


44
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,316
You may have seen or had


45
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,156
experience with NFC text.


46
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,926
The small little stickers or


47
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:53,706
cards which can be read


48
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,066
wirelessly by an NFC reader.


49
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,396
NFC text comes in a wide variety


50
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:01,326
of shapes, sizes, and


51
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:02,056
capacities.


52
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,496
They are classified into five


53
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,286
categories, known as Type 1


54
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:07,306
through Type 5.


55
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:09,636
Each one corresponding to a


56
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:10,466
different standard.


57
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,896
For example, Type 3 texts are


58
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:14,956
based on FEDECA [assumed


59
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:17,256
spelling] and Type 4 is based on


60
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:21,486
ISO-14443.


61
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:23,856
The NFC Forum has defined the


62
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:26,576
NFC Data Exchange Format, or


63
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,726
NDEF for short, as a common


64
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:30,526
messaging format for exchanging


65
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,646
data in a standardized way among


66
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,356
the different text types.


67
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,036
Now that we have covered some


68
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:40,586
NFC basics, let's take a look at


69
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:43,086
what you can do with Core NFC.


70
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:47,016
For the initial launch of Core


71
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,626
NFC, we have focused on NFC Tag


72
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,146
Reading, which can be used to


73
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:52,886
enhance the user experience in a


74
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,516
wide variety of ways.


75
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:57,516
Potential applications include


76
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,606
connecting user to location or


77
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:03,586
context-specific content,


78
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,026
connecting physical hardware


79
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:09,086
with your application, and even


80
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,666
for in-store product information


81
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,886
or inventory tracking.


82
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,306
In addition, NFC Tags can be


83
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,206
used in place of QR codes.


84
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:21,876
Core NFC will allow your


85
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,686
application to read any NDEF


86
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,626
formatted tag.


87
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,066
This greatly simplifies the


88
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,586
process of reading tags within


89
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,056
your application or for having


90
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:31,196
to deal with the different


91
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:31,936
standards.


92
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,366
Tag reading is supported on


93
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,416
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.


94
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,806
At this time, Core NFC does not


95
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:41,576
support writing or formatting


96
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:42,406
operations.


97
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:46,886
There are two requirements for


98
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:48,386
using Core NFC in your


99
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:49,616
application.


100
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,816
First, Core NFC is an


101
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,966
entitlement-protective


102
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:55,486
framework.


103
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,216
You will need to turn on the


104
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,116
Near Field Communication Tag


105
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,406
Reading Capability from Xcode to


106
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,476
get this entitlement.


107
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,856
However, this capability would


108
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,426
not be in Xcode for the first


109
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,216
[inaudible] released at WWDC.


110
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,966
In the meantime, you can


111
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,326
manually request this


112
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,756
entitlement by visiting the


113
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:17,016
Certificates, Identifiers and


114
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:19,185
Profiles page on the Apple


115
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:20,196
Developer website.


116
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,796
The second requirement for Core


117
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:28,056
NFC is a Scan Usage Description.


118
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,976
This string is required in your


119
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:33,016
application's info P-list file,


120
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:34,786
and it will be displayed to the


121
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,126
user when your application


122
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:38,426
starts NFC scanning.


123
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,716
For more information, you can


124
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,986
watch the WWDC session, Privacy


125
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:44,956
and Your Apps.


126
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:49,656
Now that you have configured


127
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,666
your project correctly, let's


128
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,066
review some additional details


129
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,846
about tag reading with the Core


130
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:55,706
NFC framework.


131
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:00,856
First, tag reading is an


132
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,916
on-demand process, meaning that


133
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,656
your application has to initiate


134
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:06,496
a tag reading activity using a


135
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:06,986
session.


136
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,086
Second, your application has to


137
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:12,906
be visible and foregrounded in


138
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:14,436
order to start a tag reading


139
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:14,996
activity.


140
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,096
A tag reading session will be


141
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,596
ended if your application is


142
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:20,146
backgrounded or ceases to be


143
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:20,566
visible.


144
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:24,596
Next, each tag reading activity


145
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,326
is limited to 60 seconds at a


146
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:26,746
time.


147
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,956
If a session has timed out or


148
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:30,586
invalidated, your application


149
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,936
must create a new session to


150
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,646
initiate another tag reading


151
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:34,206
activity.


152
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:38,246
You can configure a session to


153
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,096
read either a single tag or


154
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:41,126
multiple tags.


155
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,596
In a single tag reading mode,


156
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,516
the session will be ended


157
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,316
automatically after a tag is


158
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:47,676
read.


159
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:50,296
On the other hand, a multi-tag


160
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,636
reading session will remain


161
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,096
active until canceled by the


162
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,966
user, or the 60-second timeout


163
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:55,606
is reached.


164
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:00,156
Finally, as mentioned


165
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:02,996
previously, the NFC Usage String


166
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:06,136
defined in your info P-list will


167
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,706
be displayed to the user while


168
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:09,166
the tag reading activity is in


169
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:09,746
progress.


170
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:13,926
We have provided a sample


171
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,126
application along with this


172
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,436
presentation to demonstrate the


173
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:19,126
use of Core NFC.


174
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,396
Consider the case where you want


175
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,566
to take a physical kind of


176
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,266
inventory.


177
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,666
Here, we are showing you the key


178
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,446
user interaction sequence of the


179
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:27,466
sample application.


180
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:29,936
The sample application consists


181
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,806
of a main table view, and a Scan


182
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:32,266
button.


183
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,686
Every time an inventory item is


184
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,486
scanned, it is displayed as a


185
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,086
role entry in this main table


186
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:38,416
view.


187
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,906
Just click on the Scan button to


188
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:44,876
start a tag scanning.


189
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,816
This UI will be presented to the


190
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,836
user hopefully on top of your


191
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,836
application once tag scanning


192
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:51,476
has begun.


193
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:54,406
During tag scanning, the user's


194
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:56,076
description string is displayed


195
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:56,986
within the UI.


196
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,496
At any time, the user can hit


197
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:01,106
the Cancel button to stop a tag


198
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,146
scanning, which will invalidate


199
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:03,886
the reader session.


200
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:09,106
The UI will get updated once an


201
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,116
NFC tag has been successfully


202
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:11,476
read.


203
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,196
Here, we have configured our


204
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:15,916
reader session to be single tag


205
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,516
read mode.


206
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:22,026
Finally, the overlaid UI will be


207
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,526
dismissed, and the application


208
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,136
will be foregrounded once the


209
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:26,886
tag reading session has ended.


210
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:30,966
All right.


211
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:32,136
Let's walk through the code


212
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:33,146
together from the sample


213
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,536
application we have just shown.


214
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:38,336
At a high level, you would need


215
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:39,766
to perform these three easy


216
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,916
steps to enable tag reading in


217
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,676
your application.


218
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:47,326
First, adopt the NFC NDEF Reader


219
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:48,836
Session Delegate Protocol.


220
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,596
Next, create an instance of the


221
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,626
NFC NDEF Reader Session Class,


222
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,546
and provide it with your


223
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:57,066
delegate.


224
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,086
Finally, start a reader session


225
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,506
using the Begin method, and


226
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,116
handle the delegate callbacks.


227
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:09,156
Here is a cool snippet from the


228
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,676
sample application, illustrating


229
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:11,836
the three-step approach.


230
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,846
To start off, we import the Core


231
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,986
NFC framework into the code.


232
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,386
Here we adopt the delegate


233
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:23,706
protocol in Table View


234
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:25,016
Controller, which will handle


235
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:26,716
the two required callbacks.


236
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:30,996
They invalidate with error and


237
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,236
detect NDEF.


238
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:38,385
The invalidate with error


239
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,986
callback will notify your


240
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,486
application when a tag reading


241
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:42,616
activity has stopped.


242
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,746
This can happen for a variety of


243
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:46,326
reasons.


244
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,556
For example, a tag has been


245
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:50,246
successfully read in a single


246
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,116
tag read session.


247
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:53,536
The user has chosen to stop the


248
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:54,696
tag scanning activity.


249
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,716
The 3-second timeout has expired


250
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,056
or the application is no longer


251
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:00,756
in the foreground.


252
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,766
The specific session object


253
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,186
provided in the first parameter


254
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,896
will be invalidated after the


255
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:07,926
function exits.


256
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:10,276
A new reader session instance is


257
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:12,146
required for additional tag


258
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:12,446
reading.


259
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:17,166
The detect NDEFs will be invoked


260
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,136
every time an NDEF has been read


261
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:20,226
from an NFC tag.


262
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,816
Your application can then grab


263
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:23,946
the payload from the NDEF


264
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:26,706
message, decode it, and handle


265
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:27,996
the message as appropriate.


266
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,846
Finally, we have an extra method


267
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:35,236
that links to the Scan button


268
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:36,736
for starting a single tag read


269
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:37,226
session.


270
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,196
All you need to do is create an


271
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,136
instance of NFC NDEF Reader


272
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,786
Session with your data gate,


273
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,636
then invoke to begin method to


274
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:46,776
start tag scanning.


275
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,926
If you wish to create a


276
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,326
multi-tag reading session, set


277
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:53,126
the invalidate at the first read


278
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:54,316
parameter to False.


279
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,606
If you need to stop an ongoing


280
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:58,296
session programmatically, you


281
00:09:58,296 --> 00:09:59,886
can call the invalidate method.


282
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,116
This will trigger your


283
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,096
invalidate with error callback,


284
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:05,476
letting you know that the


285
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:06,396
session has ended.


286
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,386
In summary, it is very simple to


287
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,276
enable NFC tag reading with Core


288
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,766
NFC by following these steps.


289
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,116
Enable the NFC tag reading


290
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:22,846
capability.


291
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:26,676
Make sure your Scan Usage


292
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,336
Description String is set in


293
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,426
your info P-list.


294
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,906
Integrate the Core NFC framework


295
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:34,566
in your code.


296
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,776
And start reading tags.
