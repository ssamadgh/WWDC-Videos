HeaderFooter

Demonstrates how to implement and customize the 2 UIView properties of UITableView:
    header ('tableHeaderView') and footer ('tableFooterView').
It is designed to somewhat resemble the "Contacts" application, showing you ways to design your own header and footer content. It uses the UITableViewStyle: UITableViewStyleGrouped to achieve a more similar appearance as well.

This sample implements two basic UIViews from a nib file: one for the header and one for the footer. Each as IBOutlets are set as header and footer properties of the UITableView. Additional code is provided to illustrate how to set their transparent background colors, but the same work that can also be done in the UIView's xib.
