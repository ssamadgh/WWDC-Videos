1
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:21,696
Subscriptions are the fastest

2
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:22,876
growing business model in the

3
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:23,426
App Store.

4
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:25,366
Why is it almost every time

5
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,846
you're ready to sign up for an

6
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:29,726
awesome new service or to

7
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:31,436
subscribe to some amazing new

8
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:33,926
content, this is the feeling

9
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:34,486
that you get?

10
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:36,736
That's because it's all too

11
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,796
common for subscriptions to feel

12
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:42,156
complicated, confusing, or just

13
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:44,386
take too long to sign up.

14
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:46,426
So, for a great user experience,

15
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:47,866
make your subscription

16
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:50,446
effortless, transparent, and

17
00:00:50,446 --> 00:00:51,006
engaging.

18
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:52,926
Let's focus on each of these

19
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:54,396
principles to improve the user

20
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:55,876
experience and design for

21
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:56,826
subscription success.

22
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:00,816
The first step we'll talk about,

23
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,316
being effortless.

24
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,246
So what does it mean for your

25
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:05,556
subscription to be effortless?

26
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:07,546
It means that people should know

27
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:08,956
that you have a subscription.

28
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:11,336
That way they shouldn't have to

29
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:14,006
look for how to sign up.

30
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:16,166
So it's important to be visible.

31
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,356
Get out there and don't be shy.

32
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,206
Let people know that you have a

33
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,026
subscription offer, and ask them

34
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:23,316
to sign up.

35
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:25,296
One approach would be to persist

36
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:26,916
a Subscribe button in your app's

37
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,486
interface.

38
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,876
Here in "The New York Times"

39
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,966
they do a great job persisting a

40
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:32,876
Subscribe button.

41
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:34,846
And they do this tastefully

42
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:35,876
throughout the entire UI.

43
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,856
It's very visible.

44
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,616
And it's across each article.

45
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:41,976
This is done really well.

46
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:44,506
And it's not annoying or pushy,

47
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,416
because it families together

48
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,326
with their interface.

49
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,416
Don't present your subscription

50
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,846
like a popup add or a

51
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:52,706
notification.

52
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,376
Because popups and notifications

53
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,026
are intended to be dismissed.

54
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,616
And you don't want people to

55
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,116
dismiss your subscription offer.

56
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:02,386
Another way to present your

57
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:04,086
subscription would be to be

58
00:02:04,086 --> 00:02:05,736
visible and present it when

59
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,396
someone has expressed interest

60
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,606
in a piece of content or in a

61
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,016
feature that you offer through a

62
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,146
subscription.

63
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:15,246
This is the dating app Her.

64
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,406
So let's just say you're swiping

65
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,626
through a few profiles and you

66
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:20,896
accidentally pass on somebody

67
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:21,386
who's cute.

68
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,276
So you attempt to rewind that

69
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,456
profile, and in that moment, the

70
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:27,626
app Her tastefully presents an

71
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:28,936
option for you to subscribe.

72
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:31,086
Because the rewind feature is

73
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:32,016
what they offer as a

74
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:32,756
subscription.

75
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:34,806
And this is great.

76
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,206
It's an appropriate time for Her

77
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:37,526
to present you with this offer

78
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:38,926
because you've shown interest.

79
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:41,196
Her does a wonderful job

80
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:42,376
presenting the values of your

81
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:44,276
subscription right here as well

82
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:46,206
with this beautiful, light

83
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:46,836
animation.

84
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:50,876
So whether you choose to make it

85
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,096
persistent in your user

86
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:55,266
interface, or present the option

87
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,066
to subscribe when someone has

88
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:59,586
expressed interest, make sure

89
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:01,276
that it is visible to people so

90
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:02,036
they know you have a

91
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,116
subscription.

92
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:05,636
And no matter what you choose,

93
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:07,686
all subscription apps should

94
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,536
include a place to sign up in

95
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,626
Settings or Accounts, because

96
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,446
it's a very intuitive place for

97
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:14,646
place for people to look to sign

98
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:14,883
up.

99
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:17,376
All right.

100
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:19,566
Also, to make your subscription

101
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:21,536
effortless, you need to remove

102
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,286
friction.

103
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:25,086
Friction is asking for too much

104
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:27,316
information, having too many

105
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:29,516
steps, and taking too much time

106
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:30,496
for somebody to sign up.

107
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,496
But how do you know when you've

108
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,576
asked for too much?

109
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:35,716
This data should help.

110
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:38,386
This graph represents a snapshot

111
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,196
of one month of data from the

112
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:42,406
three top video streaming apps

113
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,666
in the US.

114
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:45,296
Now, while their names have been

115
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:47,486
removed, all the important data

116
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:48,846
here is the clicks to conversion

117
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:49,446
ratio.

118
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,155
A subscription flow that has

119
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:55,856
three clicks led to a 61%

120
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:56,616
conversion rate.

121
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:58,456
And a subscription flow with

122
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:00,976
four clicks led to a 48%

123
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:01,676
conversion rate.

124
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:03,836
However, as soon as there was

125
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,106
nine clicks, it dropped

126
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,246
significantly down to 7%.

127
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,096
Now, while this is just a

128
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:10,976
sample, it's clear that you

129
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:12,316
should only ask for what is

130
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,166
absolutely necessary for someone

131
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:14,786
to sign up.

132
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:17,996
Because quite literally, less is

133
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:18,386
more.

134
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,756
Less clicks, less friction, will

135
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,736
lead to more conversion and more

136
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:24,466
subscribers.

137
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,136
So focus on people on just

138
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,186
signing up first.

139
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,246
Things like favoriting,

140
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:32,276
personalization, and asking for

141
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:33,656
additional personal details can

142
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:35,476
all wait until after someone has

143
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,566
signed up.

144
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:39,156
So, by being visible, and

145
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,386
removing friction, your app

146
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:42,756
subscription will be effortless

147
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:44,126
and easier for people to

148
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:44,646
subscribe.

149
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,546
Next, let's talk about being

150
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,536
transparent with your

151
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:50,406
subscription.

152
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:52,976
Because transparency is the best

153
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:53,546
policy.

154
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,756
And you need to provide clear

155
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:58,256
terms so people understand what

156
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,306
they're signing up for.

157
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,096
Strive to be glance-able.

158
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,486
All in one view and in just a

159
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:06,156
few seconds, people should be

160
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:07,966
able to clearly understand what

161
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,716
your subscription offer is and

162
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,506
how to sign up.

163
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:12,366
So when you're making your

164
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:15,276
subscription, always include: a

165
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:17,966
concise value proposition, a

166
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,096
strong call to action, a place

167
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:22,826
for people to log in if they are

168
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,036
existing subscribers.

169
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,036
Also the ability to restore if

170
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,076
someone has a new device.

171
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,066
And a place to sign up that

172
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,116
includes clear pricing and

173
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:33,616
terms.

174
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,306
And always offer multiple tiers.

175
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:37,856
Because you don't know if

176
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,286
somebody wants to sign up for a

177
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:42,026
day, a week, a month, or two

178
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:42,476
years.

179
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:44,996
So try offering three or four

180
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,056
different tiers to find out what

181
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,756
works best for your audience.

182
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,386
The MLB At Bat app does a great

183
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,406
job and offers all of this in

184
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:56,086
one easy-to-understand

185
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,286
glance-able view.

186
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,866
And this is important because

187
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,616
most of us are signing up on our

188
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,066
phones.

189
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,926
So please, keep it simple.

190
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:07,726
By providing clear terms, people

191
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:09,086
will be able to make an informed

192
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:10,846
decision on how to subscribe.

193
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:12,326
All right.

194
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,446
I saved the best for last.

195
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,716
Your app needs to be engaging

196
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:20,186
from the start, before people

197
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:20,796
subscribe.

198
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,846
And the best way to engage them

199
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:24,286
is through experience.

200
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:27,176
Let them experience your app and

201
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:29,016
your app's content before having

202
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:29,856
them subscribe.

203
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,186
Because being able to experience

204
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,056
and try before you buy is a part

205
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,086
of how we make purchase

206
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:35,746
decisions today.

207
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,296
From trying on clothes to

208
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:42,096
attending an open house, or even

209
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,446
test driving a car before you

210
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,556
buy or lease it.

211
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,426
All of these are experiences

212
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:48,856
that you can do that help you

213
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:50,116
make a decision before you

214
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:50,486
purchase.

215
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,336
And the same applies for your

216
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:53,446
app.

217
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,156
There are three ways to engage

218
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,286
people through experience.

219
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,906
And it'll make it much easier

220
00:06:58,906 --> 00:06:59,936
for them to subscribe.

221
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,916
First, you can offer a free

222
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,426
trial.

223
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,416
That way, people can try out the

224
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,396
entire app for free for a

225
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:08,156
limited time.

226
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,406
This works well for established

227
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:12,786
brands and when people have an

228
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:14,556
idea of what's included with the

229
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:15,296
subscription.

230
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,676
So, if you have an established

231
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,606
brand, a free trial is a great

232
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,166
way to let people engage with

233
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,586
your app and its contents before

234
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:24,256
they subscribe.

235
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:27,506
You can also make the majority

236
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,286
of your app available for free

237
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:31,426
and offer a premium feature as a

238
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:32,166
subscription.

239
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,456
For example, in the app Sleep

240
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:36,496
Cycle, you can use the entire

241
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,836
app for free, except the trends

242
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:41,426
feature shown here is what is

243
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,416
available to people who have

244
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,006
subscribed.

245
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,816
And Sleep Cycle makes it really

246
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,256
easy for people to sign up right

247
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:48,716
from here.

248
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:50,946
It's a great technique to offer

249
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:52,696
a peek of content behind this

250
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:53,166
blur.

251
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,866
That way potential subscribers

252
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,486
can see what kind of content

253
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:59,206
they would have access to if

254
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:00,316
they did subscribe.

255
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,126
And finally, you can allow

256
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,486
people to sample content.

257
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:07,336
It's a great way to engage

258
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,146
through experience.

259
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:09,476
And it works great for the

260
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:10,626
majority of apps.

261
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,535
This is "The New York Times."

262
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:14,886
And you're able to read ten

263
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,136
articles for free per month.

264
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:19,256
And this is a wonderful sampling

265
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:21,116
experience because "The New York

266
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,176
Times" lets people have control

267
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,786
over what content they're able

268
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,426
to sample.

269
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:27,706
That allows people to find the

270
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:28,876
content that they're interested

271
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,376
in and helps them better

272
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,866
understand the value of the

273
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:32,596
subscription.

274
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,676
The objective is to let people

275
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,586
experience and become familiar

276
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,236
with your app and its content.

277
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,206
And that will make it easier for

278
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,026
them to subscribe.

279
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:44,616
And no matter which option you

280
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:46,636
choose, make sure that it works

281
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,876
for your audience.

282
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,716
And you know them best.

283
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:51,566
Think about their current user

284
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,556
experience, the type of content

285
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:54,966
they have currently available in

286
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:56,766
your app, and how adding

287
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,116
subscriptions could impact that

288
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:58,766
experience.

289
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:01,726
So design your subscription to

290
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:03,706
be effortless by being visible

291
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,226
and reducing friction.

292
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:07,276
By being transparent with your

293
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,606
terms and pricing, and engaging

294
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:11,586
people through experiencing your

295
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:13,326
app and its rich contents.

296
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,146
That way it'll be really easy

297
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:17,926
for people to sign up.

298
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:18,356
Thank you.
