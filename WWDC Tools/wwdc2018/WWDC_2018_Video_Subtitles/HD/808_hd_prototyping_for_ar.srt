00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:21,456
>> Thanks, Mike.


4
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:23,536
Hey everyone.


5
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:25,916
How many of you're interested in


6
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:26,156
AR?


7
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:28,106
All right.


8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,326
Cool. Now how many of you have


9
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:31,606
an AR app in the App Store


10
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:31,936
already?


11
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:34,876
Okay. A few less.


12
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:37,726
I get it. AR can be pretty


13
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:38,276
intimidating.


14
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:40,716
Well, today we're going to look


15
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:42,466
at a few techniques that we use


16
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:44,516
which will hopefully help you in


17
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:45,006
two ways.


18
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,246
First, they're going to


19
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,886
hopefully help make AR more


20
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:52,346
approachable and second, we're


21
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:53,256
going to show you how you can


22
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:55,106
save time and money by making


23
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,246
sure you build the right things


24
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,386
before you write a single line


25
00:00:58,496 --> 00:00:59,306
of code.


26
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:01,296
So let's get started.


27
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,186
If you've seen previous talks by


28
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,766
my team here at WWDC, you may


29
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:08,896
already be familiar with our


30
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:11,726
revolutionary app Toast Modern,


31
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:14,626
the best app for finding and


32
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,096
rating the toast around you.


33
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:17,516
I know it's amazing.


34
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:20,436
Well, we've been building up our


35
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:22,976
database of toast, and now we've


36
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:24,836
been tasked with adding AR to


37
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:26,826
this app.


38
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,206
I'm sure you're all aware that


39
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:29,586
the artisanal toast scene in the


40
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:31,146
Bay Area it's pretty big right


41
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:31,416
now.


42
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:35,666
Well, today it's going to get a


43
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:36,846
whole lot bigger.


44
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:42,196
Introducing ToastAR, the world's


45
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:46,036
first AR toast recognition and


46
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:46,896
rating app.


47
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:48,346
I know. Thank you.


48
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:48,926
Thank you.


49
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,776
Through the use of computer


50
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:55,076
vision and AR, ToastAR lets you


51
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,556
check the ratings on a piece of


52
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,686
toast and get this, where it's


53
00:01:58,686 --> 00:01:59,026
from.


54
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,106
Revolutionary I know.


55
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,136
I mean, you're all developers


56
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,296
for Apple platforms so you


57
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,716
expect the best APIs and the


58
00:02:06,716 --> 00:02:07,926
best hardware.


59
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:09,726
Why not also expect only the


60
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:10,606
best toast too.


61
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,246
So how did we prototype this


62
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:14,996
beautiful, revolutionary app?


63
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,276
Well, you may think we used a


64
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:20,426
programming language like Swift


65
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:24,786
or a framework like ARKit or


66
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:26,376
maybe even a sophisticated


67
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:27,736
application such as Unity.


68
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:29,946
These are all valid ways to


69
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:31,796
prototype, but they're not the


70
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:32,516
only solution.


71
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:37,276
Sometimes you can use low-tech


72
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:38,736
physical prototyping techniques


73
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,226
to work through your design


74
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,616
problems before you write a


75
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,436
single line of code.


76
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:45,046
So today I'm going to show you


77
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:46,646
how you can use just the camera


78
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:53,026
app and the world around you to


79
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,976
prototype for AR just like we


80
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:55,696
did for ToastAR.


81
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:57,586
So before we get started,


82
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:58,546
there's two terms you should be


83
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,646
familiar with.


84
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:03,076
First world space.


85
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:04,976
When we talk about world space,


86
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,566
we're talking about design


87
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,886
elements in the world around you


88
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:09,576
and your device.


89
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:13,066
And when we talk about screen


90
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,846
space, we're talking about these


91
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,466
elements on the screen of your


92
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:16,796
device.


93
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:20,216
So let's take a look at the


94
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,376
original design we got for


95
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:22,616
ToastAR and work through our


96
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:23,206
process.


97
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:28,456
In this design, we have a label


98
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,446
in world space which shows us


99
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:32,466
where the toast is from and its


100
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,006
current rating.


101
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:35,916
Now, you may want to jump in and


102
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,196
start coding this immediately.


103
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,726
It looks pretty simple, but


104
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:40,366
instead we're going to save time


105
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,336
and money by making sure we are


106
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,746
building only the right things


107
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:45,426
before we write a single line of


108
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:46,606
code.


109
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:49,166
AR is about the world around


110
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:49,326
you.


111
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:52,386
So testing out your designs is


112
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:54,166
difficult through a single still


113
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,046
or even video.


114
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,816
Physical prototyping, however,


115
00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,446
allows us to do this in an


116
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,516
approachable, low-tech and


117
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:02,646
highly-iterative manner.


118
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,256
So how did we get started here?


119
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,816
Well, we printed out our labels


120
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,366
and stuck them to some


121
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:10,946
toothpicks.


122
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:13,326
I know. I know.


123
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:15,796
It may seem odd, but this


124
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,736
low-tech process is going to


125
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,255
hopefully help us in three ways.


126
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,106
First, we're going to be testing


127
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:23,616
our designs in context.


128
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,776
Remember, AR is about the world


129
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:26,146
around you.


130
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,256
Second, we're going to hopefully


131
00:04:29,256 --> 00:04:30,656
figure out any issues with our


132
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:32,586
design before we write a single


133
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,686
line of code.


134
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:37,246
And third, through this process,


135
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,206
hopefully we'll get new ideas


136
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,136
that will help make ToastAR even


137
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:42,116
better.


138
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:44,646
But who even has a printer these


139
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:45,196
days, right?


140
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:48,656
You can even just draw something


141
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,206
and cut it out.


142
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:54,476
So now that we have our labels


143
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:55,896
attached to our toothpicks,


144
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,336
well, we stick them in a piece


145
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:57,756
of toast.


146
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:01,306
Then, just using the camera app,


147
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,756
we can test this design out in


148
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:03,346
world space.


149
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:07,886
I know. Revolutionary here,


150
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:07,976
right?


151
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,796
[ Applause ]


152
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,636
When we tried this, we learned


153
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:14,796
one thing really quickly.


154
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,426
These labels, at an angle, are


155
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:18,086
pretty difficult to read.


156
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,126
So the label is hard to read at


157
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:20,646
an angle.


158
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:23,266
Maybe we should have it always


159
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:23,976
face the camera.


160
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:26,226
So let's try this out.


161
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,626
So with some help from a


162
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:31,606
co-worker and some extremely


163
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:34,096
sophisticated hardware, okay,


164
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,836
it's a clear ruler but


165
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,076
beautiful.


166
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:39,326
We tested this out.


167
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,496
And we found that yes, the label


168
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:42,846
is easier to read when it's


169
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:43,766
always facing the camera.


170
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:46,436
Well, this behavior is commonly


171
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,726
referred to as billboarding.


172
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,256
And it seems like it'd be pretty


173
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,056
easy to implement in SceneKit


174
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:52,916
using an SCNBillboardConstraint.


175
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:55,746
But before we start coding this,


176
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,296
let's continue to test this


177
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,866
design and make sure we're only


178
00:05:58,866 --> 00:05:59,726
building the right things.


179
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:01,866
So how does the label work when


180
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:03,386
there's a lot more text or when


181
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:04,196
it's at a distance?


182
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:05,456
Well, we can try this out pretty


183
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:06,706
easily too.


184
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:09,416
Again, with the camera app, we


185
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,636
can test this out and we find


186
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:12,806
that yes, it's a little


187
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,956
difficult to read when these


188
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,986
labels are at a distance.


189
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:16,316
Maybe we should bring these


190
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,416
labels on the screen.


191
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,526
So how do we prototype this?


192
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,226
Well, we're talking about screen


193
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,566
space, and we want to do this


194
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:25,796
quickly.


195
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:26,996
So we're going to go ahead and


196
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:27,656
use Keynote.


197
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:30,666
First, we're going to record a


198
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,786
video of our toast.


199
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,136
We'll record a slow pan.


200
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:38,346
And notice that we're going to


201
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,106
pause on the toast to give our


202
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:41,486
upcoming animation some time.


203
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:46,456
Next, we're going to bring this


204
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:47,706
into Keynote.


205
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:50,796
So you'll create a custom


206
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:52,516
document size which matches the


207
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,576
device you're eventually going


208
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:58,046
to put this on and then simply


209
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:59,596
import your video and bring it


210
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:00,086
into Keynote.


211
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:06,136
Third, we're going to animate


212
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,096
our labeling, import our design,


213
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,846
add a move action, give it an


214
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,156
appropriate duration, and move


215
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:16,626
it to the desired destination.


216
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:21,146
Now here's the important part.


217
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,356
We're going to check the build


218
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:24,286
order and make sure our video


219
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:25,956
and our animation begin at the


220
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:28,036
same time but we're giving the


221
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:30,136
animation a delay so it's on


222
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,836
screen when the toast is in the


223
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:32,356
field of view.


224
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:36,616
Finally, we're going to put this


225
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:38,296
on a device and test it out in


226
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:38,936
context.


227
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:43,836
So we'll put it on a device


228
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,086
using Keynote for iOS.


229
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,616
And we'll test this out in


230
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:47,136
context.


231
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:52,326
Great. Looks like we could fit


232
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:53,386
all the text we need on this


233
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:53,676
label.


234
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:55,896
And putting this on screen space


235
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,446
will hopefully make it easier to


236
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:58,716
expand the scope of this label


237
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:01,566
at a future date.


238
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,036
Now let's see how this scales,


239
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:03,196
though.


240
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:03,836
What happens when there's


241
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:05,166
multiple pieces of toast in the


242
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:05,686
field of view?


243
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,636
So using the same techniques,


244
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:09,646
we'll try this out too.


245
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:15,426
Now the problem here is when


246
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:16,606
there's multiple pieces of toast


247
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,966
in the field of view, I have no


248
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,056
idea which piece of toast I'm


249
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,416
currently interacting with.


250
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:24,036
Maybe I should try putting an


251
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,266
indicator in world space so that


252
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,516
I know which piece of toast I'm


253
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:29,456
currently interacting with.


254
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:30,956
Well, we can try this out too,


255
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:31,546
quickly.


256
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,756
So, again, with some help from


257
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,176
our co-worker and our trusty


258
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,336
ruler, we can try this out too.


259
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,346
Print out our design, attach it


260
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,936
to the ruler, and try this out.


261
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:44,796
It's the camera app world space.


262
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,436
This seems to help us.


263
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:48,726
We know which piece of toast


264
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:49,766
we're currently interacting


265
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:50,426
with.


266
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,016
So let's put it all together.


267
00:08:54,206 --> 00:08:56,666
Using the techniques we just


268
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,326
reviewed, we can put together a


269
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,136
rough demo of our prototype.


270
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:01,906
And when we know we're building


271
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:06,036
the right things, we now know we


272
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:07,296
have some high-fidelity


273
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,296
prototypes to base our code off


274
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:11,736
of.


275
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:13,656
In just a few hours, we worked


276
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:14,896
through problems that could have


277
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:18,256
taken us days to code through.


278
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:19,326
So what did we learn?


279
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,586
Well, we learned these labels in


280
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:21,916
world space are difficult to


281
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,586
read at an angle and at a


282
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,276
distance, so we brought them on


283
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:25,846
screen.


284
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,106
But we also learned that we


285
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,436
needed indicators in world space


286
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,716
to let the user know what


287
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:32,806
they're currently interacting


288
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:32,976
with.


289
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:40,636
Physical prototyping allowed us


290
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,426
to test these AR experiences out


291
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:43,186
quickly.


292
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,576
We used the camera app to test


293
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,006
our world space interactions.


294
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:50,916
And we used Keynote to test out


295
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,236
our screen space interactions.


296
00:09:52,236 --> 00:09:54,956
So how did prototyping help us?


297
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:58,276
Well, we tested our ideas, and


298
00:09:58,276 --> 00:09:59,136
now we're going to be saving


299
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:01,056
time and money by making sure we


300
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,406
build the right things before we


301
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:08,816
write a single line of code.


302
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,496
We also got some new ideas along


303
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:11,116
the process.


304
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,216
These ideas helped make ToastAR


305
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:13,766
even better.


306
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,366
And take it from me, it's pretty


307
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:16,746
amazing.


308
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:20,506
Hopefully when you start working


309
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:22,336
on your next project, you now


310
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:25,406
have a few new tools when you


311
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,836
tackle your next AR app.


312
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:28,976
Thank you so much.


313
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:33,500
