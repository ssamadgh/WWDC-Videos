 ## Smart key paths

 One of the headline features of Swift 4 is the new key paths model described in [SE-0161][SE-0161]. Unlike the string-based key paths in Cocoa, Swift key paths are strongly typed.

/*:
 Key paths are formed by starting at a root type and drilling down any combination of property and subscript names.
 
 You write a key path by starting with a backslash: `\Book.title`. Every type automatically gets a `[keyPath: …]` subscript to get or set the value at the specified key path.

 ### Key paths for subscripts
 
 Part of the key path proposal was that key paths can include subscript segments. This would make them very convenient to drill down into collections, especially dictionaries. Unfortunately, the implementation for subscripts didn't make the cut for Swift 4.0, but it will come in a future release.

 ### Type-safe KVO with key paths

 The key-value observing API in Foundation has been revamped to take full advantage of the new type-safe key paths. It is much easier to use than the old API.

 Notice that KVO depends on the Objective-C runtime. It only works in subclasses of `NSObject`, and any observable property must be declared with `@objc dynamic`.

    let name: String

        self.name = name
        self.age = age
