My name is Pedraum Pardehpoosh.

Thanks for joining us today.

We've brought a few people

together that normally don't get


8
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,066
out of the office.

So this is going to be a session


10
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:43,236
that might be a little different


11
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:44,276
than what you're used to here.


12
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:46,336
It's a deeper look into the App

And the staggering numbers that


20
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,846
demonstrate what a smash hit


21
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:56,286
it's been.

00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:01,306
overview of the App Store.

"why" we did it.


29
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:10,246
And we'll go a little deeper


30
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,866
into our emphasis on editorial.


31
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,026
Finally, we'll bring it all back


32
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:15,206

00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:30,316
It had been launched in July of

00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:39,066
There were some prominent

executives at the company that


46
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:41,516
didn't think we'd have more than


47
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:45,836
a thousand apps in the App Store

The structure and the layout of

51
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:49,276
the same.


52
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,246
We changed things here and

00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:51,506

Well at this point in the


80
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:44,826
history of the App Store, we


81
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:46,166
pause to consider how we can


82
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:46,876
make it even better.

00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,926
How we could redesign it from

the ground up.


85
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,366
And as we began doing that, we


86
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:53,426
realized it could serve a few


87
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:54,026
purposes.


88
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,576
One, we thought how can we give


89
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,796
customers a reason to come back


90
00:02:58,796 --> 00:02:59,226
every day?


91
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:00,326
Make it a destination they'd


92

want to visit on a daily basis?


93
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:04,976
Second, we thought this was a


94
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,296
perfect time to double down on


95
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,556
the editorial curation that's


96

since its inception.

00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,936
And finally, we wanted to


99
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:13,146
reflect the significance the


100
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,556

This redesign of the App Store


121
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:57,436
is so significant that we felt


122
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:59,386
it deserved a session dedicated


123
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:00,256
just to this one topic.

00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:10,846
parts of the redesign.

132

so much time has passed.


137

And we are incredibly proud of


138
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:27,756
what it has become.

142
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,086
So why the redesign?


143
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:39,566
Well, it was time for us to take


144
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,636
a long, hard look at the current


145
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,576
store and acknowledge its


146
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:46,116
limitations, as none of us could


147
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:48,056
have predicted its tremendous


148
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:48,406
growth.


149
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,936
So just like every other app and


150
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:53,496
game creator on the App Store,


151
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,036
we asked ourselves two


152
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,766
questions: What are our goals


153
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,156
now?


154
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,206
And how does the current design


155
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:00,946
support them?


156
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,836
For the new store, we touched


157
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,056
every single view and thought


158
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,626
hard about the structure of the


159
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:08,786
app.


160
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,206
Believe me, there were a lot of


161
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:12,386
options on the table.


162
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:15,366
We applied lessons from other


163
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,696
redesigns at Apple, but the


164
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:20,036
final design is unique to the


165
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:20,606
App Store.


166
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:24,156
The end result is a new sense of


167
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:25,996
clarity, a general


168
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:28,156
simplification of the app, and a


169
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:29,726
fresh take on editorial.


170
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,526
The new style of typography


171
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:35,026
helps establish hierarchy on the


172
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:37,256
pages and a sense of space.


173
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:39,876
It guides people throughout


174
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:40,596
their journey.


175
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,436
We've also removed extra layers


176
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:45,546
of UIs such as toggles to help


177
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,106
with the overall experience in


178
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:50,426
the App Store.


179
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:51,726
Let's take a look at our


180
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,616
redesign goals.


181
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:55,986
As you can see, these are


182
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,166
exactly the same as the ones you


183
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,536
heard a few minutes ago.


184
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,386
This alignment of goals helped


185
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:04,836
us create a product that's


186
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,646
integrated, fluid and also


187
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:07,246
beautiful.


188
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,706
We did add one goal from the


189
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:11,526
design side.


190
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:14,436
And that is clarity and


191
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:15,416
simplification.


192
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,316
And it's probably the most


193
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:18,116
important goal.


194
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,696
And I will expand on it later.


195
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:24,226
I want to start by talking about


196
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,416
the App Store as a daily


197
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,386
destination and the editorial


198
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,676
voice on the App Store, as the


199
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,726
two goals are very closely


200
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:31,196
related.


201
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:34,166
To do that, I want to bring up


202
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:34,976
the Today view.


203
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:36,666
You saw it in the Monday


204
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:37,216
keynote.


205
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,066
But let's take a closer look.


206
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:42,746
It all starts with the Today


207
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:42,856
tab.


208
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:45,366
This is our new home for the App


209
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:45,756
Store.


210
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:47,526
This is where we can share our


211
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:49,176
passion for apps and games and


212
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:50,436
celebrate all of you, the


213
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:51,066
creators.


214
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:53,816
This is where you can come and


215
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:55,826
learn our editorial perspective


216
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:57,266
on the world of apps and games.


217
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,166
This view is a dynamic,


218
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,976
ever-changing platform that


219
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:02,366
allows us to feature your


220
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,256
products in a very different


221
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,886
light than ever before.


222
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:10,446
We designed it as a series of


223
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:14,286
cards that update daily and


224
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:15,946
allow us to celebrate your apps


225
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:17,456
and games by telling stories.


226
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,006
We've had this desire to tell


227
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,156
stories for a long time now but


228
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:23,596
haven't been able to do it in a


229
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,366
meaningful and engaging way.


230
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,356
But this is all changing now


231
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:28,426
with the Today tab.


232
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,136
What you see here is our video


233
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:31,466
card.


234
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:34,236
We can highlight your app and


235
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,076
game previews and our


236
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,606
editorially-created videos.


237
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,586
We will be providing helpful


238
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,796
tips and tricks as seen in this


239
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,066
example for VSCO.


240
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,186
And we will be nominating an App


241
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,786
of the Day and a Game of the


242
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:50,106
Day.


243
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:55,666
And we will also be sharing our


244
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,766
curated collections.


245
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:58,696
Some of you might be familiar


246
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:00,066
with our collections, as we've


247
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,586
been creating them for years,


248
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,426
but haven't had a way to


249
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:04,926
highlight them in a predictable


250
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:05,726
way in our UI.


251
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,006
But again, this is different now


252
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:09,406
with the Today tab and these


253
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:09,806
cards.


254
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:12,596
We spent a lot of time thinking


255
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:14,306
about how to best showcase your


256
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:15,826
apps and games in this view.


257
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:18,696
It was important to us that it


258
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,766
looked beautiful, so we spent a


259
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,816
lot of time thinking about every


260
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:25,176
single detail.


261
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:26,676
Everything kept us up at night


262
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,886
for months, be it typography,


263
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:30,536
layout, transitions and


264
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,246
animations.


265
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:35,626
Each card is an entry point for


266
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:36,736
a deeper discovery.


267
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,336
And we also hope to give you


268
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:40,946
some context into why you should


269
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:42,535
tap in and check out that story.


270
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,686
At any given point we will give


271
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:47,326
you up to seven days' worth of


272
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:47,936
content.


273
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:50,086
So if you miss a day or two, you


274
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:51,556
can come back and find it later.


275
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:57,976
Just look for the date markers.


276
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,656
We also included animations on


277
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:02,216
some of these cards to make them


278
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:02,926
come to life.


279
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,396
You've already seen the


280
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,506
auto-playing video.


281
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:06,786
But we hope to bring more


282
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:09,616
movement into this view.


283
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,656
Twelve cards will be ready for


284
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:12,116
launch.


285
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,066
We needed a variety to keep


286
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:15,996
things interesting.


287
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,346
But also to be able to tell


288
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,626
diverse type of stories.


289
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:21,756
And each one of these cards


290
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:23,506
allows us to tell a story in a


291
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:24,236
different way.


292
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:27,406
It was also important that these


293
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,106
cards look good together and


294
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,016
work as a system.


295
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,036
The order in which they appear


296
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:35,376
might be different, so what you


297
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:36,746
see one day might be very


298
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,266
different from what you will see


299
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,436
tomorrow, for example.


300
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:42,586
But, there's a lot of thought


301
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:44,156
that goes into creating these


302
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,326
every single day around the


303
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:46,696
world.


304
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:48,876
We haven't done this before.


305
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,876
And believe me, it keeps things


306
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:52,776
interesting, even at Apple.


307
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:55,196
I do want to share one other


308
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,096
thing about the cards, which is


309
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,166
personally important to me.


310
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,726
That this view is relevant world


311
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,106
wide.


312
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:05,076
So all this content will be


313
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,356
localized and culturally aware


314
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:09,326
in all our territories.


315
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,646
Let's take a closer look at one


316
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:15,376
of these stories.


317
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,256
It focuses on the fact that


318
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:20,126
behind every app there is a


319
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:23,276
story of who made it, what


320
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:25,376
motivated them, and how it was


321
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:25,816
made.


322
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:28,676
It celebrates you and your apps


323
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:29,176
and games.


324
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's dive in.


325
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:38,016
The transition into this story


326
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:39,396
is smooth and fluid.


327
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,846
And it's also easy to go back


328
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:42,916
out to the Today view.


329
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:44,646
Simply tap on the X button or


330
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,116
swipe down on the article.


331
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:49,706
The stories are engaging and


332
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:50,366
informative.


333
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:53,036
Smokey, who leads our editorial


334
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:54,566
team, will come on stage in a


335
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:55,956
bit and talk to you about it in


336
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:56,586
more detail.


337
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,556
But I want to highlight a few


338
00:10:58,636 --> 00:10:59,966
elements of these stories from


339
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,066
the design perspective.


340
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:06,776
We're letting the elements of


341
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:09,006
the stories define the space,


342
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,086
allowing them to breathe and


343
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,466
convey our perspective.


344
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:17,426
The videos let us engage with


345
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,976
the viewer like we've never been


346
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,076
able to do before.


347
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:24,936
And each story is a series of


348
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:27,136
modules defined by our design


349
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:28,386
and editorial teams.


350
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:32,376
We also hope that you will share


351
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:33,856
these stories with one another


352
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,206
and enjoy them as much as we do.


353
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:39,066
The modules allow for


354
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,686
flexibility in terms of how


355
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:41,886
these stories are built.


356
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,706
But they also keep things


357
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,826
consistent from the design side.


358
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:50,476
So we have this common language


359
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,926
that ties them all together,


360
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:53,716
making it easier for people to


361
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:57,486
experience that content.


362
00:11:58,086 --> 00:11:59,436
It's also worth mentioning that


363
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,876
for the first time ever this


364
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,586
editorial content will be


365
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:03,216
searchable.


366
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:05,116
We've actually never had that in


367
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:05,656
the App Store.


368
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:07,086
And we are incredibly excited


369
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:08,866
about this.


370
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:11,131
[ Applause ]


371
00:12:11,246 --> 00:12:11,706
Absolutely.


372
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:15,876
So if you miss a day, or if you


373
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,706
miss some of this content, be it


374
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,126
in the Today tab or any other


375
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,216
place in the App Store, you can


376
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:21,456
simply search for it later.


377
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,466
It will be featured on the


378
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,086
product page as well for that


379
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:25,846
app or game.


380
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,986
And of course, the Today tab


381
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,726
will be part of this App Store


382
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,366
on the iPad.


383
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,526
And that is the Today view.


384
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,466
We're incredibly excited about


385
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,916
how it looks and how it works.


386
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:41,996
But more importantly, about the


387
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:44,316
type of stories it will allow us


388
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:46,076
to tell you every single day.


389
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:50,986
Let's talk about games next.


390
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,136
Games have been always a huge


391
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:55,226
part of the App Store.


392
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,406
But up to this point always


393
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,526
mixed with apps throughout our


394
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:01,806
editorial and charts.


395
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:05,036
Because of their importance and


396
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:07,656
success, we're dedicating a home


397
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,956
just for games in the App Store.


398
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,326
And that is the new Games tab.


399
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,906
It is more than a tab.


400
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:17,256
We're striving to create the


401
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,536
best, world's best game store.


402
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,116
Full of amazing content that


403
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:23,206
people are going to love.


404
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,056
The top of the page allows for


405
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,976
space for more stories to be


406
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,596
dedicated just to games or new


407
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:33,156
releases.


408
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,896
And with more focus on videos,


409
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,436
people will be able to discover


410
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,066
games much more quickly and


411
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,316
engage with them almost


412
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:42,976
immediately.


413
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:48,456
The split between apps and games


414
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,666
also allowed us to make charts


415
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:51,986
much more relevant in the App


416
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:52,406
Store.


417
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,706
So, the charts that you're


418
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:57,386
seeing are specifically


419
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,386
dedicated to games.


420
00:13:58,386 --> 00:14:00,036
And the same is true for apps.


421
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,736
They will not be mixed in.


422
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:05,116
We think this will actually make


423
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,776
it a lot easier to find what's


424
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:10,386
popular on the App Store.


425
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:12,436
The same is true of categories.


426
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:14,566
As some of you may know, games


427
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,006
was just one of the categories


428
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:16,896
in the previous store.


429
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:19,046
Unfortunately, what it meant is


430
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,696
that all the subcategories were


431
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,406
harder to find and all that


432
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:23,866
content was hidden.


433
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:28,536
But creating a tab dedicated for


434
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,396
games, we can take all those


435
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,156
categories and put them on the


436
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,806
top level, making browsing by


437
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:36,886
categories a lot easier and that


438
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:39,406
content a lot easier to find.


439
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:43,386
Throughout the App Store will


440
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:44,986
also be providing more context


441
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,206
for any particular app or game.


442
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,896
The App Store is no longer just


443
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:51,536
app icons.


444
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:54,166
We want to help people find what


445
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,716
they're looking for and make the


446
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:56,856
right download choices.


447
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:59,846
The context can come from your


448
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,326
subtitles that you will be


449
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:02,696
providing for your apps.


450
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,086
And these subtitles are as


451
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:06,586
important as your app names


452
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:07,046
today.


453
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,556
And again, it's to provide


454
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,036
people with more information


455
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,226
about your app and game.


456
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:16,466
The context can also come from


457
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,646
the editorial team.


458
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:19,326
And you will see more and more


459
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:23,266
of it throughout the App Store.


460
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:24,956
And that is the new Games tab.


461
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,636
We're incredibly excited about


462
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,176
having a dedicated home for


463
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:28,546
games.


464
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:30,766
Before we move on, I just wanted


465
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:32,256
to highlight a small but playful


466
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:33,916
detail about the Games tab.


467
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:38,246
Icon. The shape of the rocket is


468
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:39,786
actually based on the leaf from


469
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:40,536
the Apple logo.


470
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:42,276
We thought some of you might


471
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:43,186
find it interesting.


472
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,346
In addition to the Games tab,


473
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,516
we're also creating a new home


474
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:49,936
for apps.


475
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:53,086
All the amazing content that you


476
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:54,916
saw for the Games tab will also


477
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,746
be available in the Apps tab.


478
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,206
From the design perspective


479
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:00,486
there was always this tension


480
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:01,626
between apps and games.


481
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:03,546
And we felt it was a problem we


482
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,606
needed to solve, as apps are


483
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,766
incredibly important and have a


484
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,326
huge impact on how we live our


485
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:10,596
lives.


486
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:13,686
By splitting games and apps we


487
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,186
can give both of them the


488
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:18,836
attention they deserve.


489
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,996
And finding new apps will be so


490
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,176
much easier with App Previews,


491
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:25,206
as you see in this example for


492
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:25,676
Mammals.


493
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:29,486
What you will see in both tabs


494
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:30,756
are in-app purchases.


495
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:33,276
Up to this point they had a very


496
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:34,426
limited presence in the App


497
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:34,836
Store.


498
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:37,666
But we're changing it completely


499
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,746
with this redesign.


500
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:40,906
They will be much more


501
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,716
accessible and discoverable


502
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:46,236
throughout the App Store.


503
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:47,636
You will see them on the Today


504
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:47,746
tab.


505
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,586
We actually designed a card


506
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:50,656
specifically for in-app


507
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:51,066
purchases.


508
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,146
They will be highlighted on the


509
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,176
Apps and Games tab.


510
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,126
And they will be searchable.


511
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:58,626
They will also be featured by


512
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,186
you on your product pages.


513
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:01,746
It is a complete story.


514
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,106
What's probably even more


515
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,656
important, how easy it is to get


516
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:08,476
the in-app purchases, especially


517
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,445
if you have the app installed on


518
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:10,986
your own device.


519
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,576
I'm going to start with the


520
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:14,036
Today tab and the card


521
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,205
specifically designed for the


522
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:16,856
in-app purchases.


523
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:18,846
I'm going to tap on the Buy


524
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:19,336
button.


525
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:21,465
The app will open.


526
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:24,876
And the purchase sheet will come


527
00:17:26,226 --> 00:17:26,316
up.


528
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:28,316
I can confirm with Touch ID and


529
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:29,376
I'm done.


530
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,726
It's simple and direct.


531
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:37,716
[ Applause ]


532
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:39,446
When designing the visual


533
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:40,766
treatment for in-app purchases,


534
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:42,856
it was important to us that


535
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:44,216
these wouldn't be confused for


536
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,296
being app icons.


537
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,816
We started with the image that


538
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,966
you will be providing for


539
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:50,396
featuring your in-app purchases.


540
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:53,306
And we added a framing system


541
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:54,966
that helps convey what these


542
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:57,096
truly are, in addition to an app


543
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:57,726
or a game.


544
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:00,086
And the [inaudible] helps


545
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:03,256
communicate that as well.


546
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:05,926
The curve of the frame actually


547
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,156
follows the shape of the app


548
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:09,056
icons on the App Store today.


549
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,286
And the way we think of in-app


550
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,106
purchases is that they are the


551
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:15,026
smaller part of the larger


552
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:18,846
piece, which is the app itself.


553
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,486
It was also still important to


554
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:23,076
us to keep that connection


555
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:24,676
between the in-app purchase and


556
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:25,426
the parent app.


557
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:28,726
So we added the app icon in the


558
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,806
lower left corner, again for


559
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:31,536
more context.


560
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,756
If you would like to feature


561
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:36,866
your in-app purchases on a


562
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,466
store, you will need to submit


563
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,226
an image for every single one of


564
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:41,266
your in-app purchases.


565
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:43,726
It needs to be a custom design


566
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:46,176
asset that helps describe what


567
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:47,556
your in-app purchase is about.


568
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,876
It should not be a screen shot


569
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:52,136
from your app or an app icon.


570
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:57,456
The last goal, clarity and


571
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,766
simplification, is also the most


572
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,036
important, like I mentioned


573
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:02,426
earlier, from the design


574
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,056
perspective.


575
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:05,406
It also had the biggest


576
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:06,876
influence on the entire


577
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:07,576
redesign.


578
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,576
When designing our products, we


579
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:13,046
constantly ask ourselves: Is


580
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:13,876
this simple enough?


581
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,886
Is this clear to everyone?


582
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,976
And can we achieve the same goal


583
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:19,366
with less?


584
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,956
The most significant area of the


585
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,396
App Store that probably


586
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,156
demonstrates how this goal


587
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,586
affected our process is the


588
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:29,386
Product page.


589
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:31,726
This is also home for your apps.


590
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:32,916
So I want to spend a little more


591
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,306
time on it.


592
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,916
Over the years, we've added a


593
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,286
lot of different features to


594
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:41,316
this page without having the


595
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,256
opportunity to take a step back


596
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:44,646
and look at it holistically.


597
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:47,106
We knew we had to simplify,


598
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,736
especially the top of the page,


599
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:51,396
as this is what your customers


600
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:52,206
see first.


601
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,256
And all of the relevant


602
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:56,016
information had to be clearly


603
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:56,726
communicated.


604
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,466
We wanted to highlight this


605
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:03,846
app's achievement on the App


606
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:04,316
Store.


607
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,876
So its star rating, Editor's


608
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:09,176
Choice and charting position, if


609
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:09,826
available.


610
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,656
We included age rating to this


611
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:13,786
section, as we know it's


612
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,426
incredibly important, especially


613
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,006
for those of us who are parents.


614
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:19,936
All this information had to be


615
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:23,176
quickly scannable and easy to


616
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:24,616
understand.


617
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,986
Videos and screenshots are still


618
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:28,556
the heroes of this page, just


619
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:29,466
like they are today.


620
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:31,696
But now with auto-playing video,


621
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,216
this page comes to life.


622
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,656
You will also get up to three


623
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:38,036
videos versus just one.


624
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,976
And we know that people want to


625
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:42,406
engage with beautiful app


626
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:42,956
previews.


627
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:44,896
And we will feature them much


628
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:49,066
more heavily throughout our UI.


629
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:54,096
We redesigned how we communicate


630
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,446
if this app is universal.


631
00:20:57,196 --> 00:20:58,806
This is also how you see screen


632
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:00,256
shots from the other devices.


633
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:02,936
We enjoy apps that have been


634
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,146
designed and work on all the


635
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:05,046
different devices.


636
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:10,916
We drastically simplified how we


637
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:13,906
present ratings and reviews.


638
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:18,416
They're much easier to read, and


639
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,196
their presentation has -- their


640
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,736
graphic presentation has been


641
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:22,246
refined.


642
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:26,116
We've removed the All versions


643
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:28,836
versus Current version split


644
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:29,726
between ratings.


645
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:31,856
So updating your apps will no


646
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,826
longer hide your ratings the way


647
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,276
it does today.


648
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:41,876
[ Applause ]


649
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:43,926
The reviews are really easy to


650
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:44,476
navigate.


651
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,226
Simply swipe to the left or tap


652
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:47,226
on the CL link.


653
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,536
And we included the Editor's


654
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:52,236
Choice in this section as well.


655
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:53,616
So all the reviews are in one


656
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:54,016
place.


657
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:56,166
The information section


658
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,806
underwent a makeover as well.


659
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:01,316
So it's a lot easier to read.


660
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:03,296
And we are featuring more apps


661
00:22:03,296 --> 00:22:05,576
and games by this developer on


662
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,976
this page or any other products


663
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,556
that are related and you might


664
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:09,846
like.


665
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,046
Lastly, it was important to us


666
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:17,266
to make it easy for you as you


667
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,326
scroll down the page to download


668
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:19,526
the app.


669
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:22,836
We love the bar that comes down


670
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:24,446
as you absorb the content.


671
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:27,116
The transition is smooth and the


672
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:28,646
bar is integrated with the


673
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,036
overall page design.


674
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:34,086
And that is the redesigned App


675
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:34,396
Store.


676
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:37,186
We worked hard to make the new


677
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:38,776
store a place people will love


678
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:40,406
and will want to come to every


679
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:40,716
day.


680
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:42,116
And we hope you agree.


681
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:44,286
Next, I want to invite Smokey


682
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:45,726
Fontaine to talk to you about


683
00:22:45,726 --> 00:22:47,486
our editorial strategy for the


684
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:48,176
new App Store.


685
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:49,926
Thank you all for your


686
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:50,330
attention.


687
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:54,566
[ Applause ]


688
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:55,546
>> Thank you, Monika.


689
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:58,396
Thank you, Monika, so much for


690
00:22:58,396 --> 00:22:59,676
showing us that beautiful,


691
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:00,896
beautiful redesign.


692
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:02,756
My name is Smokey Fontaine.


693
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,136
And yes, that is my real name.


694
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:06,806
In many ways I'm glad they don't


695
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:07,806
let me touch the product.


696
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:08,946
I only get to touch the


697
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:09,696
editorial.


698
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:11,966
I am the editorial director here


699
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:13,016
of the App Store.


700
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,796
It is my great pleasure to


701
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:16,536
really talk to us about what


702
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,706
does "editorial" mean for the


703
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:19,336
App Store?


704
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:22,026
How does original content, how


705
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,606
will it bring our customers to


706
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:25,066
the store in new and exciting


707
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:25,606
ways?


708
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:27,046
And how can our added


709
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:29,196
perspective really transform the


710
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:30,976
store from the phenomenal


711
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,146
service and utility it has


712
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:34,726
always been to a place where our


713
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,426
users and our customers can come


714
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,966
back and read, watch, and


715
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:41,346
listen, and discover more than


716
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:43,486
they ever, ever have before.


717
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:47,516
Here's what we're going to


718
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:48,086
cover.


719
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:49,906
Our editorial principles.


720
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:51,726
We have the set of new tabs, as


721
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:53,016
you've seen today, games and


722
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:53,486
apps.


723
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,216
More options for you.


724
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:58,076
And we'll end with the big


725
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:58,436
question.


726
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:01,546
Let's start with who we are.


727
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:03,956
Who is the Editorial Team?


728
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:05,846
Well, first and foremost, we are


729
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:06,476
fans.


730
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:08,806
We are fans of all of the work


731
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:09,386
that you do.


732
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,426
We really, really love this


733
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:10,666
stuff.


734
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,376
In fact, I'm standing here right


735
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:13,676
now without my phone.


736
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,346
And I'm feeling a little lonely.


737
00:24:15,346 --> 00:24:16,556
How many folks have actually


738
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,666
used an app since this


739
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:18,806
presentation has been on?


740
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:20,876
Anyone? How many people have


741
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,886
played a game since this


742
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:22,826
presentation has been on?


743
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:24,596
Anyone? Well, maybe you're even


744
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,496
making, you're finishing your


745
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:27,016
apps and polishing up your games


746
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:27,726
as we speak.


747
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,506
And that's what we love to do as


748
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:29,906
well.


749
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:31,596
In fact, all of our App Store


750
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,186
editors around the world wake up


751
00:24:33,186 --> 00:24:35,316
really excited to try to find


752
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:36,596
that innovative new app that


753
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:37,846
could change someone's life.


754
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:40,006
Or that exciting game that


755
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,296
customers will spend hours and


756
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,656
hours and hours playing.


757
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:44,846
We care deeply about all the


758
00:24:44,846 --> 00:24:45,986
recommendations we make.


759
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,276
And it is true.


760
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:49,606
We play every game we recommend.


761
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:51,996
And we use every app that we


762
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:52,576
recommend.


763
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,606
The redesign is so exciting for


764
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:56,356
us because now we have the


765
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:57,866
ability to provide even more


766
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,216
context, even more perspective,


767
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:02,316
and in many ways a narrative to


768
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:03,296
our recommendations.


769
00:25:03,546 --> 00:25:04,956
So customers can come and find


770
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:06,646
everything they want and need


771
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:07,226
and love.


772
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:09,166
Find all of the work that you


773
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:09,746
create.


774
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:12,626
We have a set of editorial


775
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:13,386
principles.


776
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,256
And if you come to our story


777
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:17,296
rooms around the world, and this


778
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:18,966
is not just in Cupertino, but


779
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:20,726
this is in London and Tokyo.


780
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:21,746
This is in Seoul.


781
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:23,546
This is even in Dubai.


782
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:25,436
These editorial principles


783
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:27,676
really guide the writing that we


784
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:28,466
will write.


785
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:30,296
They will guide our creative


786
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:31,086
process.


787
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:33,366
We start with the first one.


788
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:34,936
We celebrate apps.


789
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:36,686
This for us is really our most


790
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:37,406
important point.


791
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,806
Now that we have a bigger


792
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:42,336
editorial platform, it does not


793
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:43,476
mean that we're going to all of


794
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:44,696
a sudden start reviewing apps.


795
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,096
It does not mean that we're


796
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:47,096
going to all of a sudden going


797
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:48,776
to start criticizing apps.


798
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:49,856
We are cheer leaders.


799
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,196
Unapologetic cheerleaders of


800
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:53,696
apps and app culture.


801
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:55,946
For us, it's really the most


802
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:57,416
creative work in the world.


803
00:25:57,636 --> 00:25:58,706
And that is our number one


804
00:25:58,706 --> 00:25:59,206
principle.


805
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:01,996
We celebrate apps.


806
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,946
Second is that we are the voice


807
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,116
of the App Store.


808
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:06,216
You know, during this redesign


809
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,616
we thought long and hard about


810
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:08,876
not only what we're going to


811
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:10,676
write, but how we're going to


812
00:26:10,676 --> 00:26:11,056
write it.


813
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:13,226
It's a big responsibility to be


814
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:13,896
that voice.


815
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,086
It's a big responsibility to


816
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,706
kind of be the mouthpiece to


817
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:17,726
hundreds and hundreds of


818
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:18,846
millions of customers.


819
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,596
And for that we want to kind of


820
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:21,976
be authentic to who we are.


821
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,286
We want it to be smart and fun.


822
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,446
We want it to be humble, for


823
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:26,976
sure.


824
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:28,126
And very friendly.


825
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:29,256
Hopefully, a lot of our work


826
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:29,936
will be in a kind of


827
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:31,276
conversational tone.


828
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,106
And of course, we want to be


829
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:34,506
passionate about all the stuff.


830
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,316
We are going to be very Apple.


831
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:37,566
We're going to obsess over every


832
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,706
word, every word, every word, so


833
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:40,966
that our customers can -- we can


834
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,696
help them and engage them as


835
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:43,896
best as we can.


836
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:46,406
What's our third principle?


837
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:48,096
Well, we offer independent


838
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:48,876
insights.


839
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:49,996
What's one of the biggest


840
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:51,256
criticisms of the App Store?


841
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:52,356
Well, that it's all paid


842
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:53,086
marketing, right?


843
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:54,886
Many of you in this room may


844
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:57,626
have tried to engage us with


845
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:58,976
suggestions to feature one of


846
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,216
your apps or feature one of your


847
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:00,696
games.


848
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:02,896
And you probably know that money


849
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:04,336
isn't the answer to that.


850
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,186
Well, nothing in the redesigned


851
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:08,516
App Store on Today Games or Apps


852
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:10,066
is advertising.


853
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:12,086
We are strong experts with an


854
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:13,376
editorial point of view.


855
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,306
And we are great storytellers


856
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:16,836
with a personality and with a


857
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,346
perspective that we want to


858
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:18,696
share.


859
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:19,776
Now, why is this important?


860
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,066
We want customers to really


861
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:23,526
trust the recommendations that


862
00:27:23,526 --> 00:27:23,986
we make.


863
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:25,876
We want them to be able to rely


864
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,796
on what we share with them.


865
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:30,056
Why? So they'll ultimately come


866
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:32,166
back every day and find


867
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,716
tremendous value in the App


868
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:34,776
Store's editorial.


869
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:37,856
Fourth. While we wordsmith this


870
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,596
a lot, let me tell you.


871
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:39,726
We tell interesting and


872
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:40,556
important stories.


873
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:41,486
First it was, "We tell


874
00:27:41,486 --> 00:27:42,536
interesting stories."


875
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:44,696
Then it was, "We tell insanely


876
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:45,986
interesting stories."


877
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:47,356
And this is where we landed,


878
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,986
"Interesting and important


879
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:49,356
stories."


880
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:51,476
Now, for sure, not every single


881
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,486
story on Today is going to be


882
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:54,736
super, super important.


883
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,156
But we're going to try really,


884
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:57,456
really hard to make sure that


885
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,316
they are very interesting.


886
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:01,466
They key for us is that us being


887
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:02,636
able to say that this app is


888
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:04,536
great is no longer enough.


889
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,706
In the current app store, that's


890
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:07,596
what we say.


891
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,206
And we feature and promote those


892
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:09,516
apps.


893
00:28:09,906 --> 00:28:11,486
In our new design, newly


894
00:28:11,486 --> 00:28:12,896
designed App Store, we will say


895
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:14,146
that app is great, but then


896
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:16,786
explain why we believe it is to


897
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:17,576
our customers.


898
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:18,636
We're here to provide


899
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,396
thought-provoking ideas and


900
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:21,956
really offer that context.


901
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:25,216
Our fifth and last principle is


902
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,966
we deliver a fresh and


903
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:29,016
unexpected take.


904
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:30,326
You know, the world of apps is


905
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:31,956
moving at a ridiculous speed.


906
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,856
It is our job, we believe, to


907
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:36,606
reflect that innovative culture.


908
00:28:36,606 --> 00:28:37,876
You guys are pushing the world


909
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:38,286
ahead.


910
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:40,146
All of you are shaping our lives


911
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:41,706
with what you create.


912
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,086
And often you've changed things


913
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:45,196
in ways that are totally


914
00:28:45,196 --> 00:28:45,876
unexpected.


915
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:47,266
So, we want to try to keep up


916
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:47,706
with you.


917
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:49,626
Keep up with that speed.


918
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:51,086
And for us, we kind of call this


919
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:53,196
our "the crazy ones" principles.


920
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:54,876
A fresh and unexpected take.


921
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:57,906
So these five principles all


922
00:28:57,906 --> 00:28:59,326
together: We celebrate apps.


923
00:28:59,326 --> 00:29:00,636
We are the voice of the App


924
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:01,196
Store.


925
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,006
We offer independent insights.


926
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:03,976
We tell interesting and


927
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,936
important stories.


928
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,306
And we deliver a fresh and


929
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:07,186
unexpected take.


930
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,786
When we do all this, if around


931
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:11,506
the world we abide by these


932
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:13,436
principles, then hopefully the


933
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,066
Today tab and the whole new App


934
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,936
Store become a pretty fabulous


935
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,956
document of app culture.


936
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,246
And for us at the App Store, app


937
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:22,716
culture in almost every single


938
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:24,856
way is culture.


939
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:27,166
All right.


940
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,666
The new tabs: Today, Games, and


941
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,186
Apps.


942
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:31,806
Each of these tabs have the same


943
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:32,476
goal.


944
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:33,996
But we approach them


945
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:34,836
differently.


946
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:36,466
Today, well, Today is going to


947
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,416
be updated every day.


948
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:38,556
Don't really have a choice


949
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:38,866
there.


950
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:39,486
Hence the name.


951
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,066
It's going to have a very


952
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,536
focused perspective.


953
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:45,186
It's going to be highly


954
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:46,126
contextual.


955
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:48,326
And when customers tap on cards


956
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:50,096
in Today, they can actually go


957
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:52,436
directly to buy that app or game


958
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:53,126
from the card.


959
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,066
Or of course, tap in and read


960
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,156
one of our stories.


961
00:29:56,936 --> 00:29:58,106
The Games and Apps tabs are


962
00:29:58,106 --> 00:29:58,876
going to be different.


963
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,436
In many ways you can think about


964
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:03,076
those as a 2.0 version or a


965
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:04,406
newly evolved version of the


966
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:06,486
Feature tab now, including


967
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:08,116
categories and including charts,


968
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:08,956
as you're seeing.


969
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:10,186
Well, the Games and Apps tabs


970
00:30:10,186 --> 00:30:11,346
are going to be updated often.


971
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:12,506
Not every day.


972
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:14,386
But more often than the weekly


973
00:30:14,386 --> 00:30:16,366
that you see in today's cadence.


974
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:17,416
Games and Apps are going to


975
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,886
offer a broader selection.


976
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,386
And it's generally going to be a


977
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,006
more transactional experience.


978
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,966
Taps on Games and Apps will take


979
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:25,746
customers directly to our


980
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,496
amazing new product pages.


981
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:31,736
Well, let me chat a little bit


982
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:33,276
about what we call our Story


983
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:34,256
Framework.


984
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:35,996
As you're seeing, stories on the


985
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:37,436
App Store will cover many, many


986
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:37,926
things.


987
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,216
We'll have world premieres.


988
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:40,416
We'll have major updates.


989
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,746
We'll have tips and tricks and


990
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:43,026
interviews with developers and


991
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:44,086
lists upon lists.


992
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:46,076
Well, our job is to write about


993
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:47,056
what we think customers will


994
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:48,916
find most interesting about an


995
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:49,466
app or a game.


996
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:50,866
And we really believe every app


997
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:52,136
has a story to tell.


998
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:54,626
There are four main topics of


999
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:55,766
stories for us.


1000
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:57,256
When we think about all the


1001
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,806
range, the broad, broad range of


1002
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,366
ideas that we have, we try to


1003
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,426
make -- we needed to make sense


1004
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:02,736
of that.


1005
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,086
So we started with just an idea


1006
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:04,726
of topics.


1007
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,576
What are the four main topics


1008
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:07,316
that we will cover?


1009
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,386
And for each topic we kind of


1010
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:10,526
have a statement of belief.


1011
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:12,246
This is something that we really


1012
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:15,246
want to have customers feel in


1013
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:16,456
the writing and the content that


1014
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:17,046
we create.


1015
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,456
Our first topic is, of course,


1016
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:19,506
gaming.


1017
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:21,316
Whether it's a big name game or


1018
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:22,376
a small indie who has a


1019
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:23,856
car-based strategy, RPG,


1020
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:25,616
Infinite Runner, it doesn't


1021
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:25,866
matter.


1022
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:26,976
The games you make are so


1023
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,636
innovative and so creative, our


1024
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:30,916
game editors really believe


1025
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:31,346
that, you know what?


1026
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:32,526
Apps are the future of gaming.


1027
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,146
In many ways apps are the


1028
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:35,566
present of gaming.


1029
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,086
Anyone agree with that comment?


1030
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:38,416
Apps are the present of gaming?


1031
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:40,816
Hey, we do have the biggest


1032
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,126
gaming platform in the world.


1033
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:43,106
And you know, we're very


1034
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:45,226
enthusiastic about expressing to


1035
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,596
our customers what we believe


1036
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:48,426
the future is in games.


1037
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:51,016
Our second topic: Lifestyle.


1038
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,036
Well, what do we believe there?


1039
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,326
Apps transform your life.


1040
00:31:53,556 --> 00:31:54,726
Whether it's social networking


1041
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:55,516
or photography.


1042
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:56,686
Whether it's dating or fitness


1043
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:58,556
or cooking or transportation,


1044
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,136
apps have helped us live in ways


1045
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,206
that we've never, ever, ever


1046
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:03,046
thought possible.


1047
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:04,636
And we believe in our lifestyle


1048
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:06,336
coverage that apps transform


1049
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:06,976
your life.


1050
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:08,936
Third, culture and


1051
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:09,426
entertainment.


1052
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:10,796
Apps shape culture.


1053
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,026
Well, this is music, film,


1054
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:12,576
fashion.


1055
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:14,366
This is TV, pop culture and


1056
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,936
everything in between.


1057
00:32:16,256 --> 00:32:17,426
The App Store is going to bring


1058
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:18,456
all that together.


1059
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:20,276
And so App Store [inaudible]


1060
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:22,296
content may talk to celebrities.


1061
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,076
We may talk to influencers.


1062
00:32:24,196 --> 00:32:25,736
We may talk to culture creators


1063
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,286
of all kinds about the world of


1064
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:29,806
apps and games because we


1065
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:31,626
believe apps really do shape


1066
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:32,036
culture.


1067
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,356
And our fourth and final topic


1068
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:36,166
is, of course, new tech and


1069
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:36,766
innovation.


1070
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,096
This is all things new, new,


1071
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:38,526
new.


1072
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:39,546
New services.


1073
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:40,326
New ideas.


1074
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,356
New capabilities.


1075
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:42,926
Completely new ways of getting


1076
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:44,336
things done with your iPhone or


1077
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:44,736
iPad.


1078
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:46,516
And we really feel that we can


1079
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,016
provide a service to customers


1080
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:49,986
to help them figure it all out.


1081
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:51,556
Help them get great use out of


1082
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:52,856
all the innovative work that you


1083
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:53,236
do.


1084
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:54,836
And help them potentially be


1085
00:32:54,836 --> 00:32:57,056
introduced into a whole new way


1086
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,276
of doing things.


1087
00:32:58,606 --> 00:33:00,026
In many ways it's very Apple of


1088
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:00,286
us.


1089
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:01,476
We want to make the complex


1090
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,466
world of technology simple.


1091
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,066
All right.


1092
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,576
Four topics: Gaming, lifestyle,


1093
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:07,736
culture and entertainment, and


1094
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,896
new tech and innovation.


1095
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:10,546
When we take these topics, and


1096
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:12,456
once we've decided on one, then


1097
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,056
we want to apply what we call an


1098
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:14,836
"intention."


1099
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:15,726
And this is essentially the


1100
00:33:15,726 --> 00:33:17,286
purpose or the goal of each


1101
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,966
story that you will see on the


1102
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:19,436
App Store.


1103
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:20,376
There are three of those.


1104
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:22,236
The first we call "Inform."


1105
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:24,056
This is about being timely.


1106
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:25,616
This is about giving customers


1107
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:27,006
"need-to-know" information.


1108
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:28,676
This is to obviously let them


1109
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:29,736
know what's happening in the


1110
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:31,086
world right now.


1111
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:33,116
For example, you can say a new


1112
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:34,826
show is launching on Netflix.


1113
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:36,106
And if we do that well, our


1114
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:38,186
customer reaction may very


1115
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:39,456
likely be: "Cool.


1116
00:33:39,636 --> 00:33:41,746
I want to get that."


1117
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:43,306
Our second intention is simply


1118
00:33:43,306 --> 00:33:44,046
called "Help."


1119
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:45,666
Really, really important for us.


1120
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:46,396
This is about being


1121
00:33:46,396 --> 00:33:47,096
instructional.


1122
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:47,806
This is about being


1123
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:48,526
motivational.


1124
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,466
This is about sharing ideas that


1125
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:52,556
may be intuitive for us but not


1126
00:33:52,556 --> 00:33:54,306
for all of our customers.


1127
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:55,516
How to get the most out of


1128
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:57,066
Instagram's new feature could be


1129
00:33:57,316 --> 00:33:58,176
a helpful topic.


1130
00:33:58,816 --> 00:34:00,886
And for us, this can be a really


1131
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:03,126
helpful way of reengaging our


1132
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,346
customers with some apps that


1133
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:05,986
they may have downloaded, may


1134
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:07,476
knew they loved them, but


1135
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:08,866
they've been left idle.


1136
00:34:09,076 --> 00:34:10,356
So how can we reengage our


1137
00:34:10,356 --> 00:34:11,545
customers with some of those


1138
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,556
apps and even games by helping


1139
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:15,146
them, giving them new ideas of


1140
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:17,116
how to use one of these great


1141
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:17,545
things?


1142
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:20,286
And third, it's "Inspire."


1143
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:22,005
This is going to be the topic


1144
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,886
area or the intention where we


1145
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:25,485
have really creative content,


1146
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,226
really motivational content,


1147
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:27,985
really insightful.


1148
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:28,815
This is going to be everything


1149
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:29,976
from a twelve-year-old making an


1150
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,606
app to the 82-year-old making an


1151
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:33,806
app, both of whom were here this


1152
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:34,226
year.


1153
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,525
This is inspiring content that


1154
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:39,005
may go global around the world.


1155
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,676
Inform, help and inspire.


1156
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:43,466
If we inform, "Cool.


1157
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:44,416
I want to get that."


1158
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,235
If we help, "I had no idea.


1159
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,996
Thanks." And if we inspire,


1160
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:48,545
"Wow!


1161
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:49,876
That's super interesting."


1162
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:51,045
And of course, we are not going


1163
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:52,406
to count any of those reactions


1164
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,076
unless customers use those exact


1165
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:56,085
phrases on the screen.


1166
00:34:58,086 --> 00:34:59,776
Let's see how this all comes


1167
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:00,086
together.


1168
00:35:00,086 --> 00:35:00,496
All right.


1169
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:02,406
Our first world premiere ever,


1170
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:03,926
ever, ever is "The Art of the


1171
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:04,706
Impossible.


1172
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,756
Inside the extraordinary world


1173
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,376
of Monument Valley 2."


1174
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:09,726
Well, why did we choose this?


1175
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:11,606
First and foremost, it comes


1176
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:12,946
back to our first principle,


1177
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,476
which was Monument Valley 2 is


1178
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:15,836
an awesome, awesome game.


1179
00:35:15,836 --> 00:35:17,026
How many folks have tried it so


1180
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:17,376
far?


1181
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:19,546
Since Monday release.


1182
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,476
I can say I have not even got


1183
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:22,166
very far.


1184
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,846
But it's a phenomenal,


1185
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:24,846
phenomenal game.


1186
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:27,056
And Ustwo did a great job with


1187
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:27,226
this.


1188
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,846
So first and foremost, we chose


1189
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:30,226
Monument Valley 2 as our world


1190
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:31,776
premiere because the game is


1191
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:32,836
flat our awesome.


1192
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:35,436
Secondly, the Ustwo team gave us


1193
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:36,946
great access to their


1194
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:38,016
development process.


1195
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,436
They allowed us in and we got to


1196
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:40,066
meet with some of their


1197
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,256
creatives and speak to some of


1198
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:42,366
their art directors about what


1199
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:44,176
inspired them to make Monument


1200
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:44,846
Valley 2.


1201
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:46,406
That was really interesting and


1202
00:35:46,406 --> 00:35:47,706
exciting for us because we knew


1203
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:49,416
we could tell that story, then,


1204
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,226
to customers.


1205
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,246
And thirdly, we knew we had a


1206
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,866
great story for customers about


1207
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:54,886
Monument Valley 2.


1208
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,336
And of course it helped that it


1209
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:58,476
was only available on iOS.


1210
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:01,536
All right.


1211
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:02,626
There's a moment in the third


1212
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:03,936
stage of Monument Valley 2 when


1213
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,276
a landslide separates mother


1214
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:05,756
from child.


1215
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:06,726
I actually did get to this


1216
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:07,056
level.


1217
00:36:07,446 --> 00:36:09,796
To get her little one back, mom


1218
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,226
must navigate through intricate,


1219
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:13,386
artfully-crafted puzzle that


1220
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:14,886
constantly evolves.


1221
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:16,606
There was an actual moment, I


1222
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:17,846
got to it later, but one of our


1223
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:19,096
game editors, this really


1224
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:19,966
happened to him.


1225
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:20,836
He was playing and it's like "Oh


1226
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:21,086
my God.


1227
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:22,246
It was such an awesome moment."


1228
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,226
Then they embrace after.


1229
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:24,466
And it really kind of moved him.


1230
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,666
And we said, "You know what?


1231
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,406
That's the intro to our Monument


1232
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:28,456
Valley 2 story."


1233
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:30,506
We've seen some of the beautiful


1234
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:31,096
designs.


1235
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:33,006
We've seen how the copy flows in


1236
00:36:33,006 --> 00:36:34,946
between these great images and


1237
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:35,956
in-line video.


1238
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:37,166
And of course, we have pull


1239
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:37,626
quotes.


1240
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:39,446
Apple didn't invent pull quotes,


1241
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,916
but it's really nice to see them


1242
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,556
on the App Store.


1243
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:44,276
Here we quoted us to studio head


1244
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:45,956
Dan Gray, who wants to change


1245
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,226
people's perceptions of what


1246
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:48,516
games can be.


1247
00:36:48,796 --> 00:36:50,436
That's our first world premiere


1248
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:52,456
of Monument Valley 2.


1249
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,406
Here is our first How To column.


1250
00:36:54,406 --> 00:36:55,836
Monika spoke about a little bit


1251
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:56,766
earlier.


1252
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:57,176
And you know what?


1253
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:58,746
There are many, many ways we


1254
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:00,826
could have spoken about VSCO.


1255
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:02,166
It's one of our favorite apps


1256
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,146
and one of our favorite photo


1257
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:04,596
filter apps for a long, long


1258
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:05,016
time.


1259
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:07,426
And here we wanted to -- we felt


1260
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,106
the most helpful angle would be


1261
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:11,056
kind of a basic primer of some


1262
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:13,356
of the new features of VSCO that


1263
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,866
many customers may not have used


1264
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:15,146
yet.


1265
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:17,046
Well, let's look at some of


1266
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:18,006
them.


1267
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:19,606
Don't fall on stage.


1268
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:21,806
Like a good denim jacket -- it's


1269
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,046
funny, we had this image.


1270
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,016
It was initially the phrase is


1271
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:26,176
often "like a good leather


1272
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:26,676
jacket."


1273
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,166
We changed it to "like a good


1274
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:28,766
denim jacket."


1275
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:29,866
How many people love the denim


1276
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:31,626
jacket that we gave out WWDC


1277
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:32,586
Swag this year?


1278
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,126
So I'm glad, actually.


1279
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:35,546
Round of applause for the denim


1280
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:35,966
jackets.


1281
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:37,516
[ Applause ]


1282
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:38,556
Well here you are right here.


1283
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,156
Like a good denim jacket.


1284
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:41,556
VSCO's got a coolness factor


1285
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:42,846
that can't be measured.


1286
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:44,366
All right, we wanted to talk


1287
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:45,466
about creating gifts.


1288
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,306
Many folks don't know that you


1289
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,156
can create gifts in VSCO.


1290
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,686
It's a feature that many users,


1291
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,466
both amateur and pro, love to


1292
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:53,946
see.


1293
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:55,106
That was number one.


1294
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:56,986
We go now, we can make journals


1295
00:37:56,986 --> 00:37:57,516
of VSCO.


1296
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,116
We talk about some of their free


1297
00:37:59,326 --> 00:37:59,946
filters.


1298
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:01,916
And of course, we end here with


1299
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,456
the kind of hidden, if you will,


1300
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:04,926
social network that's within


1301
00:38:04,926 --> 00:38:05,376
VSCO.


1302
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:06,646
Tip number five, you can


1303
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:08,146
socialize without having to go


1304
00:38:08,146 --> 00:38:08,896
anywhere else.


1305
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:11,096
So this was our first How To


1306
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:11,546
story.


1307
00:38:13,196 --> 00:38:15,116
This is very interesting because


1308
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:16,546
one of the biggest challenges


1309
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:18,756
about App Store Editorial is how


1310
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:21,096
can we serve a billion people


1311
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:22,136
with perspective?


1312
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:24,176
That's really, really, really


1313
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:24,696
hard.


1314
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:26,666
Well, you have to figure out


1315
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:27,886
first who you want to speak to.


1316
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,016
And it's as important to us on


1317
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,186
the App Store to talk to new


1318
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,556
users as it is to talk to


1319
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:34,636
advanced users.


1320
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:36,196
So this is column is more for an


1321
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:37,076
advanced user.


1322
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,596
We call this a Deep Dive.


1323
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:40,326
Here's it's a conversation about


1324
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:41,046
causality.


1325
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:42,756
One of my game editors was


1326
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:44,196
really excited when he got to


1327
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,116
level 201 because everything


1328
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,996
changes on level 201.


1329
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,486
You want to feel like a genius,


1330
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:51,756
well, you better get there


1331
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:52,306
first.


1332
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:54,106
So this was a story about a


1333
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:56,126
great game in a kind of deeper


1334
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:57,046
context.


1335
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:58,356
We talk about culture and


1336
00:38:58,356 --> 00:38:59,376
entertainment, all right?


1337
00:38:59,376 --> 00:39:00,356
It's the NBA finals.


1338
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:01,596
We know that game is on tonight.


1339
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:02,786
Go Warriors!


1340
00:39:02,786 --> 00:39:04,236
I better not say anything else


1341
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:05,876
in San Jose, California.


1342
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:07,026
Go Warriors.


1343
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:08,416
And when you look at culture and


1344
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,686
entertainment through the lens


1345
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:11,696
of apps, there are two actual


1346
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:12,876
ways that you can enjoy it.


1347
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:14,536
Of course, you can watch the


1348
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:16,716
game live anywhere you are on


1349
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:17,096
ESPN.


1350
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:19,016
But you can also play the game


1351
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:20,346
on NBA Live.


1352
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:21,756
And you can imitate Steph Curry


1353
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:23,036
or LeBron or whoever you'd like


1354
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:25,526
to be on the game itself.


1355
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,326
In many ways the game is


1356
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,926
probably going to be as good as


1357
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:30,226
-- the video game is going to


1358
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:32,156
imitate the real-life game and


1359
00:39:32,156 --> 00:39:33,946
back and forth, seeing how these


1360
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:34,996
players are breaking all these


1361
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:35,926
records these days.


1362
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:37,316
So that's our culture and


1363
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:38,236
entertainment story.


1364
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,316
A couple of examples.


1365
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,086
If there's one thing this


1366
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:43,416
morning I love all of you to


1367
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:45,286
leave here and remember about


1368
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:46,446
the all new App Store is that


1369
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:48,436
there are more ways to be


1370
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:50,936
featured than ever, ever before.


1371
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:52,376
We talked about "Meet the


1372
00:39:52,376 --> 00:39:52,816
Developer."


1373
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:53,366
Well, yes.


1374
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:54,136
You can get interviewed.


1375
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:55,316
Our debut "Meet the Developer"


1376
00:39:55,316 --> 00:39:57,356
piece featured Michelle Kennedy,


1377
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:58,576
the creator of a wonderful new


1378
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:00,056
social media app called Peanut,


1379
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:01,736
which is dedicated to moms.


1380
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:03,386
It's our "Meet the Developer"


1381
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:03,966
column.


1382
00:40:04,306 --> 00:40:05,246
We talked to her about many


1383
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:06,766
things, about her UI and some of


1384
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:07,856
the feature innovations.


1385
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:09,296
And we talked to her about some


1386
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:10,576
of the feedback she's received


1387
00:40:10,856 --> 00:40:12,856
from her Peanut social media app


1388
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,696
and who it's for.


1389
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:16,616
So we're really excited to have


1390
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:17,876
a kind of deeper cultural


1391
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,646
conversation about an app that's


1392
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,046
really meaningful to a lot of


1393
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:21,576
folks.


1394
00:40:22,576 --> 00:40:25,026
"Peanut is human interaction in


1395
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,576
real life, facilitated by


1396
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:28,516
technology," Michelle said.


1397
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:30,456
Another way you can get featured


1398
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:31,876
is, of course, App of the Day.


1399
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,616
Here we chose Hit List.


1400
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:35,936
Game of the Day, Super Senso.


1401
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,656
Strategic sci-fi combat.


1402
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:38,636
Let me pause for a second and


1403
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,026
talk about App of the Day and


1404
00:40:40,026 --> 00:40:40,626
Game of the Day.


1405
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:43,526
We still have Editor's Choice


1406
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:44,106
for sure.


1407
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:45,326
In fact, Editor's Choice is now


1408
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:47,006
a badge on our new product


1409
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:47,386
pages.


1410
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:48,786
App of the Day and Game of the


1411
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:50,776
Day give us a third option of


1412
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,316
really honoring all the great


1413
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:52,886
work you do.


1414
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,346
Think of Editor's Choice like


1415
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:55,166
our Oscars.


1416
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,836
Like our Best Picture, if you


1417
00:40:56,836 --> 00:40:57,186
will.


1418
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:58,476
App of the Day and Game of the


1419
00:40:58,476 --> 00:40:59,336
Day are going to be similarly


1420
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:00,796
high quality, super awesome


1421
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:02,536
apps, but they'll also be pegged


1422
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:04,826
to a story that we may want to


1423
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:05,066
tell.


1424
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:06,816
Another way to be featured is


1425
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,276
Collections.


1426
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:08,036
Collections are going to be on


1427
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:09,086
the Games and Apps tab.


1428
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:11,046
They are also going to be here


1429
00:41:11,046 --> 00:41:13,176
on Today with a cool new design.


1430
00:41:13,836 --> 00:41:15,256
You will see here that Heroes,


1431
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:17,136
what we call Heroes on the Apps


1432
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:17,486
tab.


1433
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:19,036
Here we have AirBNB to


1434
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:20,436
rediscover this.


1435
00:41:20,696 --> 00:41:22,546
And we have Injustice 2 as a new


1436
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,146
game in the Games tab.


1437
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:26,666
Another way to be featured is


1438
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,486
lists, lists and more lists.


1439
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,846
Our debut one is "15 Inspired


1440
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:31,546
Indie Games."


1441
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,336
Customers irrespective of the


1442
00:41:33,336 --> 00:41:35,296
media love lists.


1443
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:36,926
And we love them as well on the


1444
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:38,666
App Store as well.


1445
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:40,056
All right.


1446
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:41,476
This brings us to the end.


1447
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:43,136
The big, big question.


1448
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:44,906
I hope you've enjoyed our kind


1449
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:46,456
of editorial vision.


1450
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:48,626
It really is a marriage of


1451
00:41:48,626 --> 00:41:51,396
expert curation with this idea


1452
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:53,316
of engaging stories and content


1453
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:54,556
for our customers.


1454
00:41:56,396 --> 00:41:57,616
But really all we want to know


1455
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,076
is this: How do you reach us?


1456
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:01,886
Well, I'm happy to announce, and


1457
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,086
many of you, many have already


1458
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:03,566
seen it.


1459
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:04,966
But I'm happy to announce that


1460
00:42:04,966 --> 00:42:07,536
on AppStore.com/promote, that


1461
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:08,796
will redirect to the new


1462
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,696
Developer page where not only


1463
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:13,276
will we ask you about your app


1464
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:14,806
and your game and the features


1465
00:42:14,806 --> 00:42:15,706
and what's cool about it.


1466
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:17,756
We'll also have a new area where


1467
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:19,276
it says, "Tell us your story."


1468
00:42:19,276 --> 00:42:20,886
We're really, really excited to


1469
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:22,756
hear all of the stories you have


1470
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:24,256
to share with us about your


1471
00:42:24,256 --> 00:42:25,866
creative process and what you


1472
00:42:25,866 --> 00:42:26,556
want to share with your


1473
00:42:26,556 --> 00:42:28,496
customers about apps and games.


1474
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,056
So thank you so much.


1475
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:31,536
We're really excited to be on


1476
00:42:31,536 --> 00:42:32,556
this journey together.


1477
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:33,886
Thank you so much.


1478
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,076
I'd like now to bring back Mr.


1479
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,756
Pedraum Pardehpoosh to bring us


1480
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:38,986
home.


1481
00:42:42,816 --> 00:42:43,346
>> Thanks, Smokey.


1482
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:47,336
So you heard some insights into


1483
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:49,126
the why we did this redesign


1484
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,186
from the lead designer herself.


1485
00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:52,226
This is a pretty special thing.


1486
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:53,386
And you heard the insights from


1487
00:42:53,386 --> 00:42:55,426
Smokey about our doubling down


1488
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:56,246
on editorial.


1489
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:59,536
And got contact information for


1490
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,666
how to get in touch with the


1491
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:01,396
Editorial Team.


1492
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:02,726
This is the dawn of a new day, I


1493
00:43:02,726 --> 00:43:03,656
think it's safe to say.


1494
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:05,216
But let's not lose sight of the


1495
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:07,116
fact that ultimately all of


1496
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:08,496
these efforts are meant to


1497
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:09,826
improve the discoverability of


1498
00:43:09,826 --> 00:43:11,456
apps and games on the App Store.


1499
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:13,956
By giving people a reason to


1500
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:15,056
come back to the App Store every


1501
00:43:15,056 --> 00:43:17,236
day and giving the context of


1502
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:17,826
why we're making the


1503
00:43:17,826 --> 00:43:18,916
recommendations that we are.


1504
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:20,906
This redesign is more than just


1505
00:43:20,906 --> 00:43:21,856
a facelift.


1506
00:43:22,706 --> 00:43:24,056
It's created new opportunities


1507
00:43:24,056 --> 00:43:25,316
to get discovered that haven't


1508
00:43:25,316 --> 00:43:26,166
existed before.


1509
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:27,276
Whether it's being included in


1510
00:43:27,276 --> 00:43:28,506
one of the stories that Smokey


1511
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,596
outlined or appearing in the new


1512
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:32,276
Apps and Games tabs, which give


1513
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,716
focus to each of those areas.


1514
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:35,706
But as always, you shouldn't


1515
00:43:35,706 --> 00:43:37,036
just rely on being featured by


1516
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:39,776
the App Store to improve your


1517
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:40,266
app discovery.


1518
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:41,796
There's things you can do even


1519
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:43,826
starting now to get ready for


1520
00:43:43,826 --> 00:43:44,306
the new App Store.


1521
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:44,996
And we're going to talk just a


1522
00:43:44,996 --> 00:43:45,976
couple minutes about them.


1523
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:47,756
The first thing is in-app


1524
00:43:47,756 --> 00:43:48,396
purchases.


1525
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,366
By way of quick review, in-app


1526
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,666
purchases now have a presence on


1527
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:52,246
the App Store.


1528
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:53,576
They can appear on the product


1529
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:54,436
details page.


1530
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:57,036
In featured content areas.


1531
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:58,166
In search results.


1532
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:00,606
And on your product page, excuse


1533
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:01,506
me.


1534
00:44:02,936 --> 00:44:05,176
This new ability combined with


1535
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,846
the new Subscriptions features


1536
00:44:07,256 --> 00:44:08,256
that we announced last year,


1537
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:09,606
giving you brand new


1538
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:10,626
opportunities for creating


1539
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:11,576
sustainable businesses.


1540
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:14,076
So you'll want to start thinking


1541
00:44:14,286 --> 00:44:16,056
now about the title of these


1542
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,006
in-app purchases and the


1543
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:18,746
description and the image that


1544
00:44:18,746 --> 00:44:21,996
you're going to use for them,


1545
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:23,346
particularly now that they have


1546
00:44:23,346 --> 00:44:24,506
such increased visibility.


1547
00:44:25,626 --> 00:44:26,886
There's a couple of StoreKit


1548
00:44:26,886 --> 00:44:29,036
sessions and an iTunes Connect


1549
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:29,866
session where you can get more


1550
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:30,806
information about this.


1551
00:44:31,976 --> 00:44:33,056
We'll review those at the end.


1552
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:35,436
Titles are now 30 characters in


1553
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:36,516
the App Store, in the all new


1554
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:37,006
App Store.


1555
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:38,876
But in addition, you will have a


1556
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:39,506
subtitle.


1557
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:42,286
Monika showed this in context as


1558
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:42,786
well.


1559
00:44:43,176 --> 00:44:44,276
You'll want to think carefully


1560
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:45,956
about how to use this subtitle


1561
00:44:46,576 --> 00:44:47,886
to convey what your app does.


1562
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:48,856
To give a little bit more


1563
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:49,716
information about it.


1564
00:44:49,716 --> 00:44:51,126
To say something compelling.


1565
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:52,936
But don't be misleading.


1566
00:44:55,536 --> 00:44:57,236
Consider using your subtitle to


1567
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,876
highlight a feature or a typical


1568
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,966
use of your app that'll resonate


1569
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:01,656
with your audience.


1570
00:45:02,686 --> 00:45:03,946
And this subtitle will follow


1571
00:45:03,946 --> 00:45:05,276
your app title around throughout


1572
00:45:05,276 --> 00:45:07,776
the app store, whether it's in


1573
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:10,046
the Apps or the Games tab, on a


1574
00:45:10,046 --> 00:45:11,226
product page or in search


1575
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:11,736
results.


1576
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:15,596
Let's talk about video app


1577
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:16,116
previews.


1578
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:17,526
We know that when customers


1579
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:18,686
engage with these video app


1580
00:45:18,726 --> 00:45:21,586
previews, customers tend to


1581
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:24,176
download that app or game more.


1582
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:26,316
And so we thought about, "Well,


1583
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:27,876
how can we make it more obvious


1584
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:28,646
that these are videos?"


1585
00:45:29,796 --> 00:45:30,886
Well, auto-playing is one way


1586
00:45:30,886 --> 00:45:31,416
you can do that.


1587
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,296
And so we really encourage you,


1588
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,206
particularly now that you can


1589
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:35,946
have three of them.


1590
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:38,476
And they can be localized.


1591
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:40,516
You should really be thinking


1592
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:42,926
about how to create a video that


1593
00:45:43,236 --> 00:45:44,636
encourages customers to download


1594
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:48,956
your app or game.


1595
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:51,906
We think video is a big deal on


1596
00:45:51,906 --> 00:45:52,456
the App Store.


1597
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:55,826
You can learn more about what


1598
00:45:55,826 --> 00:45:56,946
makes a compelling video by


1599
00:45:56,946 --> 00:45:58,466
visiting the site, and by


1600
00:45:58,466 --> 00:45:59,626
visiting the App Store labs.


1601
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:04,246
Now, in addition to your app


1602
00:46:04,246 --> 00:46:06,696
description, you can have 170


1603
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:08,166
characters of text, which can be


1604
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:08,926
updated any time.


1605
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:10,126
We call this Promo Text.


1606
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:11,836
This will get concatenated on


1607
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:13,186
top of your app description.


1608
00:46:14,286 --> 00:46:15,376
And it won't require an app


1609
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:15,866
update.


1610
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:18,706
This is a great way to talk


1611
00:46:18,706 --> 00:46:19,646
about one of the new features


1612
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:20,896
that's a temporary feature or a


1613
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:21,896
price promotion that you're


1614
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:23,566
having or some new accolade that


1615
00:46:23,566 --> 00:46:24,516
your app has received.


1616
00:46:25,356 --> 00:46:26,216
This is something else that you


1617
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,216
can start thinking about right


1618
00:46:27,216 --> 00:46:27,496
now.


1619
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:31,596
Let's talk about ratings and


1620
00:46:31,596 --> 00:46:31,856
reviews.


1621
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:32,746
This got some applause.


1622
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:35,416
This warms my heart.


1623
00:46:35,656 --> 00:46:36,856
We did a couple things in iOS


1624
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:40,316
10.3 releasing a Reviews API.


1625
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:43,726
And allowing developers to


1626
00:46:43,726 --> 00:46:44,746
respond to reviews.


1627
00:46:44,746 --> 00:46:45,906
And the response has been


1628
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:46,406
tremendous.


1629
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:49,696
We've seen almost 400,000 --


1630
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:51,166
this number's actually a little


1631
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:51,566
old.


1632
00:46:52,086 --> 00:46:53,496
We've seen almost 400,000


1633
00:46:53,886 --> 00:46:56,046
responses to reviews since the


1634
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:56,506
launch of this.


1635
00:46:56,506 --> 00:46:57,706
And we know that when customers


1636
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:00,106
go back and change their rating


1637
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:01,626
based on a response that they


1638
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:02,846
have received from a developer,


1639
00:47:03,326 --> 00:47:06,146
overwhelmingly that change in


1640
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:07,426
direction is in a positive way.


1641
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:12,226
So this is really important.


1642
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:14,736
In the new App Store, as Monika


1643
00:47:14,736 --> 00:47:16,026
mentioned, we no longer reset


1644
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:17,216
app rating when you submit a new


1645
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:17,726
version.


1646
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:19,956
Which is awesome for many


1647
00:47:19,956 --> 00:47:20,456
developers.


1648
00:47:20,456 --> 00:47:22,676
Some developers wouldn't mind


1649
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:24,166
resetting that rating.


1650
00:47:25,196 --> 00:47:26,716
And now, with the new App Store,


1651
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:28,236
with each submission you're


1652
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:29,326
going to have the ability to do


1653
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:30,616
so, to reset your rating.


1654
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:32,406
But you should be careful about


1655
00:47:32,406 --> 00:47:32,576
that.


1656
00:47:32,576 --> 00:47:34,276
It sounds like an interesting


1657
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:34,716
option.


1658
00:47:34,716 --> 00:47:36,346
But we know that customers value


1659
00:47:36,806 --> 00:47:39,726
that rating or seeing that an


1660
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:41,466
app has ratings, a lot, when


1661
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:42,166
they're making a download


1662
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:42,526
decision.


1663
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,396
So you will want to be careful


1664
00:47:44,956 --> 00:47:47,666
about that.


1665
00:47:47,886 --> 00:47:49,456
You can get advice about best


1666
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:50,906
practices associated with


1667
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:52,706
responding to customer reviews


1668
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:54,796
by visiting this URL.


1669
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:58,576
And like we mentioned, we


1670
00:47:58,576 --> 00:47:59,936
strongly recommend you make


1671
00:47:59,936 --> 00:48:01,826
responding to customer reviews a


1672
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:02,846
regular part of your customer


1673
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:03,666
service hygiene.


1674
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:06,396
And in fact, in July, in iTunes


1675
00:48:06,396 --> 00:48:08,356
Connect, we'll be enabling a new


1676
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:10,906
role in iTunes Connect for


1677
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:12,816
customer service so that you can


1678
00:48:12,816 --> 00:48:14,016
have somebody that's focused


1679
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:14,936
just on that and doesn't have


1680
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:17,786
access to other elements inside


1681
00:48:18,606 --> 00:48:18,696
there.


1682
00:48:19,576 --> 00:48:21,666
We're constantly improving the


1683
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:22,776
way Core Search works in the


1684
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:23,286
Apps Store.


1685
00:48:23,606 --> 00:48:24,766
But the most visible thing we've


1686
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:27,256
done this year is by adding the


1687
00:48:27,256 --> 00:48:28,446
stories that our editors are


1688
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:28,776
writing.


1689
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,956
Additionally, in-app purchases,


1690
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:34,006
categories and developers will


1691
00:48:34,006 --> 00:48:35,186
be able to appear in these


1692
00:48:35,186 --> 00:48:38,236
search results as well.


1693
00:48:38,436 --> 00:48:40,986
Speaking of search, last year we


1694
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:42,226
announced Search Ads.


1695
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:44,266
And it launched in the US.


1696
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:46,716
And it launched in the UK,


1697
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:47,736
Australia and New Zealand in


1698
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:48,046
April.


1699
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,606
The results have been really


1700
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:51,796
strong for advertisers.


1701
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:53,586
High tap through rates.


1702
00:48:54,256 --> 00:48:55,926
Conversion rates above 50%.


1703
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:57,806
And cost per acquisition just


1704
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:58,406
over a dollar.


1705
00:48:58,406 --> 00:48:59,866
These are really impressive


1706

1720
00:49:22,146 --> 00:49:22,966
us are important to your


1721
00:49:22,966 --> 00:49:23,296
business.


1722
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:25,416
Many developers large and small


1723
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,476
have already taken advantage of


1724
00:49:26,476 --> 00:49:26,596

1725
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:27,596
And this is another thing you'll


1726
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:28,976

1727
00:49:29,026 --> 00:49:32,876
find out if it's right for you.


1728
00:49:32,876 --> 00:49:34,556

1729
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:35,766
you to be thinking about even


1730
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,436

1732
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:40,976
app's presence in the Apps.


1733
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:42,016
And we hope you take advantage


1734
00:49:42,016 --> 00:49:43,016
of the folks that are here from


1735
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,626
the App Store this week to learn


1736
00:49:44,626 --> 00:49:46,946
more about this.


1737
00:49:47,646 --> 00:49:48,826
For more information on this


1738
00:49:48,826 --> 00:49:49,996

Come speak with us.


1742
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:00,146
Last thing I want to say is that


1743
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:01,266
it was my honor to be able to


1744
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:02,446
introduce this new App Store


1745
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:03,696
that's been a few years in the


1746
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:04,026
running.


1747
00:50:05,116 --> 00:50:06,906
But it was done with a lot of


1748
00:50:06,906 --> 00:50:07,926
cross-functional work.


1749
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,266
I know some of those folks in


1750
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:10,416
the audience today.


1751
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,866
Those that work in the App Store


1752
00:50:11,866 --> 00:50:12,906
please stand up for a second to


1753
00:50:12,906 --> 00:50:13,656
get recognized.


1754
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,066
Give it up for these folks who


1755
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:16,816
have been working their butts


1756
00:50:16,816 --> 00:50:17,476
off.


1757
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:23,736
[ Applause ]


1758
00:50:24,236 --> 00:50:27,556
Thank you, everybody.
