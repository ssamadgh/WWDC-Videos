1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,369
As an app developer,


2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,104
it's critical that
you know exactly


3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,039
what your app
is storing on disk,


4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,875
where everything
is being stored,


5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,743
and why it's needed.


6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,945
The best way to stay
on top of these details


7
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,682
is to take inventory of
what your app actually stores.


8
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:21,255
To get started, build and
run your app on a device,


9
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:25,626
then exercise all the features
that will store things on disk.


10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,827
Once you've done this,


11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:30,597
it's time to look at what
actually got stored, and where.


12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,867
Use the Devices and Simulators
window in Xcode


13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,472
to extract your app's container
so that we can see what's in it.


14
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,241
Select your device
in the column on the left,


15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,344
then select your app
in the Installed Apps list.


16
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,815
And using the gear icon,
choose Download Container,


17
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,684
and save it on your Mac.


18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,655
In the Finder,


19
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:59,693
Control-click on the xcappdata
file that was downloaded.


20
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,496
Choose Show Package Contents,


21
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:06,733
and go into the App Data folder
and start taking inventory.


22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,001
Look through the directories


23
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,337
to see what got stored
in each one.


24
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,976
For each file, make sure
you can identify what it is,


25
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,811
and why it's being stored.


26
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,013
If you're not sure
why something is there,


27
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,316
you may be able
to get rid of it.


28
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,718
You want to verify that
you're putting the right files


29
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,620
in the appropriate directories,


30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,189
and also consider whether
the file should be included


31
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,792
in iTunes and iCloud backups.


32
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,194
Only you can answer
the first two questions,


33
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,264
since they relate
to your app's functionality.


34
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,132
I'll focus on
the last two questions


35
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,803
and start with
where files should be stored.


36
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,272
iCloud Drive is the best
place to put documents


37
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,810
because they become available
on all of the user's devices.


38
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,946
Because the contents of your
app's folder on iCloud Drive


39
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,516
is visible, it's important that
you only put documents in there


40
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:00,053
that people will recognize
and access directly.


41
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,357
Your app reads and writes
the content locally,


42
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,193
and then the operating
system will automatically upload


43
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,496
those files when
the network is available.


44
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,366
Since multiple devices may
be accessing the files


45
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,501
in iCloud Drive
at the same time,


46
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,636
you do need to use
file coordination


47
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,505
to avoid any conflicts.


48
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,407
So be sure to read
the documentation


49
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,242
for more details.


50
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,645
For locally stored files,
the Documents directory


51
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,348
is available
in your app's container.


52
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,683
Like with iCloud Drive,


53
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,153
you should only store
user-visible documents here.


54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,390
Once you have verified
that your Documents directory


55
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,359
only contains files
that should be exposed,


56
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,061
the Files app can show them


57
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,664
in the On My iPhone
or On My iPad location.


58
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,734
To do this, your app
should support Open in Place


59
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,737
and indicate that
file sharing is enabled,


60
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,775
both of which are configured
in your Info.plist file.


61
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,611
In addition to seeing
their files in the Files app,


62
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,280
people can find
their files in Spotlight,


63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,450
and on iPad, drag and drop them
to other apps.


64
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,386
Another great
benefit of exposing


65
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,587
your Documents directory


66
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:11,525
is that people will see their
files in the Storage Settings UI


67
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,227
and can individually
remove items.


68
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,130
This makes it much easier
to manage disk space,


69
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,665
and will reduce the likelihood


70
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,069
that your entire app is deleted
when space is low.


71
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,272
But remember, the only
things that should be going


72
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,940
into the Documents directory


73
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,810
are files that will make sense
to people using your app.


74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,646
The critical question
you should ask is,


75
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,882
"Should my users
be able to see this file?"


76
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,585
If the answer is yes,
then that's fine.


77
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,487
But if the answer is no,


78
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,489
move it out of
the Documents directory


79
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,992
and into one
of the following locations.


80
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,828
The Application Support
directory


81
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,396
is a good place to store files


82
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,298
that might be in your
Documents directory


83
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,000
but that shouldn't
be seen by users.


84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,736
For example,
a database that your app needs


85
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,372
but that the user would
never open manually.


86
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,075
You can store files
at the top level,


87
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,610
or you can create directories


88
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,279
if that helps
keep things organized.


89
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,782
The directory is
completely under your control,


90
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,917
and it's persistent.


91
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,954
The contents are included
in backups by default,


92
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,522
but you can opt files out 


93
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,257
if they don't need
to be backed up.


94
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,594
And finally, the disk space used


95
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,362
in the Application Support
directory


96
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,132
is reported in
the Storage Settings UI


97
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,702
under your app's
Documents & Data total.


98
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,904
The next location
available to your app


99
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,606
is the Caches directory.


100
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,007
You can store files here


101
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,877
that can be discarded
if space is low.


102
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,745
This is a good location
for any content


103
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,815
that can be
re-downloaded when needed.


104
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,517
The contents of
the Caches directory


105
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,986
is not included in backups.


106
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,688
When a device
is low on disk space,


107
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,691
iOS can help by clearing caches.


108
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,661
Files will never be removed
from your caches directory


109
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,096
if your app is running,


110
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,865
and the operating system
will start by clearing caches


111
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,535
for apps that haven't
been used in a while.


112
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,871
As a bonus to you,
files in your caches directory


113
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,107
are not reported
as part of your app's


114
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,475
Documents & Data total.


115
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,110
Although they are included


116
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,679
in the overall space
taken up by apps.


117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,550
And finally, you can put
files that you won't need


118
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,187
for any extended period of time
in the Temporary directory.


119
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,923
Even though the operating
system will periodically


120
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,592
remove these files
when your app is not running,


121
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,662
it's best to remove them
when you're done with them.


122
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,331
Like the Caches directory,


123
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,500
the Temporary directory
is not backed up


124
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,636
and is not reported in your
app's Documents & Data total.


125
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,739
These are all
the common locations


126
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,341
that your app
can store files in.


127
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,977
Use iCloud Drive
and the Documents directory


128
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,913
for files that should be
accessible in the Files app,


129
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,448
while application support,


130
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,717
caches,
and temporary directories


131
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,220
are all for use
by your app privately.


132
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,488
Be sure to review
where you're storing things


133
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,691
and use the right directory.


134
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,061
Lastly, a couple
best practice tips.


135
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,730
If you have files
that don't need to be included


136
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,932
in iTunes or iCloud backups,


137
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,468
use the NSFileManager APIs


138
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,872
to set the
"IsExcludedFromBackupKey".


139
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,442
You also want to
be resilient to files


140
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,311
that might be restored from
an older version of your app.


141
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,015
For example, if you had
a 32-bit version of your app


142
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,517
and its files were backed up,


143
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,254
then for a 64-bit version
of your app,


144
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,689
those older files
might get restored


145
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,259
and you need to be able
to handle that situation.


146
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,195
It's best to use a versioning
scheme on your files


147
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,597
so that you can provide
robust compatibility


148
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,800
across multiple versions
of your app.


149
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,070
And be sure that you're only
storing files in one location.


150
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,372
For example,


151
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,241
if you put files into
your local Documents directory,


152
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,077
don't duplicate
those in iCloud Drive.


153
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,813
Choose one place
and stick to it.


154
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,081
For user documents,


155
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,751
I suggest preferring
a cloud storage location


156
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,619
unless you have
a specific reason


157
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,622
to store files only
local to a device.


158
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,295
And finally, some new
volume capacity details


159
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,397
are available in iOS 11


160
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,565
to help in knowing
if it's a good time


161
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,068
for your app to take up
more disk space.


162
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,671
The first key,


163
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,840
Available Capacity
For Important Usage,


164
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,710
indicates the amount of space
that can be made available


165
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,413
for things that the user
has explicitly requested


166
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,248
in your app's UI.


167
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,751
For example, if they have
chosen to download a video


168
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,120
or a new level in a game.


169
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,923
If the space you need is
greater than what's available,


170
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,958
you should let them
know that their request


171
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,661
cannot be fulfilled.


172
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,962
The second key,


173
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,899
Available Capacity
For Opportunistic Usage,


174
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,001
indicates the amount
of space available


175
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,603
for things that
the user is likely to want,


176
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,606
but hasn't explicitly requested.


177
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,475
This could be something
like the next episode


178
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,111
in a series of videos
that they are watching,


179
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,280
or recently updated
documents on a server


180
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,982
that they might
be likely to open.


181
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,351
For these types of files,


182
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,420
you might store them initially
in the Caches directory


183
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,589
until they are actually used,


184
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,957
at which point
you could move them


185
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,127
to the Application Support
or Documents directory.


186
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,996
After taking inventory


187
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,998
and identifying what your app
stored,


188
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,368
if you found something
that wasn't in the right place,


189
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,537
then update your code to put it
in the appropriate directory.


190
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,007
And don't forget to add
any necessary migration code


191
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,677
to move the files
from one place to another.


192
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,711
If you don't do this,


193
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,248
you might inadvertently
leave abandoned files behind.


194
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,217
By cleaning up
your on-disk storage,


195
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,219
you can open up your
Documents directory


196
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,553
to people in the Files app


197
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,523
and they can be even more
productive with your app.


198
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,258
