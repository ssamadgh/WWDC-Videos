00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,021
At Apple, changing the world and

173
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,890
making it a better place is what

174
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,459
it's all about for us.

175
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,127
We aim to put the customer at

176
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,597
the center of everything that we

177
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,031
do.

178
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,500
That's why, together with you,

179
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,102
the developer community, we're

180
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:00,472
working hard to provide new and

181
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:02,240
better experiences for our

182
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,843
customers to help them live a

183
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:05,677
better day.

184
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:08,180
And these experiences of course
are expressed through our four

185
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,517
amazing platforms.

186
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:15,687
Today is all about software, and

187
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,122
we've got some very exciting

188
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,091
updates across all four

189
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,693
platforms.

190
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:24,730
We're going to get started with

191
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,564
iOS.

192
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,965
IOS embodies our philosophy of

193
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,233
putting the customer at the
center of everything that we

194
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:31,670
design.

195
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,473
Every year, we deliver a major

196
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,409
iOS update that brings awesome

197
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,345
new features that will impact

198
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,047
the world.

199
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:43,415
To tell you all about what we
had planned for this year, I'd

200
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:46,918
like to introduce Craig

201
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:47,819
Frederique [phonetic].

202
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:48,487
Craig.

[ Applause ]

204
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,492
>> Hey, good morning.
[ Applause ]

205
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,596
All right.

206
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,834
The next release of iOS is, you
guessed it, iOS 12.

207
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,407
Now, our customers, of course,

208
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,043
are going to receive iOS 12 as a

209
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,311
free software update.

210
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,480
Now, it's easy to forget now,

211
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,516
but iOS pioneered this approach

212
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,817
of helping you get more out of

213
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,752
the device you already own

214
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,254
through free updates.

215
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,121
And some of those updates have

216
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,323
been really quite profound.

217
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,125
Like the App Store, giving us a

218
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,127
whole new way to discover and

219
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,362
download apps.

220
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:31,930
It itself was delivered via

221
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,799
software update, as were the

222
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,634
folders we used to organize

223
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,702
those apps.

224
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,103
And can you imagine living

225
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:41,039
without Find My iPhone or

226
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,874
iMessage with its end-to-end

227
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,810
securely encrypted messaging.
Or the revolution in iPad

228
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,381
productivity with Slide Over,

229
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,617
Split View, and Drag and Drop,

230
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,853
or AR, changing the way we

231
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,455
interact with the world around

232
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,690
us, all delivered via software

233
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,491
updates.
And of course we want to get

234
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,294
these improvements to as many of

235
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,229
our customers as possible.

236
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,331
IOS 11 supports devices that

237
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,833
were introduced as far back as

238
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,670
2013, like the iPhone 5S.

239
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,605
And we just love the way

240
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:15,907
customers race to update to our

241
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,109
newest releases.

242
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,244
In fact, half of our customers

243
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:22,414
upgraded to iOS 11 in just seven

244
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:22,981
weeks.

245
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,516
It's incredible.

246
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:28,420
[ Applause ]

247
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,723
Now as we stand here today, 81

248
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:33,759

249
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,727
active iOS devices are running

250
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,429
our latest release.

251
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,431
And now, when you look at the

252
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:42,334
competition, well it's hard to
say they really have a software

253
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:44,536
update model.

254
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:49,174
[ Applause ]

255
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,576
So iOS has the fastest adoption

256
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,278
of any operating system, but

257
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,447
what's much more important to us

258
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,282
is customer satisfaction, and

259
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,717
we're thrilled to report that

260
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,753
customer sat for iOS 11 is at 95

261
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:02,487
percent.
[ Applause ]

262
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,427
Now, delivering all of these

263
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,062
features across such a wide

264
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,497
range of devices will

265
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,366
maintaining high performance is

266
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,967
a challenge we take really

267
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:19,504
seriously, and so for iOS 12, we

268
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,540
are doubling down on

269
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,408
performance.

270
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:30,448
We're working top to bottom

271
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,384
making improvements, to make

272
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,919
your device faster and more

273
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,954
responsive, and because we want

274
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,389
these changes to be available to

275
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,324
the full range of our customers,

276
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,993
iOS 12 will be available on all

277
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,529
the same devices as iOS 11.

[ Applause ]

279
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,302
This is the largest base ever

280
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,138
supported by an Apple release,

281
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,539
and we're focusing our efforts

282
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,075
especially on the oldest

283
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:58,210
devices.

284
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,345
And while it's still early days,

285
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:01,947
we're really pleased with some

286
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,315
of the results we're seeing.

287
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,282
And so I'd like to share some

288
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:05,116
with you.

289
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:06,451
And I'm going to use an example

290
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,919
of a popular phone from a few

291
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,687
years ago.

292
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,889
This is the iPhone 6Plus.

293
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,058
Now on that device, iOS 12

294
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:13,925
delivers a number of

295
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,060
improvements across common

296
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,161
operations.

297
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:17,829
You'll see that apps launch up

298
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,698
to 40 percent faster.

299
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,233
The keyboard can come up up to

300
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,934
50 percent faster, and you can

301
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:25,203
slide to take a photo at up to

302
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:27,505
70 percent faster.

[ Applause ]

304
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,180
Now our deepest focus this year
is optimizing the system when

305
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:38,583
it's under load, and that's
where you need performance the

306
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,853
most and where iOS 12 really
shines.

307
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:44,823
Now, we've put iOS 12 through

308
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,958
our stress test, and we saw in

309
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,860
those conditions Share Sheet

310
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,096
coming up twice as fast and apps

311
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,732
launching twice as fast.

312
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,901
These are big, big improvements.

313
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,502
Now this took changes-- thank

314
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:58,370
you very much.

315
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,639
This took improvements in many,

316
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,940
many places in the system, and I

317
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,308
want to highlight just one.
And it starts with the silicon.

318
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,411
You know, our tight

319
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:08,947
collaboration with our chip team

320
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,016
has enabled us to optimize iOS

321
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,884
across the full range of our A

322
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,653
series silicon.

323
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,155
Now CPUs traditionally respond

324
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,456
to increased demand for

325
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,825
performance by slowly ramping up

326
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,460
their clock speed.

327
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,062
Well now on IOS 12, we're much

328
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:24,930
smarter.
When we detect that you need a

329
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:27,799
burst of performance, like when

330
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,634
you begin scrolling or launching

331
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,103
an app, we ramp up processor
performance instantly to its

332
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:36,074
highest states, delivering high
performance and to ramp it down

333
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,945
just as fast to preserve battery

334
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:40,845
life.

335
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,180
Now, these are just some of the
improvements that are coming to

336
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,951
not just our older devices, but

337
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,054
the full range of devices, and

338
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,722
that's a quick update on

339
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:51,523
performance.

Now if this is all we'd done in

341
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,398
iOS 12, I think it would be a

342
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,067
great release, but we've done

343
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,968
more.

344
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,069
Much more.

345
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,236
And we have a lot to cover

346
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:08,139
today, and it starts with

347
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,274
augmented reality.

348
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,041
Yeah. [applause and cheering]

349
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:15,347
Now AR is transformational
technology.

350
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,316
By bringing experiences into the

351
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,086
real world, it enables all kinds

352
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,487
of new experiences, changing the

353
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,589
way we have fun and the way we

354
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,258
work, and in iOS 12, we wanted

355
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,660
to make an easy way to
experience AR across the system,

356
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,064
and to do that, we got together

357
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,666
with some of the greatest minds

358
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,036
in 3D at Pixar, and together we
created a new file format for

359
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,206
AR.

360
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,341
It's called USDZ, and it's a

361
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,844
compact, single-file format

362
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,013
that's optimized for sharing

363
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,481
while retaining great 3D

364
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,283
graphics and even animations.

365
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:55,053
Now, you can use USDZ across the

366
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,155
system from the files app, to

367
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,057
Safari, even sharing them over

368
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,859
messages and mail, and what's

369
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,494
great is you can place these 3D

370
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,896
objects into the real world.
It's something that's like AR

371
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,665
quick look.

372
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,367
It's really awesome.

373
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,836
Now, we want all kinds of

374
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,338
creatives to be able to create

375
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,507
content for AR, and so we're

376
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,541
working with the leading

377
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,310
companies for 3D tools and 3D
libraries to bring their support

378
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,048
for USDZ.

379
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,117
Now one company that's been all

380
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:29,554
in on USDZ and ARKit is Adobe,

381
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,722
and to tell you about what

382
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,956
they're up to, I'd like to

383
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,892
invite Abhay Parasnis, their

384
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,027
CTO, to the stage.

385
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,495
Abhay.

386
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:41,032
[ Applause ]

387
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:41,866
>> Thanks Craig.

388
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,804
It's great to be here this morn.

389
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,006
So at Adobe we believe augmented

390
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,941
reality is an incredibly

391
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,043
important technology.

392
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,746
And with ARKit, Apple is by far

393
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,648
the most powerful platform for

394
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,349
AR.

395
00:16:58,349 --> 00:16:59,818
So earlier Craig talked about
USDZ format.

396
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,754
It's actually a pretty big deal.

397
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:05,857
There is now a way to deliver AR

398
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,293
experiences across the entire

399
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,327
iOS experience.

400
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:13,264
And so today we are actually

401
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:15,332
announcing that we are going to

402
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,602
bring native USDZ support to

403
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,471
Adobe's Creative Cloud.

404
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,374
[ Applause ]

405
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:26,077
With Creative Cloud, designers

406
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,046
and developers will now be able

407
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,648
to use familiar apps, apps that
they know and love, like

408
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,852
Photoshop or Dimension, to

409
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,421
create amazing AR content and

410
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,556
bring it easily via USDZ.

411
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:41,493
And of course, we are not going

412
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,894
to stop there.

413
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,329
We are going to bring the power

414
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,164
of immersive design to Creative

415
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,700
Cloud with a new set of services

416
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,702
and applications including a

417
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,071
brand-new iOS application that's

418
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,306
going to let all of you design

419
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,042
amazing AR experiences quickly.
So, you will be able to bring in

420
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:04,149
images, videos, text, any object

421
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,518
from Creative Cloud directly

422
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,354
into a native AR environment.

423
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,656
In fact, for the first time with

424
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:14,058
Creative Cloud and iOS, you will

425
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,361
have a what you see is what you

426
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,863
get editing in AR.

427
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,031
It's pretty cool.

428
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,503
So, come join this afternoon

429
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,704
State of the Union where we're

430
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:28,206
able to give you a sneak peak of

431
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,607
some of these new immersive

432
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,876
design tools for the first time.

433
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,311
Thanks. Back to you Craig.

434
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:35,647
[applause]

435
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,315
>> Thank you, Abhay.

436
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,518
[applause] Now a critical part

437
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,787
of enabling AR is accurate

438
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,722
measurement, and fortunately the

439
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,925
precise calibration of sensors

440
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,027
in iOS devices and our tight

441
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,995
hardware software integration
mean that we do this really

442
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,032
well, and we want to enable
everyone to take advantage of

443
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,068
this capability.

444
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:59,837
So we're introducing a new app,

445
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,306
and it's called Measure.

446
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,441
It makes it really easy to

447
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,143
measure objects, detect

448
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,344
rectangles and get their

449
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,146
dimensions, and measure lines

450
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,814
along surfaces, and I'd like to

451
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,848
show it to you now.
[applause] Now, in looking for

452
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,289
something to measure, I ended up

453
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,726
digging through the attic and

454
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:24,896
came upon my old suitcase from
my traveling days in college.

455
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,268
A lot of memories in here.

456
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,370
Now I'm actually in the Measure
app, and you see I can easily

457
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:37,408
measure along this suitcase by

458
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:41,713
just tapping and dragging out a

459
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,115
line, like that, and check that

460
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:44,983
out.

461
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,718
It's a measurement.

462
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,021
[applause] Now, what's really

463
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,856
cool is I can extend these

464
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:55,059
measurements so I can just tap,

465
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,128
drag along another edge just

466
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,931
like that, and even take it into

467
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:03,668
full 3D by dragging down to the
bottom like that.

468
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,504
Isn't that cool?
[ Applause ]

469
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,310
Now I mentioned that we could

470
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,312
automatically detect rectangles

471
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,680
and show you dimensions of

472
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,547
objects.

473
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,316
So I have a photo here actually.

474
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,684
It's one my mom always wanted me

475
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,520
to travel with of me as a baby,

476
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,157
and so, you see, what I can do

477
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,759
with Measure is it automatically

478
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,127
detects the dimensions of that

479
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:29,927
photo.

480
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,031
I can just tap and get, oh,

481
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,399
yeah, a cute little baby, wasn't

482
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,199
I?

483
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,767
And you can get measurements

484
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,467
just like that.

485
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,535
It's really fantastic.

486
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:41,539
[ Applause ]

487
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,075
Now, I'd like to turn now to

488
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,411
USDZ and its support throughout

489
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,312
the system.
You know, you can experience

490
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,481
USDZ in so many places, and one
of those places is news.

491
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,484
Now here's an article.

492
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:54,519
We're all accustomed to seeing

493
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,220
images in news articles.

494
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,689
But check this out.

495
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,524
Here you see a USDZ asset.
It can just tap on this little

496
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:03,494
3D control and jump right in and

497
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:04,228
experience it.

498
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,129
You can see the amazing
animations that are possible,

499
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:07,832
and of course it's fully

500
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,233
interactive.
So I can zoom in and pan.

501
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,039
Isn't that amazing?

502
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,545
[applause] Now USDZ is also

503
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,646
great in the web.
So here I am at the Fender

504
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:24,449
website and actually let you

505
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,817
configure your guitar with the

506
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,151
kind of finish and pickguard

507
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:27,985
that you want.
So I can select a configuration

508
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,389
option here, and then I can see

509
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,857
the guitar I've configured.

510
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,325
So I'm just going to tap in.

511
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:36,260
Of course I can see the guitar

512
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,862
here, but wouldn't it be cool if

513
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,430
I could see it in the real world

514
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,632
in its real size?

515
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,400
Well, there it is.

516
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,234
Check that out.
[applause] I think I'm going to

517
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:51,709
capture that for posterity.

518
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,745
And that's a quick look at USDZ
and Measure in iOS 12.

519
00:21:57,448 --> 00:22:00,118
Next-- thank you.

520
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:02,720
[applause] Next, I'd like to

521
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,789
talk about the key technology

522
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,557
behind these augmented reality

523
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,227
experiences, and that's ARKit.

524
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,129
ARKit opens up the world of AR
to hundreds of millions of

525
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,999
users, making it the world's

526
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,836
largest AR platform by far.

527
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:20,805
And we're on a relentless pace

528
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:22,640
of advancement with AR, and that

529
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,778
continues today with ARKit 2.

530
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:31,516
Yes. ARKit 2 delivers advances

531
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,651
with improved face tracking,

532
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,486
more realistic rendering, and

533
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:38,156
support for 3D object detection
and persistence, which enables

534
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:42,093
launching into AR experiences

535
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,528
associated with a particular

536
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,130
object or a physical space, like

537
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,565
starting a game built around a

538
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,400
physical toy or having a

539
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,835
physical classroom serve as the

540
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:52,603
foundation for a lesson that was

541
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,372
authored in AR.

542
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,574
But probably best is the support

543
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:59,110
for shared experiences.
Now this delivers true,

544
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:03,681
multiuser augmented reality.

545
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:04,949
You and the people around you

546
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:06,417
will be able to see your own
perspective on a common virtual

547
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:09,287
environment.

548
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,488
And to help all you developers

549
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,790
get started, we created this

550
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,492
sample app written in Swift that

551
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:16,327
you'll all be getting today.

552
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:18,362
Now, check out how both players

553
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,431
and even a third observer can

554
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:21,666
all experience the same

555
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,000
environment in real time.

556
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,502
It's really fun.

557
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:29,273
[ Applause ]

558
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:31,542
Now, we've also brought in a

559
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,244
select few developers into our

560
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,412
labs over the last couple of

561
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,747
weeks to work with ARKit, and

562
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:37,582
they love it.

563
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,051
Now, one of them is Lego.
And what they've done is so fun,

564
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,522
you just need to see it.
So I'm pleased to invite Martin

565
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,326
Sanders, director of innovation

566
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,727
of Lego, to the stage to give

567
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:51,395
you a live demonstration.

568
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:52,230
Martin.

569
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,531
>> Craig, thank you very much.

00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:57,134
[ Applause ]

571
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:58,970
Creating and playing with

572
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,172
physical Lego sets brings great

573
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:03,341
joy to millions of children and
Lego fans all over the world.

574
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:09,180
And now, with ARKit 2, we get to

575
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,348
expand those creative

576
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,316
possibilities like never before

577
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,919
and take things beyond the

578
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,254
physical.
What we try to do is combine

579
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:20,825
physical and digital together to

580
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,126
really open up those creative

581
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,995
play possibilities, because our

582
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,663
Lego sets are really the start

583
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:26,731
point for all of those

584
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,999
children's imaginations.

585
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,433
And when we get a chance to

586
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:32,937
really imbed ARKit 2, it takes

587
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:33,804
it to the next level.

588
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:36,974
Let me show you what I mean.
Here we have Assembly Square.

589
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,344
It's one of our Lego creator

590
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:42,480
sets and already has so many

591
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,048
great details it's awesome to

592
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:44,882
play with.

593
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:45,850
But wouldn't it be great if we
could take things even further?

594
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:49,921
Well now with 3D object

595
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,023
detection, we get to recognize
our models and bring them to

596
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:54,525
life.

597
00:24:54,525 --> 00:25:02,033
[ Music ]
And just look at all of those

598
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,169
rich details we can now bring

599
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,039
into our sets, because when we

600
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,840
combine physical and digital

601
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,176
together like this, it really

602
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,644
opens up those creative play

603
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:14,478
possibilities.

604
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:16,948
And there's so much to do here.

605
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,584
Did you see these icons of the

606
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,586
people and objects?

607
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,853
Well they represent missions and

608
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,155
stories that we can explore.

609
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,358
And with a world as rich and as

610
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,826
immersive as this, who wouldn't

611
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:29,860
want to play?
So let's add a character.

612
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,197
How about this little guy here?

613
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:36,033
>> Welcome back, let's go on an

614
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:36,567
adventure.

615

>> Awesome.

Let's go on an adventure.

617
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,870
But going on an adventure with
friends is often way more fun.

618
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:44,208
Anders, why don't you pop in

619
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:44,909
here.

620
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:45,810
>> I'm always up for an
adventure.

00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,146
>> Perfect.

622
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:51,716
Because now with ARKit 2's

623
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,718
multiuser support, we get to

624
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,153
play with up to four friends in

625
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:58,022
the same space.

626
00:25:58,022 --> 00:25:58,990
Let's go ahead and add a few

627
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,824
things from our collection,

628
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,658

>> Okay. I will add a bank over

629
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:04,195
here.

630
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,896
>> Very nice, I like it.

631
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:09,734
How about taking this for a

632
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,404
spin.

633
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,139
Let's just look at all those

634
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,574
rich details you can see on the

635
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:20,611
outside of the building and even

636
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:23,514
on the inside.
Yeah, I think I'm going to add

637
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:26,183
this guy.

638
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:27,218
He's definitely going to keep

639
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,986
the bank safe.

640
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:33,024
Oh look, my character's hungry.
Let's take him over to the

641
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,159
bakery.

642
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,827
Well let's see what they have.

643
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:39,196
Because now with ARKit 2, we get

644
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:40,965
to see inside our physical

645
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:43,034
creations and check out all the

646
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,201
details that were hidden before.

647
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:46,804
We've got a ballerina, a little

648
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:49,373
music session going on, and

649
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:50,675
let's make a bathroom-- oops

650
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,175
sorry.

651
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:52,610
Moving on.

652
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,111
Oh, another play trigger in the

653
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:55,312
bakery.
Let's see what happens when I

654
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,947
click on this.
>> Um, fresh [inaudible].

655
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:00,284
>> Oh, that doesn't look too

656
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,118
good.
>> Anders, I've got a situation.

657
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:04,188
I'm going to need your help over

658
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:04,855
here.

659
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:05,556
>> Yeah, okay, okay.

660
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:06,624
I've got a firetruck.

661
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,558
>> Perfect.

662
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:09,260
You put out those flames while--

663
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,761
oh, oh dear.

664
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:11,595
Somebody's got themselves

665
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,831
trapped on the roof, so I'm
going to use this helicopter to

666
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:19,136
go and pick up these clowns.

667
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:22,006
[music] How are you getting on

668
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:23,407
down there Anders?
>> I'm almost done, almost done.

669
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,912
>> Great. Those guys are safe.

670
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,414
And the flames look like they're

671
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:33,017
almost out.

672
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:36,387
Perfect, we did it.

673
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:38,489
Yeah. What?

674
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:42,426
[ Applause ]

675
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,295
And we've even unlocked a new

676
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,464
item for our collection.
But the fun doesn't need to end

677
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:50,201
there because with ARKit 2, we

678
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,404
get to save our entire world

679
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:56,140
back into our physical set and

680
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,375
pick up where we left off.

681
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,045
[applause] All right.

682
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:01,746
That's awesome.

683
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,814
So much fun.

684
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:05,216
But what makes this truly
amazing is how with just a

685
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:09,420
single Lego creation and ARKit 2

686
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,488
it really opens up those

687
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,556
creative play possibilities.

688
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,391
So look out for more Lego AR

689
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,393
experiences in the App Store

690
00:28:16,393 --> 00:28:17,228
later this year.

691
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,462
Thank you very much everybody.

692
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:22,166
[ Applause ]

693
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,901
>> Isn't that great?

694
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,870
So that's our update on AR and
iOS 12.

695
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,806
Next, I'd like to turn to

696
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:29,840
Photos.
You know, over a trillion photos

697
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,612
are captured on iPhone each

698
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:38,549
year, and Photos is the best way

699
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,051
to relive and share those

700
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,520
moments.

701
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,054
This year we're making photos

702
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,890
even better, and it starts with

703
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,024
Search.
Search has powerful object and

704
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,594
scene recognition.

705
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:51,762
It lets you search for photos

706
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,097
based on things like searching

707
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,699
for cars or dogs or flowers, and

708
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:56,834
that's a great way to explore

709
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,470
your library, but in iOS 12,

710
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,372
Search now starts working for

711
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,208
you even before you start typing

712
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,143
with Search suggestions.

713
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,411
It'll highlight things for you

714
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,814
like key moments and people that

715
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,982
are important to you, places

716
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,150
where you've taken some great

717
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,451
photos and even categories of

718
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,720
photos like hiking and water

719
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,555
sports.

720
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,456
And Search is much more powerful
than ever.

721
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,625
You can search for places by

722
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,493
business name.

723
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:23,661
So you could search for SFMOMA

724
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,130
or even a broad category like

725
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,464
museum.
And, Photos indexes over four

726
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,303
million events by time and

727
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,137
place.
Things like sporting events and

728
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,006
concerts, and so you can search

729
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,708
for them and find photos you

730
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,443
took at those events.

731
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,212
And search is super powerful.

732
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,313
You can now search for multiple

733
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,481
search terms like surfing and

734
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,816
vacation and even get

735
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:47,718
suggestions for additional

736
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:49,186
search terms to help you find
exactly what you're looking for.

737
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,790
And now in iOS 12 we have an all

738
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,858
new tab.

739
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,893
It's called For You.

740
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:58,162
And with For You, you have all

741
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,396
of your memories, so those great

742
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,632
memory movies, but more like

743
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,500
featured photos highlighting a

744
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,636
photo that you took on this day

745
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,104
in past years.

746
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,506
And Effects Suggestions, for

747
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:11,108
instance, suggesting looping a
live photo or applying a new

748
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,646
portrait effect to one of your

749
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,981
portrait photos.

750
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,282
And we even highlight your

751
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,551
shared album activity.

752
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,253
Now when it comes to sharing,

753
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,254
there are many ways you can

754
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,556
share photos, but our focus is

755
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,558
on sharing great photos with the

756
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:29,627
people you care about most, and

757
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,362
that's why this year in For You

758
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,731
we've added Sharing Suggestions.

759
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,633
So imagine you've gone out for a

760
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,867
great dinner with some friends

761
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:38,102
and you took some photos.

762
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,037
Well afterwards in For You,

763
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:41,438
you'll see a suggestion like

764
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:42,907
this to share those photos.
If you tap in, you'll see that

765
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,511
photos is even recommending a

766
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:50,114
set of photos from that set that

767
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,216
you might want to share and
suggest who you might want to

768
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,686
share them with based in part by

769
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,054
the people that appeared in the

770
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:57,955
photos.
And when you share them, they're

771
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,225
shared at full resolution out of
your iCloud photo library and

772
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:05,529
when you're friend receives

773
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,231
them, something really magical

774
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:07,998
happens.

775
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,300
Their phone searches their

776
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,801
libraries for other photos they

777
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,536
took at that event and suggest

778
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,871
that they share them back to

779
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,739
you, so you both can end up with

780
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:16,507
a full set.

781
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:23,047
[ Applause ]

782
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,315
Now this is built around

783
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,482
iMessage so of course it's

784
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:26,850
private, using end-to-end

785
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,786
encryption, and all of those

786
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,888
smarts are done with on-device
machine learning.

787
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,857
So that's your quick update on

788
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:37,127
Photos in iOS 12, and next,

789
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,129
let's turn to Siri.

790
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,965
Now Siri is by far the world's

791
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,233
most used digital assistant with

792
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,169
over 10 billion requests

793
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,237
processed per month, and because

794
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:48,806
Siri works across all your

795
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,874
devices, it's always there to

796
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:51,976
help you through your day

797
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,777
getting things done.

798
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:56,280
Now we all know that Siri works

799
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,315
with many third-party apps for

800
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,317
things like messaging, ride

801
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,586
sharing, and payments.

802
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,921
But we wanted to make Siri able

803
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,923
to do much more for you, and

804
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,491
we're doing that by taking

805
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,326
advantage of the power of apps

806
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,095
with a new feature we call

807
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,529
Shortcuts.

808
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,565
Now with shortcuts any app can

809
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,267
expose quick actions to Siri.

810
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,103
Let's look at some examples.

811
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,738
Now say you have the Tile app

812
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,106
because you're always losing

813
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,307
your keys.

814
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,242
Well, the Tile app can expose

815
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,444
the option to add a shortcut to

816
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:28,245
Siri.

817
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:30,247
And you can assign your own

818
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,216
phrase, such as I lost my keys
would be a good choice, and when

819
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,020
you then say it, Siri will

820
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,856
automatically activate Tile and

821
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,257
show you right in the Siri UI

822
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:42,092
start ringing your Tile just

823
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:42,726
like that.

824
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:43,694
It's really great.
[applause]

825
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:48,132
[ Applause ]

826
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,700
Of course there's so many uses

827
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,634
for this kind of thing.

828
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,302
You could say game time to get

829
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:53,871
your team's schedule from

830
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,206
TeamSnap or help me relax to
kick off a meditation or order

831
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,711
my groceries to order your

832
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:01,578
usual.

833
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:03,881
You know, with millions of apps,

834
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,516
Shortcut enables incredible

835
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,051
possibilities for how you use
Siri.

836
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:10,721
Now, as you know, Siri is more

837
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:11,555
than just a voice.

838
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:12,923
Siri is working all the time in

839
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:14,358
the background to make proactive

840
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,260
suggestions for you even before

841
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,164
you ask, and now with Shortcut,

842
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,032
Siri can do so much more.

843
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,400
So, for instance, let's say you

844
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,035
order a coffee every morning at

845
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:27,104
Phil's before you go to work.

846
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,839
Well now, Siri can suggest right

847
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,340
on your lock screen that you do

848
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,175
that.

849
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,709
You tap on it, and you can place

850
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,179
the order right from there.

851
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,747
Or if when you get to the gym

852
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,115
you use Active to track

853
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:40,150
workouts, well that suggestion

854
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,685
will appear right on your lock
screen.

855
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,454
And this even works when you

856
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,888
pull down into Search.

857
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,323
You'll get great suggestions.

858
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,891
Like say you're running late for

859
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,359
a meeting, well Siri will
suggest you text the meeting

860
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:51,762
organizer.

861
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:54,031
Or when you go to the movie,

862
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,632
suggest that you turn on Do Not

863
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:56,467
Disturb.

864
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,302
That's just being considerate.
And remind you to call grandma

865
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:01,839
on her birthday.

866
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,307
Just tap, and it'll dial the

867
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,808
call for you.

868
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,243
Now, we think we're all going to

869
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:08,679
really enjoy using Shortcuts,

870
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,314
and so we went a step further.
We wanted to let you create your

871
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:15,218
own shortcuts as users, multiple

872
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,587
steps across multiple

873
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,722
applications, and we're doing it

874
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,159
with a new Shortcuts app.

875
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,694
So with the Shortcuts app, you

876
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,829
could do something like create a

877
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,998
shortcut for surf time, and it

878
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,133
could go get you the surf
report, look up the current

879
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,070
weather, get you the ETA to the

880
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,404
beach, and even create a

881
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:35,739
reminder for you to put on

882
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,808
sunscreen when you get there.

883
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,544
Now, it's all done with simple

884
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:43,012
drag and drop steps in the

885
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,749
Shortcuts editor right here.

886
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,116
It's really easy.

887
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:48,452
Now to show you how Shortcuts

888
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:50,087
can streamline your day, I'd
like to invite one of our

889
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,955
leaders from our Siri Shortcuts

890
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:55,092
project, Kim Beverette

891
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,126
[phonetic], to the stage to give

892
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,227
you a live demo.
Kim.

893
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:58,529
>> Hey!

894
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:05,536
[ Applause ]

895
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,504
I'm am so stoked to show you

896
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:08,672
Siri Shortcuts.

897
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,706
To do that, I'm going to walk

898
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:10,841
you through my day.
So imagine it's the morning.

899
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,343
I'm headed to work, and I pick

900
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,612
up my phone, and I see this

901
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,681
suggestion from Phil's Coffee.

902
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,116
Siri has learned that I do this

903
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,717
most mornings, so now I can just

904
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:22,920
tap on the suggestion and I see

905
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,054
all the details I need to

906
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,023
confirm my perfect Mint Monkey

907
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,291
Dough right here on the lock

908
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,592
screen without even going into

909
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:29,359
the app.

910
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,994
So let's get caffeinated.

911
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:33,797
And I'm done.

912
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:36,633
Fast forward a little bit, and

913
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,001
I'm sitting at my desk at my

914
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,236
office and I need to know when
my next meeting is.

915
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:41,705
I'll go to the Up Next widget,

916
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,640
and it looks like I am running a

917
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,841
little late for a rather

918
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,777
important meeting, so I should

919
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,412
probably let someone know.
And it looks like Shortcuts is a

920
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:50,881
few steps ahead of me.

921
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,182
I could call into the meeting,

922
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:53,650
or I could let the organizer

923
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,152
know that I am running late.

924
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,220
I should probably tell Arie
what's up.

925
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,555
That looks like just what I want
to say, sorry Arie, let's send

926
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,393
it.

927
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:05,896
Perfect. I also want to show you

928
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,664
how you can add a shortcut to

929
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:08,498
Siri.

930
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:09,866
So let's take a look at Kayak.

931
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:12,703
I keep all of my travel details

932
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,537
in Kayak.

933
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:15,205
Most important is my post WWDC

934
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,275
relaxation trip to Los Angeles.

935
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,876
You can see I have got my

936
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,712
flight, my hotel, all the

937
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,313
details, everything I need, but

938
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:24,781
what I really want is to be able

939
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,049
to use this and get to this

940
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,851
information with my voice while

941
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,119
I'm on the go.

942
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,221
So, let's head back, and I can

943
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:33,991
just tap add to Siri, record my

944
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,927
custom phrase, travel plans

945
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:40,530
[beep], and I'm done.

946
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,766
So now when I land at the

947
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:44,434
airport and I'm about to get in

948
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:45,969
a cab and I could really use

949
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,838
that hotel address, I can just

950
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,509
say, travel plans.

951
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,344
>> Kayak says your hotel is at

952
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,713
929 South Broadway.

953
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,248
You can check in after 3 p.m.

954
00:36:58,248 --> 00:36:59,750
>> Isn't that cool?

955
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,451
[applause] It's pretty cool.

956
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:06,990
[ Applause ]
So I would love to be on that

957
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:09,393
vacation, but I should, I don't

958
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,028
know, probably finish this demo,
so let's head back to work, and

959
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,231
I can show you how the Shortcut

960
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,666
app can help me with my commute

961
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,068
home.

962
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,803
We start in the Gallery where
there's hundreds of premade

963
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,973
shortcuts that you can download,

964
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:23,907
or we can hop over to the

965
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,409
library, and I've got a bunch of

966
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,510
shortcuts here, but I want to

967
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,711
show you my heading home
shortcut.

968
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:31,214
You can see that it's just

969
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:32,749
really a series of steps.

970
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:34,518
It grabs my location and travel

971
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,553
time, and it sends my ETA to my

972
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,021
roommate.

973
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,523
It sets my HomeKit thermostat to

974
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,991
70 degrees, and it turns on my

975
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:41,958
fan.

976
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,327
And last, it gets directions

977
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,594
home with Apple maps with the

978
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:46,363
best route to avoid traffic.

979
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,632
Now this is already pretty cool,

980
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,801
but I happen to be an NPR News

981
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,402
junkie, so I should probably

982
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:53,737
just add that to my shortcut to

983
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:55,038
save me some trouble on the ride

984
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:55,872
home.

985
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,141
Let's tap search, and there's a

986
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,676
bunch I can add here, but I can

987
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:02,045
just tap Siri suggestions, and

988
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:04,181
there it is, play KQED Radio,

989
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,184
we'll drag this in, drop it, and

990
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,885
we're set.

991
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:10,387
I've already added the shortcut

992
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:12,089
to Siri with a custom phrase,
heading home, so now, whenever I

993
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,793
leave work, I can just say,

994
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:18,161
heading home.

995
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:22,532
>> You will get there in one

996
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:23,333
hour.

997
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,703
I sent a message to Cheryl.

998
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:29,673
Your thermostat is set to 70

999
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:32,976
degrees, and I turned on the

1000
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:33,643
fan.

1001
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:34,077
Playing KQED Radio.

00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,832
It works on iPhone and iPad, and

1009
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:56,800
of course you can run your

1010
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,136
shortcuts from your home pod and

1011
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,170
your Apple Watch.

1012
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,905
And that's your quick update on

1013
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,407
Siri.

1014
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,610
Next, let's talk about apps, and

1015
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,078
to tell you about the latest,

1016
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:09,613
I'm going to hand it off to

1017
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,080
Susan.

1018
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,448
Susan.

1019
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:16,186
[ Applause and Cheering ]

1020
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:18,855
>> Hello. Thanks Craig and it is

1021
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:20,424
so great to be here.

1022
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,058
I'm excited to tell you about

1023
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:23,794
some great updates in some of

1024
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,962
our most popular apps, starting

1025
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:28,331
with one of my favorites, News.

1026
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:32,002
So News is a personalized feed

1027
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,103
where you can see all the

1028
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:34,771
stories you want to read pulled

1029
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:37,641
together from trusted sources.

1030
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,910
And, our top stories are

1031
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,711
handpicked by the Apple News

1032
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:45,749
editorial team to make a great

1033
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:49,085
collection of curated content.

1034
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:51,822
With our new browse tab, you can

1035
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,457
discover new channels and
topics, and we've made it even

1036
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,594
easier to jump to your favorites

1037
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:59,329
because that's why they're your

1038
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:01,465
favorites, right?

1039
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,402
News shines on the iPad.

1040
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,205
We've added a new sidebar, and

1041
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,439
it's a great way to navigate.

1042
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,843
It makes it easy and I fun to

1043
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,544
dig into the areas you're most

1044
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:15,679
interested in.

1045
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,614
So that's news.

1046
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:20,684
Now, we've completely rebuilt

1047
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,352
the Stocks app, and it's got a
beautiful new design.

1048
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,223
Of course, you can still see the

1049
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,958
stock prices and the changes at

1050
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,826
a glance, but we've added spark

1051
00:40:29,826 --> 00:40:32,596
lines, those little charts, that

1052
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,498
show the stock performance

1053
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,365
throughout the day.
And that's cool, but are you

1054
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:39,336
ready?
We are so excited to announce

1055
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,407
we're bringing Apple News to

1056
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:45,542
Stocks.
[ Applause ]

1057
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,281
I'm really excited about that,

1058
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:53,583
and the top stories in Stocks

1059
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,086
features business news, right,
curated by the Apple News

1060
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,188
editors.

1061
00:40:58,188 --> 00:40:59,789
It's pretty terrific.

1062
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,224
You can tap on any stock to get

1063
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:02,526
a more detailed view, so you can
see an interactive chart that

1064
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,363
now includes after hours

1065
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,099
pricing, and you see relevant

1066
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,467
headlines from Apple News

1067
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:13,169
curated by our Apple News
editor.

1068
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:14,638
So it looks great.

1069
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,772
And if you tap on one of those

1070
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:17,807
headlines, you'll see the full

1071
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:20,810
article without leaving the app,

1072
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,280
and of course it's formatted to

1073
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,550
look gorgeous on the iPhone.

1074
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,586
Now, with iOS 12, we're bringing
Stocks to iPad.

1075
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:36,293
[ Applause ]

1076
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,494
It's pretty great, and we take

1077
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,763
advantage of the larger display,

1078
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:40,964
so you can keep your eye on your

1079
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:42,966
stocks on the left while you

1080
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:44,401
browse through your financial

1081
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,235
news.

1082
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:47,304
It's a pretty great experience.

1083
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,372
Next up, Voice Memos.
We've also completely rebuilt

1084
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:53,343
Voice Memos to make it even
easier to use, and we're

1085
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,949
bringing Voice Memos to the iPad

1086
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,483
for the first time.

1087
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:04,688
[ Applause ]

1088
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,189
Importantly, we've also added
iCloud support so your

1089
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,326
recordings stay in sync across

1090
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,160
all your devices.

1091
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,195
We think iPad users are just

1092
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:14,397
going to love this.
And we think that iBooks is the

1093
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,235
best way to discover and

1094
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:21,504
experience eBooks as well as

1095
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:24,441
audio books, and with iOS 12,

1096
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,309
we're introducing an all new

1097
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:29,179
design, and we think the update

1098
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,481
is so great, we're calling it

1099
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:34,584
Apple Books, a new name.
Very dramatic.

1100
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:38,788
We dropped the i.

1101
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,691
[applause] Apple Books has some
great new features.

1102
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:45,261
For example, Reading Now, with a

1103
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,229
preview that makes it really

1104
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:47,964
easy for you to pick reading

1105
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,232
right where you left off.

1106
00:42:49,232 --> 00:42:51,601
And there's so much more,

1107
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:54,004
including a stunning new store

1108
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,939
that makes browsing through your

1109
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:58,208
eBooks and audio books better

1110
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,042
than ever.

1111
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:02,245
We love these updates, and we

1112
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:05,181
think you will too, but we also

1113
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,885
have a smart and safe way to use

1114
00:43:08,885 --> 00:43:09,953
your apps in the car.
I think you know I'm talking

1115
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,690
about Car Play.

1116
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,025
Car Play already supports

1117
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,760
third-party audio and voice

1118
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,328
messaging, you know, voice
calling and messaging apps, you

1119
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:22,098
problem know that.

1120
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:23,533
But what you might not know is

1121
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:26,202
with IOS 12, Car Play will also

1122
00:43:26,202 --> 00:43:27,871
support third-party navigation

1123
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,505
apps.

1124
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:34,844
[ Applause ]

1125
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:36,413
So now you have even more

1126
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,982
choices when you use Car Play.

1127
00:43:38,982 --> 00:43:40,383
That is a really quick look at

1128
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:42,385
some of our app dates, and

1129
00:43:42,385 --> 00:43:43,820
Craig, back to you.

1130
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,487
[applause]

1131
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:45,655
>> Thank you, Susan.

1132
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:52,529
[applause] Well, now I'd like to

1133
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:53,763
take a moment to talk about

1134
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:55,198
something that's on a lot of

1135
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:57,434
people's minds lately.

1136
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,669
You know, iPhone and iPad are
some of the most powerful tools

1137
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:04,174
ever created for learning,

1138
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,143
exploring, and keeping in touch,

1139
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:09,112
but some apps demand more of our

1140
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,647
attention than we might even

1141
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:12,382
realize.

1142
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:14,050
They beg us to use our phone

1143
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,151
when we really should be
occupying ourselves with

1144
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:16,986
something else.

1145
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:18,321
They send us flurries of

1146
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,790
notifications, trying to draw us

1147
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,059
in for fear of missing out.

1148
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,628
And some of us, it's become such

1149
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:26,963
a habit that, you know, we might

1150
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,498
not even recognize just how

1151
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,600
distracted we've become.

1152
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,602
Well, we've thought deeply about

1153
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:34,938
this, and today we're announcing

1154
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,607
a comprehensive set of built-in

1155
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:39,442
features to help you limit

1156
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:42,512
distraction, focus, and

1157
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:44,314
understand how you're spending
your time and balance the many

1158
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,984
things that are important to
you.

1159
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,787
Now it starts with Do Not

1160
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:51,688
Disturb.

1161
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:53,423
There are times of the day, or
times when you just don't want

1162
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,458
to be disturbed, and one of

1163
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,628
those, of course, is at night.

1164
00:44:58,628 --> 00:44:59,562
Sometimes you wake up in the
middle of the night, and you

1165
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:01,531
look at your phone, maybe just

1166
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:02,832
to check the time, and you're

1167
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:03,867
confronted with something like

1168
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,669
this, a barrage of notifications
that spin you up and keep you

1169
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:10,273
from falling back asleep.

1170
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:12,408
And so we're introducing Do Not
Disturb during bedtime where all

1171
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,980
you'll see is this.

1172
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,615
Nothing to get you spun up.
And in the morning, yeah.

1173
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:26,489
[ Applause ]

1174
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:27,957
In the morning when you wake up,

1175
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:29,392
you're gently eased into your

1176
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:30,193
day.

1177
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:31,027
You can tap when you want to

1178
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,095
start confronting those
notifications.

1179
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,066
Now we've all found ourselves in

1180
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:40,937
situations like this.

1181
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,272
[laughter] Now, rest assured, he

1182
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,440
stuck the landing on this one.

1183
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,544
But now Do Not Disturb can help,

1184
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,745
and we made it easier than ever

1185
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,946
to use Do Not Disturb because

1186
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,347
now we have a great new mode

1187
00:45:51,347 --> 00:45:52,482
where when you press in to Do
Not Disturb and Control Center,

1188
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,052
you can set an ending time for

1189
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:56,986
Do Not Disturb for when you
leave a particular location or

1190
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,023
when an event ends on your

1191
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:00,857
calendar.

1192
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:01,658
So I think we're all going to be

1193
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,159
using Do Not Disturb a bunch

1194
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,060
more.

1195
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,029
Now next I want to talk about

1196
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,664
Notifications.

1197
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,533
Now, Notifications help keep us
informed and connected to

1198
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,236
important things that happen

1199
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:15,371
throughout the day, and we'd

1200
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:16,773
like to give you more control

1201
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,075
over how many notifications you
receive, and so we're enabling

1202
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,946
what we call Instant Tuning for

1203
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,047
Notifications right from the

1204
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,415
lock screen.

1205
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,549
You can press in to a

1206
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,051
notification, and from there,

1207
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,319
you can decide to send future

1208
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,221
notifications from that app

1209
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,655
directly to Notifications

1210
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:33,957
Center, bypassing your lock
screen.

1211
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,826
Or turn them off altogether, and

1212
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:37,927
Siri will even help by

1213
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:39,329
suggesting that you turn off

1214
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,030
Notifications for apps that

1215
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,832
you're no longer using.
Now, we also wanted to give you

1216
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,436
help managing large numbers of

1217
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,637
notifications.

1218
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,239
So I'm thrilled to announce that

1219
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,541
we're bringing to iOS support

1220
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,509
for grouped notifications.

1221
00:46:53,509 --> 00:47:01,317
[ Applause ]

1222
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:03,119
Notifications are grouped not

1223
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,622
just by app but also by topic
and thread.

1224
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:08,091
It gives you a great overview of

1225
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:08,958
the notifications you've

1226
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:09,959
received.
You can tap in and look at a

1227
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:12,629
particular group.

1228
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,064
But of course just as important

1229
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:17,100
with a single swipe, you can

1230
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,902
triage a whole group of

1231
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,303
notifications away.

1232
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:22,472
So that's Notifications.

1233
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:26,175
[ Applause ]

1234
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:28,311
Now, in addition to these great

1235
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:30,146
features for helping you limit

1236
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:32,448
distractions, we wanted to go
further, and it's with a feature

1237
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,552
we call screen time.

1238
00:47:36,552 --> 00:47:39,088
Screen time empowers you with

1239
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:41,357
both insight and control over

1240
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,526
how you spend your time, and it

1241
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:46,029
starts with reports.

1242
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,031
Every week, you get a weekly

1243
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,100
activity summary that details

1244
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,336
how you used your iPhone or

1245
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:54,537
iPad.

1246
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,472
You tap in, and you get to view

1247
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:58,942
your full activity report.

1248
00:47:58,942 --> 00:47:59,976
It's really detailed.

1249
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,444
You get deep insight on how much

1250
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:03,012
time you're spending, where

1251
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:04,614
you're spending it, and even how

1252
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:05,982
your use breaks down during the

1253
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:09,085
day or the night.

1254
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:10,787
You get a summary of the time
you're spending in apps, how

1255
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:15,291
much time you're spending, how

1256
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,893
often per hour you're picking up

1257
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,094
your phone and what's drawing

1258
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,964
you in and what apps are sending

1259
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,399
you the most notifications.

1260
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:25,201
Now, equipped with this insight,

1261
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:26,903
you can make decisions about how
much time you want to spend with

1262
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:29,973
your device each day.

1263
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,040
But we know there are people who

1264
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,976
would like a little extra help

1265
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,911
in managing their use of apps,

1266
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,612
and for them we've created App

1267
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:37,647
Limits.

1268
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:39,916
So if in your activity report

1269
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,317
you see an app where you might

1270
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:42,251
want to be spending a little bit

1271
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:44,921
less time, well you can set your
own limit, and then during the

1272
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,425
day, when you're using the app,

1273
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:50,259
you receive a helpful

1274
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:51,527
notification letting you know

1275
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,496
time is almost up.

1276
00:48:53,496 --> 00:49:02,038
[ Applause ]

1277
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:03,039
And once you've reached your

1278
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:04,741
limit, instead of the app,
you'll see this.

1279
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:07,643
It's time to move on.

1280
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:08,511
Now, we'll let you grant

1281
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,679
yourself and extension if you

1282
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,314
want, but we'll give you a
reminder later to move along.

1283
00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:15,618
Now, this is also in sync across

1284
00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:16,919
your iPhone and iPad, so your

1285
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:18,721
limits apply to your total

1286
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:19,622
usage.

1287
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:20,490
And we think this is going to be

1288
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,626
helpful for many people, but

1289
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:26,195
especially for some kids.

1290
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,964
And we know this is something

1291
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,198
that can help families achieve

1292
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:31,200
the right balance for them.

1293
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,435
And of course it starts with

1294
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:33,803
providing your kids with great

1295
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:34,904
information so they get an

1296
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:36,439
activity report of their own,

1297
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:39,308
but as a parent, you get one as

1298
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:43,046
well on your device, and based

1299
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,580
on what you see, you have the

1300
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,484
option of creating allowances.

1301
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:55,024
[ Applause ]

1302
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:56,659
Now you have many options.

1303
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:58,394
One of them is downtime, time
when you want your kids to

1304
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,030
unplug altogether.

1305
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,332
For instance, at bedtime.
And you can also limit your

1306
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:08,671
kids' time in apps by category
or by individual app.

1307
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,208
Now, there's some apps you may

1308
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,643
want to always allow them to

1309
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:14,477
use.

1310
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:15,311
For instance, you may want them

1311
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:16,245
to be able to get at the phone
at all times, so they can

1312
00:50:17,513 --> 00:50:18,314
contact you.

1313
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:19,315
Or you may want to give them

1314
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,350
access to educational apps.

1315
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,586
And you can also limit access to

1316
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:25,922
only movies, apps, and websites

1317
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,791
that you deem age appropriate.

1318
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,560
Now, this works of course across

1319
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,029
their iPhone and iPad, and it's

1320
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,797
uses family sharing, so it's

1321
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:36,799
super easy to set up, and you

1322
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,001
can manage it all remotely from

1323
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:41,170
your parent parental device.

1324
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,373
And so that's are some-- Screen

1325
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:45,875
Time has great features to help

1326
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,543
you better manage your time.

1327
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:56,085
[ Applause ]

1328
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:57,620
Now, next I'd like to talk about

1329
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,422
one of the most important uses

1330
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:01,424
of our devices, and that's

1331
00:51:01,424 --> 00:51:02,325
communication.

1332
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,528
And we'll start with messages.

1333
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:07,497
Messages has given us fun ways

1334
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,332
to express ourselves with emoji

1335
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:12,101
and now Animoji, and one of the

1336
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,237
things that make Animoji so fun

1337
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,705
is how expressive they are, you

1338
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,640
know, from smiles to frowns, to

1339
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,242
nods of the head and blinking of

1340
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,309
the eye.

1341
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,612
Animoji does such an amazing job

1342
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,880
tracking our expressions.

1343
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,581
And this year, we're taking

1344
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:27,450
Animoji to a whole new level,
the breakthrough new technology

1345
00:51:29,685 --> 00:51:33,389
we call Tongue Detection.

1346
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,792
[applause] That's right.

1347
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:38,427
Now, you can make your favorite

1348
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:41,864
Animoji do this.

1349
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,132
We're all going to be sticking

1350
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:44,634
out our tongues to our phones in

1351
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,769
the near future.
Now, we've also, we're also

1352
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:49,505
introducing some great new

1353
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:50,940
Animoji that I think you're all

1354
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,177
going to love, like ghost,

1355
00:51:54,177 --> 00:52:00,516
koala, tiger, and T-Rex.

1356
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:05,254
But we wanted to take Animoji

1357
00:52:05,254 --> 00:52:07,523
even further by making them even

1358
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:09,625
more personal.

1359
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:11,661
So I'm thrilled today to

1360
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,529
announce the arrival of the era

1361
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:17,066
of Memoji.

1362
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:19,468
[applause] That's right.

1363
00:52:19,468 --> 00:52:23,806
With Memoji you can create your

1364
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:26,509
very own personalized Animoji.

1365
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:32,048
[ Applause ]
Now, these Animoji can look like

1366
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:39,589
you or the real you.

1367
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,958
And we've worked hard to build a

1368
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,693
deep set of customization

1369
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,461
options to let our customers
create an incredibly diverse set

1370
00:52:49,365 --> 00:52:50,666
of Memoji.

1371
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,301
It's really incredible what you
can create.

1372
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:55,471
And we've designed a beautiful

1373
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:57,039
new experience to create these

1374
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:58,774
Memoji that makes the process
fun and easy.

1375
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,678
Now, to tell you more about it,
I'd like to invite one of the

1376
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,314
managers of our Messages and

1377
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:07,516
Animoji features, Kelsey

1378
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:09,185

1379
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:09,752

[ Applause and Cheering ]

1382
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,224
Good morning.

1383
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:18,427
I cannot wait to tell you what's

1384
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:19,262
new with Messages.

1385
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,864
Let's get started with Animoji.

1386
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:23,132
First, you need to meet the

1387
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:25,368
newest members of the team.

1388
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,403
We've got a new cat in town, our

1389
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:29,538
tiger.

1390
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:32,775
She's so cute.

1391
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:35,711
And now, my personal favorite,
the koala.

1392
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,418
Just getting excited scrolling

1393
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:43,552
through here.

1394
00:53:43,552 --> 00:53:44,787
They can't all be cute and
cuddly though, so here's our

1395
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,056
T-Rex.

1396
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:53,229
And we've our very own friendly

1397
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,897
little ghost.

1398
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:58,934
So much fun.

1399
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:01,604
And if I swipe right, here's
where I can create my very own

1400
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,207
Memoji.

1401
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:06,876
Let me show you just how easy it

1402
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,044
is.
I recently chopped my hair, so I

1403
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:11,380
want one that matches the new

1404
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,615
me.
So I've selected a skin color,

1405
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,319
and now I'm trying to figure out

1406
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,820
just the right amount of

1407
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,654
freckles.

1408
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:22,091
It's a real Goldilocks scenario.

1409
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:24,393
Yeah, these are just right.

1410
00:54:24,393 --> 00:54:27,797
Okay. Onto the main event.

1411
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,699
There are so many hairstyles to

1412
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,766
choose from.

1413
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:31,901
First, I'm going to grab my
color, and then like I said, I

1414
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:36,539
need to go a little bit shorter.

1415
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,773
All right.

1416
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:41,110
Nope, this is the one.

1417
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,611
Now that I'm all set, I can of
course select my eye color, and

1418
00:54:44,613 --> 00:54:46,182
what's really amazing is as I'm

1419
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,050
making changes, the character up

1420
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,520
above is coming to life.

1421
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,656
There are tons of options for me

1422
00:54:53,656 --> 00:54:54,490
to customize.

1423
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,692
I could add earrings, but what I

1424
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:58,694
really want is a great pair of

1425
00:54:58,694 --> 00:54:59,962
Sunnies, so I'm going to come

1426
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:03,799
over to eyewear and pick out

1427
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:05,735
some frames.

1428
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,269
Maybe not for today.
I think I need two lenses.

1429
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:12,475
These are the ones.

1430
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,743
Now that I have frames, I'm

1431
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,211
going to tint my lenses to make

1432
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,646
a great pair of sunglasses.

1433
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:25,321
[ Applause ]

1434
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,822
Perfect. Okay.

1435
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:27,656
I think I'm all set.

1436
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:30,626
I'll tap done, which saves my

1437
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:32,828
grandly created Memoji right
here into the drawer alongside

1438
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:36,165
the rest of my team.

1439
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:37,933
And that's how simple it is to

1440
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:42,505
create your very own Memoji.

1441
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:49,445
[ Applause ]

1442
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:51,147
Now I have a brand-new feature
to introduce you to.

1443
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:54,216
This wasn't even in Craig's
slides.

1444
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,286
We are bringing fun effects into

1445
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:58,821
the Messages camera.

1446
00:55:58,821 --> 00:55:59,655
Let's take a look.

1447
00:55:59,655 --> 00:56:01,690
I've a message here from my

1448
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,758
partner.
It looks like he's informing me

1449
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,795
that he's bought our dog,

1450
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,597
Ferdinand, yet another tiny dog

1451
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:09,398
hat.

1452
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:10,399
This isn't even the first.
I think this is the perfect

1453
00:56:12,735 --> 00:56:14,437
opportunity for a response with
this new fun camera.

1454
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:17,807
So I'll tap to pull up the
camera, and then I can see this

1455
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,876
little star over here on the

1456
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:22,244
left.

1457
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:24,280
Tapping on that gives me a strip

1458
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,415
with all sorts of new effects.
So I could add things like

1459
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,119
shapes or text.

1460
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,189
But let's check out these
filters.

1461
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:35,591
Ooh. So this is comic book.

1462
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:37,526
It's really fun, but for a

1463
00:56:37,526 --> 00:56:40,062
response about a tiny dog hat, I

1464
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:41,297
think I'm going to go in a

1465
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:44,233
different artistic direction.

1466
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,768
So what I really need to do is

1467
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:47,002
add a sticker from one of my

1468
00:56:47,002 --> 00:56:49,138
favorite sticker packs.

1469

Ferdy looked really excited

1470
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:53,175
about that new dog hat, so I'm

1471
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:56,645
going to put him right here, and

1472
00:56:56,645 --> 00:56:58,681
now we have an all new way for

1473
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,349
you to use Animoji.

1474
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:03,118
I can apply my favorite Animoji

Here's the Memoji I just

1478
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,300
created, but I actually have

1479
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,035
just the one.
It's of me in a very similar red

1480
00:57:22,938 --> 00:57:25,341
hat, which is kind of perfect

1481
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,308
for twinning with my pup.

1482
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:32,681
So I'm going to set up my shot,

1483
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:33,516
snap, and send.

1484
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,118

00:57:56,438 --> 00:57:58,807
Yeah. Facetime is the way that
so many of us connect with the

people in our lives and share

00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,052
are, and of course it's a fun

1498
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:11,854
place just to hang out.
Now this year Facetime is going

1499
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:16,725
to take a big leap forward

1500
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:19,895
because today we're introducing

1501
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:22,464
Group Facetime.

1502
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:28,037
[ Applause ]

1503
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:31,073
Now, you'll be able to facetime

1504
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:34,944
with two people, three people,

1505
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:38,480
actually up to 32 simultaneous

1506
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,481
participants.

1507
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:43,419
[ Applause ]
Now, setting up a group call

1508
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,590
couldn't be easier.

1509
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,591
Just instead of typing one
person's name, you can do many.

1510
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:51,527
You can ring them by tapping

1511
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:53,796
audio or video, but we also

1512
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,130
introduced a great new way

1513
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,432
because Facetime is now
integrated into messages, so you

1514
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,236
can quickly go from a group chat
you have going directly into a

1515
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,674
group Facetime, and members of
the group can join in and drop

1516
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,178
out at any time.
It's really great.

1517
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,380
Would you like to see it?

1518
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,615
[applause] Well let's do a demo.
[applause] Well I think for our

1519
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:19,588
first live demo of group

1520
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:22,124
Facetime, I'm going to contact
the folks back in Cupertino.

1521
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,260
I can just dive in to this

1522
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,262
conversation I have going with

1523
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:28,497
the members of the Facetime
team, and it looks like actually

1524
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,200
they're already on a group

1525
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,936
Facetime call, so I'm just going

1526
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:39,942
to join right in.

1527
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,510
Hey everybody.

1528
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,512
>> Hey Craig.

1529
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:44,613
>> Check it out.
So it's this beautiful Facetime

1530
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,585
UI with these big gorgeous tiles

1531
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,153
right up front where you see
some of the leaders of the

1532
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:53,789
Facetime team, and down at the

1533
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:55,557
bottom there's and area we call
the roster that contains

1534
00:59:57,192 --> 00:59:58,027
everybody else.

1535
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,194
And of course I'm right there in

1536
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:01,130
the lower right-hand corner.

1537
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,197
>> Hey Craig.

1538
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:04,233
Wait, am I on the big screen?

1539
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,701
>> Yes, Lauren, this is not a

1540
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:06,635
test.

1541
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:08,404
You're in front of 6000 of your

1542
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:09,505
biggest new fans.

1543
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:15,411
[ Applause ]

1544
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,613
Now, what you probably notice is
when Lauren spoke, her tile

1545
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,983
automatically got larger to

1546
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:22,718
reflect her prominence in the
conversation.

1547
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:25,487
This is totally automatic.

1548
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:26,789
Hey Roberto, how's it going back

1549
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,357
there in Cupertino?
>> I'd say it's going pretty

1550
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:32,194
well, and Lauren, sorry for

1551
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:34,163
stealing your spotlight.

1552
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,297
>> So this works of course for

1553
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:37,166
people in the roster as well.

1554
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,100
When they speak, they come
forward.

1555
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:39,768
Hey Christopher, you ready to

1556
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:40,602
make your big entrance?

1557
01:00:40,602 --> 01:00:43,172
>> Finally, my moment has come.

1558
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,006
Hello world.

1559
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:49,578
>> Now, well done.

1560
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:51,513
Now you can control this too, so

1561
01:00:51,513 --> 01:00:52,781
I want to bring Woody front and

1562
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:55,050
center, I just double tab.

1563
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,952
There he is.

1564
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,855
Woody, your baby is performing

1565
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:01,323
admirably here.

1566
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:02,157
>> Thanks Craig.

1567
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:03,025
It's exciting to finally be able

1568
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:04,093
to share Group Facetime with
everyone.

1569
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,828
>> It sure is.

1570
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,863
Now, we have not only all of

1571
01:01:07,863 --> 01:01:09,832
this, but we've also brought the

1572
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,600
fun effects to the Facetime

1573
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,434
camera.

1574
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:14,269
I can just tap in, and I have
access to Animoji, filters, and

1575
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,942
all of my sticker packs, and

1576
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,477
everyone else on the call can

1577
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,245
apply them too.

1578
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:26,982
Now this is the future.

1579
01:01:26,982 --> 01:01:27,816
>> Hey, Craig.

1580
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:28,984
Check this out, I'm a comic book

1581
01:01:28,984 --> 01:01:30,385
koala, something I've always

1582
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:31,954
wanted to be.

1583
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:32,788
[laughter]

1584
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:33,655
>> I'm glad you've finally been

1585
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:34,790
able to express that side of
yourself, Roberto.

1586
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:38,327
Hey, Tim, is that you?

1587
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,161
>> Yeah, it's me.

1588
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:40,329
I've signed up to help test

1589
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:40,896
Facetime.

1590
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:41,730
>> All right.

1591
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:49,138
[applause] Well, well thank you,

1592
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:49,838
Tim.

1593
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:51,273
Every little bit counts.

1594
01:01:51,273 --> 01:01:52,674
>> Happy to help, and thanks to

1595
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:54,309
everyone on the Facetime team

1596
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:55,811
for making it a reality.

1597
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:57,946
I can't wait to start using it
every Sunday night to follow the

1598
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:03,018
leadership team.

1599
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:04,052
>> Looking forward to that, Tim.

1600
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:06,288
Of course what I'm really

1601
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:07,689
looking forward to is getting

1602
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,691
Group Facetime to everyone on

1603
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:10,492
iOS 12.

1604
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,027
Thanks guys for a fantastic

1605
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:12,861
call.

1606
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:13,495
We'll see you back in Cupertino.

1607
01:02:13,495 --> 01:02:22,204
[ Applause ]

1608
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:24,072
So that's Group Facetime.

1609
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:26,675
It works on iPhone, iPad, and

1610
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:29,344
Mac, and you can even answer an

1611
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:31,280
audio on your wrist on your

1612
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,148
Apple Watch.

1613
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:35,818
So that's Facetime and Messages,

1614
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,453
and this is iOS 12.
Improved performance, new AR

1615
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,193
experiences, Siri Suggestions,

1616
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,695
Screen Time, Memoji and fun

1617
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:48,630
effects in the Messages camera,

1618
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,132
and Group Facetime.

1619
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:52,167
I hope you like it.

1620
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,168
I'm going to hand it back to

1621
01:02:53,168 --> 01:02:53,669
Tim.
Thank you.

1622
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:58,373
[ Applause ]

1623
01:02:58,373 --> 01:03:00,976
>> Thank you, Craig.

1624
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:03,612
IOS 12 looks fantastic, and we

1625
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:05,280
can't wait for everyone to get

1626
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,015
their hands on it.
Next up, we'd like to talk about

1627
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:10,719
the Apple Watch.

1628
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:14,556
Yeah. [applause] When we began

1629
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:15,824
development of the watch many

1630
01:03:15,824 --> 01:03:17,826
years ago, we had a vision for

1631
01:03:17,826 --> 01:03:20,195
just how impactful and essential

1632
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:22,764
it could become in our lives, so

1633
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:24,967
we worked very hard to create

1634
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,902
something that you would love

1635
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:29,504
and want to wear all the time,

1636
01:03:29,504 --> 01:03:31,773
and customers do love it.

1637
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:33,642
In fact, Apple Watch is number
one in customer satisfaction,

1638
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:39,214
[applause] and not just this
year, but every single year

1639
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:44,286
since we launched in 2015.

1640
01:03:44,286 --> 01:03:46,255
And growth has been off the

1641
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,789
charts.

1642
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:50,359
Apple Watch grew 60 percent last
year.

1643
01:03:51,426 --> 01:03:53,061
We're constantly hearing from

1644
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:55,430
customers about the many ways
that the Apple Watch has changed

1645
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:58,200
their lives.
And I'd like to share just one

1646
01:04:00,602 --> 01:04:04,006
of them with you this morning.

1647
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,708
Mary Dovgen was boating with her

1648
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,911
husband, John, when due to a

1649
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,380
medical condition all of John's

1650
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,448
muscles went completely limp,
and he fell into the ice cold

1651
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:17,019
water.

1652
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,520
With her arms wrapped around

1653
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,223
John to keep him from drowning,

1654
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:23,992
Mary could not reach her phone

1655
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:26,428
to call for help.
But with her Apple Watch, she

1656
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,400
was able to call Siri, or to use

1657
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,636
Siri to call 911, rescuers soon

1658
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:38,507
arrived, and saved John's live.

1659
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:42,644
[ Applause ]
As Mary told us, if it wasn't

1660
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,983
for my Apple Watch, he really

1661
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:50,719
would not be here today.

1662
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:52,187
This is just one of the many

1663
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:53,722
stories that we've heard about

1664
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,457
about how Apple Watch is
impacting people's lives.

1665
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,428
They range from getting people
to be more active, to helping

1666
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,499
users live a healthier life, or
even to alerting users to an

1667
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:08,003
elevated heart rate.

1668
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:10,439
Apple Watch brings such amazing
capabilities right to the wrist,

1669
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,710
and of course at the heart of

1670
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,546
this is watchOS.

1671
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,181
We're excited to introduce

1672
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,017
watchOS 5 today, which brings

1673
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:23,952
even more ways for you to stay

1674
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:26,888
active and connected, and I'd
like to hand it off to Kevin

1675
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,492
Lynch to tell you all about it.

1676
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:31,493
Kevin.
[ Applause ]

1677
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,266
>> Good morning.

1678
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:39,267
You know, stories like that,
about how Apple Watch is

1679
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:41,570
supporting people around the

1680
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,106
world in even extreme situations

1681
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,440
like Mary and John's but also in

1682
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,942
their daily lives is really

1683
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:48,176
super motivating to us as a

1684
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:48,977
team.

1685
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,512
And there are things you do

1686
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:51,980
every day that shape your life.

1687
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,416
And Apple Watch has two

1688
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,550
[inaudible] working to help you

1689
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,052
support those activities every

1690
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:58,653
day.
First, staying active to

1691
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:00,922
increase your well-being and

1692
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:02,290
health and second being

1693
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,358
connected to the people and the

1694
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:04,493
information that you care most
about, and we're moving watchOS

1695
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:08,363
in both of these areas.

1696
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:09,464
Let's start with health and

1697
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:10,599
fitness.

1698
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:11,533
Now much of the power in the
health and fitness features that

1699
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:14,603
we've put in Watch are really

1700
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:15,904
empowered by the investment we

1701
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:18,006
do to make sure the data you see

1702
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:19,207
is accurate.

1703
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:20,342
The data from our custom-built

1704
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,176
heart rate sensor,

1705
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:23,412
Accelerometer, Gyro, GPS, are

1706
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,080
all thoroughly validated.

1707
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,715
In fact, from our fitness lab,

1708
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:28,383
we've studied over six terabytes
of data where 12,000 study

1709
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:32,421
participants logged over 90,000
hours of sessions.

1710
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:35,023
And they actually burned 2.3

1711
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:37,192
million calories doing this.

1712
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:38,427
We believe this is the largest

1713
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,861
biometric data collection of its
kind.

1714
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:42,898
And we take this information and

1715
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,032
we work to integrate this

1716
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:45,033
seamlessly with the user
experience so when you raise

1717
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,602
your wrist and you look at your

1718
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:49,104
activity rings, the information

1719
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:50,138
is not only accurate, but it's

1720
01:06:50,138 --> 01:06:51,773
also meaningful to you.

1721
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:52,841
We really love hearing about
your focus on closing these

1722
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:55,510
rings.

1723
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,578
And we really enable this
through a number of ways in

1724
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:58,847
Apple Watch.

1725
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,582
First, of course, we do daily
coaching so you can see what

1726
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,385
your goals are for the day.

1727
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:04,753
We also support celebrations

1728
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:06,922
when you achieve your goals, and

1729
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:07,823
we have special edition

1730
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,424
challenges like the most recent

1731
01:07:09,424 --> 01:07:11,526
birthday challenge that we did.

1732
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,195
And on a monthly basis, we do

1733
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,129
monthly goals that are
personalized to you.

1734
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,566
And of course the activity app
also supports activity sharing,

1735
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,302
which has become one of the most

1736
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,937
popular features of the activity
app.

1737
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:25,006
Many of you love the excitement
of good old-fashioned

1738
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,476
competition though, so in

1739
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,377
watchOS 5, you can challenge any

1740
01:07:29,377 --> 01:07:30,912
of your activity-sharing friends

1741
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,280
to a seven-day competition

1742
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,115
whenever you would like.
And if they accept, you each try

1743
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,985
to win the week by closing your

1744
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:38,286
rings and earning points.

1745
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:39,287
You earn one point for each
percent of a ring that you

1746
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:40,922
close.

1747
01:07:40,922 --> 01:07:42,057
And while you're in the middle
of a competition, your progress

1748
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,127
notifications are updated, do

1749
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,428
not only show you the progress

1750
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:47,562
your friends are making, but

1751
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:48,763
also where you stand in the

1752
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:50,031
competition.

1753
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:52,868
And when you win, you receive a

1754
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:53,902
new award.

1755
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:55,003
We're really excited about this

1756
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:55,804
edition, and if you're

1757
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:56,605
competition, it gives you a

1758
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:57,939
whole new way to enjoy the

1759
01:07:57,939 --> 01:07:59,841
activity app.

1760
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:01,476
Now when you're doing

1761
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:06,915
[applause]-- now when you do

1762
01:08:06,915 --> 01:08:07,749
want to go do a workout, there's

1763
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:08,817
a lot of workout types you can

1764
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:10,585
choose from, and they all have

1765
01:08:10,585 --> 01:08:11,820
custom algorithms to measure

1766
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,388
things like calorie burn, pace,
distance, elevation gain, and

1767
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,024
when you're swimming, it even

1768
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:17,359
counts laps and detects which

1769
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,693
swim strokes you're using.

1770
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,328
And with Gym Kit, your metrics

1771
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:21,696
are in sync with your favorite
gym equipment.

1772
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:23,498
And we're really excited to
bring more enhancements to

1773
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:27,002
workouts in watchOS 5, starting

1774
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,236
with a new workout type for
yoga.

1775
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:30,304
Now this works primarily from

1776
01:08:30,305 --> 01:08:32,674
your heart rate, and we

1777
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:34,209
calibrate this to your fitness

1778
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:35,544
through the rest of your day, so

1779
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,478
now you can more accurately

1780
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:38,046
track those yoga sessions

1781
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:39,614
including those intense Vinyasa
sessions.

1782
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:42,651
New we've also added a new

1783
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:44,519
workout type for hiking.

1784
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:45,954
This takes into account pace and
heart rate and elevation gain so

1785
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:48,790
you can more accurately get

1786
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,025
exercise credit while you're

1787
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:51,725
hiking on steep terrain or

1788
01:08:51,725 --> 01:08:53,327
really long stages.

1789
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:56,698
And Apple watch has become a

1790
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,533
really great running companion

1791
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,801
especially now that we've added

1792
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,670
GPS and cellular and music

1793
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,504
streaming.

1794
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:03,405
And we're making this an even

1795
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:04,805
better experience now for

1796
01:09:04,805 --> 01:09:06,640
training runs and races.

1797
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,575
In addition to current and

1798
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:08,977
average pace, you now have the

1799
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:10,378
option to keep track of your

1800
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:12,046
rolling mile pace, which is how

1801
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:13,380
fast you ran the immediately

1802
01:09:13,381 --> 01:09:14,916
preceding mile.

1803
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:16,117
You can also now set a custom

1804
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:17,819
pace alert, so your Apple watch

1805
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:18,753
will tap you when you're above
or below the pace that you've

1806
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:20,855
set.
And finally, runners will now

1807
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:23,691
get cadence so you can see your

1808
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:24,793
current steps per minute.

1809
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:26,293
We're really excited for runners

1810
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:28,630
to try these out.

1811
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,464
Now--

1812
01:09:29,464 --> 01:09:34,402
[ Applause ]

1813
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:35,470
Now there are sometimes when you

1814
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,538
forget to start a workout on
watch, but you've started

1815
01:09:37,404 --> 01:09:39,139
working out, and to solve this

1816
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,775
now, we're adding automatic
workout detection.

1817
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:48,016
[ Applause ]

1818
01:09:48,015 --> 01:09:48,949
So your Apple Watch will now

1819
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,085
offer to start tracking your

1820
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,219
workout if it senses that you're

1821
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:52,020
beginning one.

1822
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,288
And even if you press start
sometime after you began working

1823
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,591
out, you'll get retroactive

1824
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:57,692
credit for the workouts that you

1825
01:09:57,692 --> 01:09:59,494
did.

1826
01:09:59,494 --> 01:10:03,632
[ Applause ]

1827
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:04,933
And [inaudible] wills support

1828
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:06,301
all these great workouts on

1829
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:08,303
Apple Watch.
Now when you reduce the

1830
01:10:09,137 --> 01:10:10,238
intensity of your movement or

1831
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:11,840
your heart rate decreases but

1832
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,041
you forget to end your workout,

1833
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,609
of course Watch will also detect

1834
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:16,511
that and suggest that you stop.

1835
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:21,916
[ Applause ]

1836
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:23,351
So, all these new features,
activity competitions, the new

1837
01:10:25,053 --> 01:10:26,855
yoga and hiking workout, new

1838
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,456
features for runners and

1839
01:10:28,456 --> 01:10:30,292
automatic workout detection are

1840
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,593
all enabling you to more
accurately track your workouts

1841
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:35,864
and stay motivated while you do.
Now let's talk about being

1842
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:38,500
connected.

1843
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,634
Apple Watch enables you to

1844
01:10:39,634 --> 01:10:41,269
remain in the moment while also

1845
01:10:41,269 --> 01:10:42,771
easily connected to the people
and information that you care

1846
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:44,706
about.

1847
01:10:44,706 --> 01:10:45,940
And the introduction of cellular
made this even better.

1848
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,443
You can stay connected even when

1849
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:49,611
you're going out for an evening,

1850
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:51,012
running some errands, or even

1851
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:52,580
going for a swim.

1852
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,748
Or, stay in touch when your

1853
01:10:53,748 --> 01:10:54,716
phone might not be easily

1854
01:10:54,716 --> 01:10:56,351
available to you.
And staying connected with

1855
01:10:57,385 --> 01:10:58,586
people you love is something

1856
01:10:58,586 --> 01:10:59,788
that our customers love about
Apple Watch.

1857
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:01,890
You can easily make or receive a

1858
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,191
phone call, and you can hear the
emotion and tone at the other

1859
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:06,261
end of the voice as you talk in

1860
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:07,429
real time.

1861
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,830
Or you can use Messages to have

1862
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,865
impromptu, short conversations

1863
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:11,966
with loved ones in a Message

threat.

1865
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,969
In watchOS 5, you'll have an

1866
01:11:14,969 --> 01:11:16,538
entirely new way to communicate
on your watch.

1867
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:18,973
That's real-time voice but with

1868
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:20,241
a spontaneity of short

1869
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:21,343
messaging.

>> Did you steal my chips?

1871
01:11:29,284 --> 01:11:30,318
>> Maybe.

1872
01:11:30,318 --> 01:11:35,290
>> I cannot wait until you go to

1873
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,124
college.

1874
01:11:36,124 --> 01:11:38,526
>> Introducing Walkie Talkie.

1875
01:11:38,526 --> 01:11:44,065
[ Applause ]

1876
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:45,233
This is a new app by Apple

1877
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:46,067
Watch.

1878
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:47,335
It's fun, easy way to talk with

1879
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:48,436
friends and family.

1880
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:49,304
Let's take a look at how it

1881
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:50,538
works.
First you choose who you'd like

1882
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:52,874
to enable Walkie Talkie with,
and it suggests some people that

1883
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:55,643
you often communicate with, so

1884
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:56,511
you could easily add them.

1885
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:58,346
Now the first time that you do
this, your friend will receive a

1886
01:11:59,614 --> 01:12:01,049
one-time request to allow a

1887
01:12:01,049 --> 01:12:02,217
walkie talkie connection with

1888
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,017
you.

1889
01:12:03,017 --> 01:12:04,185
If they accept, then you can

1890
01:12:04,185 --> 01:12:05,186
speak to each other with walkie
talkie whenever you like.

1891
01:12:06,187 --> 01:12:08,423
And to do this, you just press

1892
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:10,492
to talk, and then your friend

1893
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:11,893
can hear your voice just like a

1894
01:12:11,893 --> 01:12:12,694
walkie talkie.

1895
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,829
And they're going to feel a
[inaudible] beep beep sound

1896
01:12:15,663 --> 01:12:16,531
right before your voice comes

1897
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:17,332
out.

1898
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:18,433
And this new watch-to-watch

1899
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:19,901
connection works over cellular

1900
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:21,569
or Wi-Fi, and it has really high

1901
01:12:21,569 --> 01:12:22,337
audio quality.

1902
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:23,338
And it's a lot of fun.
We can't wait for you to try

1903
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:25,006
this out.

1904
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:26,508
That's walkie talkie.
[ Applause ]

1905
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,314
Now last year we introduced a

1906
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:34,749
Siri watch face, which presents
the right information to you at

1907
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,851
the right time.

1908
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:38,253
And Siri does this using machine

1909
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:39,154
learning, so it's going to get

1910
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:40,021
better at predicting your
actions over time by combining

1911
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:43,558
inputs like the time of day,

1912
01:12:43,558 --> 01:12:44,893
your location, your daily

1913
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:46,294
routines, or which apps you use

1914
01:12:46,294 --> 01:12:46,995
when.

1915
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:47,862
We're making some great

1916
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:49,464
enhancements to the Siri watch

1917
01:12:49,464 --> 01:12:50,865
face now.

1918
01:12:50,865 --> 01:12:52,066
First, we're adding new content.

1919
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,468
So now you can get live sports

1920
01:12:53,468 --> 01:12:55,036
scores, you can get commute time

1921
01:12:55,036 --> 01:12:56,771
home or to work, or you can see

1922
01:12:56,771 --> 01:12:58,106
your heart rate, for example,

1923
01:12:58,106 --> 01:12:59,707
after a workout or your resting

1924
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:01,443
heart rate.

1925
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,044
And we're also adding Siri

1926
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:03,878
Shortcuts.

1927
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:04,712
So the shortcuts you saw coming

1928
01:13:04,712 --> 01:13:06,714
to iOS 12 are also going to be
available in watchOS.

1929
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:09,350
So in addition to getting

1930
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:10,885
relevant information, you'll

1931
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:12,520
also receive predicted shortcuts

1932
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,489
right on the Siri watch face.
So in a wrist raise, you'll be

1933
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:17,559
able to directly do things like

1934
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,093
turn on your leaving home scene

1935
01:13:19,093 --> 01:13:20,929
or start an outdoor walk or play

1936
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,397
your favorite morning playlist.

1937
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,566
And these shortcuts app based on

1938
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,767
whether you typically do those

1939
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:27,435
actions at those times.

1940
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:28,837
So super easy now to just tap

1941
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,238
and do those actions.

1942
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:32,574
Also for the first time, you can
now use third party apps on the

1943
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:36,044
Siri watch face.
So now you can see both relevant

1944
01:13:37,445 --> 01:13:38,680
content and shortcuts from your

1945
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,514
favorite apps.

1946
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:46,120
[ Applause ]

1947
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,188
So if you always go running with

1948
01:13:47,188 --> 01:13:49,057
Nike Plus Run Club at a certain

1949
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:49,991
time or you're logging your

1950
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:51,493
meals with LoseIt or you use

1951
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:52,527
City Mapware to find your

1952
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:54,028
commute home, you just raise

1953
01:13:54,028 --> 01:13:55,563
your wrist and tap, it's that

1954
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:56,397
easy.

1955
01:13:56,397 --> 01:13:57,999
So new content, support for

1956
01:13:57,999 --> 01:14:00,068
Shortcuts, and third-party apps

1957
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,503
making for an even more powerful
Siri watch phase.

1958
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,407
Now currently to talk to Siri

1959
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:07,208
you raise your wrist and you
say, hey Siri.

1960
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:09,711
And when you think about this,

1961
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:10,845
it's quite a strong signal when

1962
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,113
you raise your wrist and talk to

1963
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:12,947
your watch.

1964
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:13,781
It's kind of like when someone's

1965
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:14,916
standing right in front of you,

1966
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:15,750
you don't need to say hey

1967
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,651
because you have their attention

1968
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:18,453
already, so we're bringing this

1969
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:20,622
same social cue to Siri on the

1970
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,124
watch so you no longer need to
say, hey Siri.

1971
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:26,027
You just raise your wrist and

1972
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:27,629
talk to Siri.

1973
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:32,967
[applause] Now we're also
bringing a number of

1974
01:14:33,801 --> 01:14:35,303
improvements to Notifications,
which are now more actionable

1975
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,872
and interactive.

1976
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:38,907
So, for example, with this

1977
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,508
notification from Quantis, you

1978
01:14:40,508 --> 01:14:41,543
can check in and share your

1979
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:42,844
flight details right from the

1980
01:14:42,844 --> 01:14:44,512
notification.

1981
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:45,547
After you finish a ride with

1982
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,248
Dee, you can scroll down.

1983
01:14:47,248 --> 01:14:48,650
You can rate your ride and pay

1984
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,251
with Apple Pay right there in

1985
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:51,853
the notification.

1986
01:14:51,853 --> 01:14:53,087
And with this one from Yelp that

1987
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,355
your table is ready, if you need
a bit more time, you can extend

1988
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:56,925
the reservation out a bit just

1989
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,126
by tapping here.

1990
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,561
So super easy now to interact
right in place inside

1991
01:15:00,461 --> 01:15:02,664
Notifications.
We've also improved our Message

1992
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:05,166
notification.

1993
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,167
Today if someone sends you a

1994
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,802
weblink, you aren't able to view
it on your list.

1995
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,072
With watchOS 5, we've integrated

1996
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:12,206
WebKit, so now you have the

1997
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:14,075
ability to view web content and

1998
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:16,344
mail or messages.

1999
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,212
You can even tap on that link,

2000
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:20,548
yes, to easily view things like
menus here.

2001
01:15:21,382 --> 01:15:23,518
And while we think full browsing

2002
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:24,385
doesn't make sense on your

2003
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:25,753
wrist, there are times you get
content.

2004
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:27,422
You'd like to see it right in

2005
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,256
the moment, and now you'll be

2006
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:29,857
able to do that and watch OS 5.

2007
01:15:29,857 --> 01:15:30,725
And the contents can be

2008
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:32,126
formatted for the small screen,

2009
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,227
and the where reader made is

2010
01:15:33,227 --> 01:15:34,295
available, it uses that on the

2011
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:35,063
watch.

2012
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,498
So WebKit on watchOS.
[ Applause ]

2013
01:15:44,038 --> 01:15:45,073
Now with watchOS 4, we

2014
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,541
introduced an entirely new way

2015
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,642
to listen to music while you're

2016
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:48,476
on the go.

2017
01:15:48,476 --> 01:15:50,078
You can stream 48 million songs

2018
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,079
on your wrist with Apple, or you
can listen to automatically

2019
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:54,649
synced and created play lists.

2020
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:56,985
And now with watchOS 5, we're
giving you even more to listen

2021
01:15:57,919 --> 01:15:58,519
to.

2022
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:03,391
[ Applause ]
That's right.

2023
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:05,760
The Apple podcast app is coming

2024
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,261
to Apple Watch.

2025
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:08,463
Upcoming episodes from
subscribed podcasts will be

2026
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:10,865
automatically synced to your

2027
01:16:10,865 --> 01:16:12,233
watch, so you can get them right

2028
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:14,602
there, or you can just ask Siri

2029
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:15,937
to stream a podcast for you, and

2030
01:16:15,937 --> 01:16:17,705
it'll start playing and playback

2031
01:16:17,705 --> 01:16:19,307
resume across all your devices

2032
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:20,575
so you can continue just where

2033
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:21,676
you left off.

2034
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,978
So that's Podcast.

2035
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:24,846
Now those are the great new
features coming in watchOS 5.

2036
01:16:26,347 --> 01:16:28,016
So stay connected with people

2037
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:28,916
and information that you care

2038
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:30,151
most about, interactive

2039
01:16:30,151 --> 01:16:32,520
notifications, web content, new

2040
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,554
content and shortcuts in the

2041
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:35,223
Siri face, podcasts and of

2042
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,958
course walkie talkie.

2043
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:37,825
Now we'd like to show you this

2044
01:16:37,825 --> 01:16:39,594
stuff live in action, and we

2045
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:40,595
thought we'd increase the

2046
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:41,896
challenge a bit in our live demo
here today to keep it

2047
01:16:43,464 --> 01:16:44,298
interesting.

2048
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:45,967
So, Jules, who helps lead our

2049
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:47,935
fitness experiences, is actually

2050
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:48,770
going to do the demo while

2051
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,504
biking.
[ Applause ]

2052
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,478
So Jules has expertise in

2053
01:16:57,478 --> 01:16:58,546
coaching, and she knows how to

2054
01:16:58,546 --> 01:16:59,380
move and demonstrate and

2055
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,448
motivate all at the same time.

2056
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:01,783
Take it away, Jules.

2057
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:02,583
>> Thank you, Kevin.
I've got some great stuff to

2058
01:17:03,651 --> 01:17:04,585
show you that I think you're

2059
01:17:04,585 --> 01:17:06,254
really going to love, and the

2060
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:07,722
bonus is, I get to work on

2061
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:09,891
closing my rings while I do it.

2062
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,993
So, first, I'm super excited to

2063
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:13,628
show you how easy it is to start
a workout with GymKit.

2064
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:18,666
I just tap to connect and accept

2065
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,234
on the watch, and now I can

2066
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:22,603
control and start the workout

2067
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:23,871
right here from the console on

2068
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:24,939
the bike.

2069
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:26,874
All of my data between the watch
and the bike is in sync, and all

2070
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:29,477
of my workout metrics are

2071
01:17:29,477 --> 01:17:30,878
accurate.

2072
01:17:30,878 --> 01:17:32,013
Now, I wouldn't typically be

2073
01:17:32,013 --> 01:17:33,247
trying to demo things for you

2074
01:17:33,247 --> 01:17:34,315
and sneak in a workout at the
same time, but I want to show

2075
01:17:35,883 --> 01:17:37,385
you activity competitions.

2076
01:17:37,385 --> 01:17:39,520
And to do that, I need to keep

2077
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,254
moving.
This morning I got this

2078
01:17:41,522 --> 01:17:44,559
notification, and it says, your

2079
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,160
competition with Jay is down to

2080
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,628
the last day, and it's a close

2081
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:48,463
one.

2082
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:49,330
Have you got what it takes to

2083
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:50,098
win?

2084
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,299
Have I got what it takes?

2085
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,500
You bet I do.

2086
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,137
[ Applause ]

2087
01:17:56,137 --> 01:17:57,705
But if I scroll down, I can see

2088
01:17:57,705 --> 01:17:58,873
that Jay has moved ahead of me

2089
01:17:58,873 --> 01:18:00,007
by a couple of points, and

2090
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:01,042
that's not okay because this

2091
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:02,210
thing ends tonight.

2092
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,678
So, I think I'm going to add a

2093
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:05,313
little resistance to this

2094
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,081
workout here and work to earn as

2095
01:18:07,081 --> 01:18:08,483
many points as possible and move

2096
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,550
ahead of Jay by the time this

2097
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:10,818
demo is done.

2098
01:18:10,818 --> 01:18:13,888
I can simply tap here and send

2099
01:18:13,888 --> 01:18:15,323
him a little smack talk to let

2100
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,324
him know I'm coming for him.
Let me show you interactive

2101
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:21,529
notifications because I have a

2102
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:22,764
dinner reservation tonight that

2103
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:23,998
I made through Yelp.
If all goes well here, I'm going

2104
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:26,434
to go out with my girlfriends

2105
01:18:26,434 --> 01:18:27,502
from work to celebrate.

2106
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,570
And because we all know that Jay
is going to lose this

2107
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:31,606
competition, maybe I should

2108
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:33,674
invite him along so it can be

2109
01:18:33,674 --> 01:18:35,109
his treat.

2110
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:37,178
Now I can simply add to the
number of guests and confirm

2111
01:18:38,746 --> 01:18:40,181
right here in the app without
ever having to open it.

2112
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:43,484
It's that simple.

2113
01:18:43,484 --> 01:18:47,421
[ Applause ]

2114
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:50,358
Now in watchOS 5, notifications

2115
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,492
from apps are smartly grouped

2116
01:18:51,492 --> 01:18:52,727
together, and here are a couple

2117
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:53,761
messages from my friend

2118
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:55,129
Catherine.
We're trying to get to a yoga

2119
01:18:56,097 --> 01:18:57,265
retreat this summer, and it

2120
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,033
looks like she sent me a link.

2121
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:01,936
Now, I can tap it here and see
if she's found somewhere great

2122
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:04,872
for us to go.

2123
01:19:04,872 --> 01:19:06,874
Oh yeah, this looks beautiful.
I'm already in, but I can

2124
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,911
continue to scroll through the

2125
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,612
site and maybe read a little bit

2126
01:19:11,612 --> 01:19:13,481
more about the retreat, even

2127
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:14,482
check the dates to make sure

2128
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:15,316
that they work.

2129
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:16,584
And I can do all that right here

2130
01:19:16,584 --> 01:19:19,453
from my wrist.

2131
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:24,192
[ Applause ]

2132
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,493
Let me show you the enhancements

2133
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:26,594
that we've made to the new Siri

2134
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:27,395
watch face.

2135
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:29,030
At the top here, you see the
workout that I'm in right now,

2136
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:32,166
and when I'm ready to get back

2137
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,734
to it, I can just tap.

2138
01:19:33,734 --> 01:19:35,469
Next up is Glow Baby, because

2139
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:36,704
it's about this time each day

2140
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:38,139
that I check the app to see if

2141
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:39,140
my husband has logged our

2142
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,975
one-year-old's nap.

2143
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:42,109
Oh, good job, baby.

2144
01:19:42,109 --> 01:19:44,045
You slept two hours, and you

2145
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:45,313
parents know that good naps

2146
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,447
equal good nights, so I'm

2147
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:48,282
looking forward to that.

2148
01:19:48,282 --> 01:19:50,785
AR. As I scroll through my day,

2149
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:52,620
I can see my next meeting.

2150
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,255
I can see traffic and directions

2151
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:55,489
to places that I'm going later
today.

2152
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,526
Here's that dinner that Siri

2153
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,294
found in my calendar, and

2154
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:01,829
waiting for me at the end of my

2155
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:03,731
day is a shortcut to my evening

2156
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:05,366
meditation or ten percent

2157
01:20:05,366 --> 01:20:07,935
happier, nice.

2158
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,170
Now, I want to check back in on

2159
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,838
this competition, but I thought

2160
01:20:10,838 --> 01:20:12,106
it might be a good idea to get a

2161
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:13,474
little moral support from my

2162
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:14,909
number one fan.
And you heard Kevin say how

2163
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,778
walkie talkie is so great for

2164
01:20:17,778 --> 01:20:18,813
staying in touch with close

2165
01:20:18,813 --> 01:20:19,747
friends and family.

2166
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:21,482
So I set my daughter up with

2167
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,284
walkie talkie so that she can

2168
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:24,452
help demo what it's like to

2169
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,187
receive one and maybe give me a

2170
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:27,088
little bit of love up here.

2171
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:28,689
Oh, there she is.

2172
01:20:28,689 --> 01:20:34,896
>> Mommy, I see you on TV.
>> Isn't that fun?

2173
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:38,733
How am I doing?

2174
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,735
>> So good.
I know you'll beat Uncle Jay,

2175
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:46,173
#mommyforthewin.

2176
01:20:46,173 --> 01:20:47,308
>> Thanks Peach.

2177
01:20:47,308 --> 01:20:48,542
I love you.

2178
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:56,083
[ Applause ]
And that's how walkie talkie

2179
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:58,486
works.

2180
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,621
AR. The time is now to check in

2181
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:02,590
on this competition and see if I

2182
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,292
have done enough to pull ahead.

2183
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,193
I'm going to tap into activity

2184
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:07,662
and swipe over to see the score.

2185
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:09,497
Oh, yes.

2186
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:15,703
[ Applause ]

2187
01:21:15,703 --> 01:21:17,805
Sorry Jay, but the day is still

2188
01:21:17,805 --> 01:21:18,639
young.

2189
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:19,473
Thanks everybody, and back to

2190
01:21:19,473 --> 01:21:20,508
you, Kevin.

2191
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:27,348
[ Applause ]

2192
01:21:27,348 --> 01:21:29,050
>> Way to go, Jules.

2193
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,551
So in watchOS 5 we've enabled

2194
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:32,219
even deeper integration on the

2195
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:34,021
watch for apps, enabling them to

2196
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:35,122
work right in the moment.

2197
01:21:35,122 --> 01:21:37,291
And apps can include interactive

2198
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:39,160
controls within notifications so

2199
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,661
you can quickly do more without

2200
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:42,196
even opening an app like extend

2201
01:21:42,196 --> 01:21:43,464
your parking with Pay by Phone.

2202
01:21:43,464 --> 01:21:45,366
And with Shortcuts, there's also

2203
01:21:45,366 --> 01:21:46,334
new opportunities for

2204
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,835
third-party apps to appear on

2205
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:48,970
Apple Watch right on the watch

2206
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:49,804
face.

2207
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:50,871
You can tap on a shortcut on the

2208
01:21:50,871 --> 01:21:52,873
Siri face to order coffee, rent
a bike, or pick up where you

2209
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,676
left off in a workout.

2210
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:56,777
You can even use your custom

2211
01:21:56,777 --> 01:21:58,479
Siri commands that you created

2212
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:00,014
on your phone to speak on your

2213
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:01,449
watch.
And for native apps building

2214
01:22:02,483 --> 01:22:03,884
rich experiences, we've improved

2215
01:22:03,884 --> 01:22:05,186
the workout API for greater

2216
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,988
performance, and we've added the

2217
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:08,656
ability for third-party apps to

2218
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:10,491
play background audio.

2219
01:22:10,491 --> 01:22:15,429
[ Applause ]

2220
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:16,664
This enables you to easily sync

2221
01:22:16,664 --> 01:22:17,832
things, of course, like audio

2222
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,533
books, favorite playlists,

2223
01:22:19,533 --> 01:22:21,369
guided meditations right to your
watch and to be able to play

2224
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,505
continuously in the background.

2225
01:22:24,505 --> 01:22:25,706
Now there are so many other

2226
01:22:25,706 --> 01:22:26,974
features coming into watchOS

2227
01:22:26,974 --> 01:22:28,142
including things like the

2228
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:29,377
ability to customize the button

2229
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:30,611
arrangement in your control
center, or you can add an air

2230
01:22:32,346 --> 01:22:33,414
quality complication to your

2231
01:22:33,414 --> 01:22:34,849
watch face, but one really

2232
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,550
exciting one is student ID

2233
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:37,418
cards.
You're going to have the ability

2234
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,554
to add your student ID card to

2235
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:42,490
wallet on your iPhone and Apple

2236
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,991
Watch.

2237
01:22:43,991 --> 01:22:45,426
And this works by simply holding

2238
01:22:45,426 --> 01:22:47,028
your watch near a meter anywhere

2239
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:48,062
you can use your student ID

2240
01:22:48,062 --> 01:22:49,997
cards on and off campus.

2241
01:22:49,997 --> 01:22:51,432
You can get access to places
like your dorm or the library or

2242
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:54,735
events on campus.

2243
01:22:54,735 --> 01:22:56,003
You can even pay for things like

2244
01:22:56,003 --> 01:22:57,705
snacks or laundry or dinners,

2245
01:22:57,705 --> 01:22:59,106
and this works with your watch

2246
01:22:59,106 --> 01:23:00,641
or your phone, and it will be

2247
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:02,676
available this fall starting

2248
01:23:02,676 --> 01:23:04,045
with these universities and will

2249
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,579
expand to more campuses over

2250
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:06,480
time.

2251
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:13,154
[ Applause ]

2252
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,789
Now this is also Pride month,
and we're really excited to

2253
01:23:15,756 --> 01:23:17,224
introduce an all-new Pride

2254
01:23:17,224 --> 01:23:18,492
education watch band.

2255
01:23:18,492 --> 01:23:25,032
[ Applause ]

2256
01:23:25,032 --> 01:23:25,866
And we didn't stop there.

2257
01:23:25,866 --> 01:23:27,134
We made a beautiful new face

2258
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:28,335
that matches perfectly with the

2259
01:23:28,335 --> 01:23:29,503
band.

2260
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:34,341
[ Applause ]

2261
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:35,843
And the face and the band are
available today.

2262
01:23:36,777 --> 01:23:37,945
And if you'd like to use the new

2263
01:23:37,945 --> 01:23:39,280
watch face, you can choose to

2264
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,347
add it from the watch face

2265
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:42,149
gallery starting at noon today.

2266
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:43,651
That's just some of what's
coming in watchOS 5.

2267
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:45,953
Thank you very much.

2268
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:46,454
Back to Tim.

>> Thanks Kevin.

2270
01:23:51,158 --> 01:23:52,927
Thank you, Kevin.
WatchOS just keeps getting

2271
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:56,497
better and better, and we're

2272
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:58,165
excited for you to try all of

2273
01:23:58,165 --> 01:23:59,533
these great new features to help

2274
01:23:59,533 --> 01:24:00,601
you stay more active and
connected.

2275
01:24:01,869 --> 01:24:05,306
Next up is Apple TV.

2276
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:10,010
Last September, we introduced

2277
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:12,446
Apple TV 4K, and our customers

2278
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:13,514
love it.

2279
01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:14,949
Since its introduction, the
Apple TV business has grown an

2280
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:19,920
incredible 50 percent.

2281
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,622
Today, we've got some great new

2282
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:24,024
enhancements to Apple TV 4K and

2283
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:25,593
tvOS, and we think you're going
to love them.

2284
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:29,697
So I'd like to invite Apple TV

2285
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,699
lead designer, Jen Fuls
[phonetic] to the stage to tell

2286
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,601
you all about it.

2287
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:34,435
Jen. [applause]

2288
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:36,504
>> Thanks Tim.
[ Applause ]

2289
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:41,408
Apple TV is built on an

2290
01:24:41,408 --> 01:24:43,878
incredible platform, tvOS.
And tvOS is built specifically

2291
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,182
for the living room, to make it

2292
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:50,184
easy to enjoy your favorite TV

2293
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:53,554
shows, movies, apps, and games.

2294
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:54,922
Now as Tim mentioned, last
September, we introduced Apple

2295
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,527
TV 4K with the goal of bringing

2296
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,228
the highest quality cinematic

2297
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:04,298
experience right to your home.

2298
01:25:04,298 --> 01:25:06,967
It offers both 4K and high

2299
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:08,969
dynamic range, including support

2300
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:11,972
for HDR 10 and Dolby Vision.

2301
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:14,041
Time said, the new Apple TV is a

2302
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:16,577
high fidelity powerhouse.

2303
01:25:16,577 --> 01:25:18,445
And to ensure you can enjoy this
beautiful experience with as

2304
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:23,584
much content as possible, iTunes

2305
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:26,120
offers the largest collection of

2306
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,489
4K HDR movies.

[ Applause ]

2308
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:33,761

previously purchased movies to

01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:37,865
4K HDR for free on all available
titles.

2311
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:42,169
There are also, thank you, there

2312
01:25:42,169 --> 01:25:44,838
are also many 4K and HDR TV

2313
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:46,407
shows available from popular

2314
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,475
services like Amazon Prime video

2315
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,678
and Netflix.
And we know what makes for an

2316
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:54,348
amazing cinematic experience is

2317
01:25:54,348 --> 01:25:56,750
not just great picture quality.

2318
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,752
It's also incredible sound.

2319
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:02,423
So Apple TV 4K is bringing you
the latest in audio technology,

2320
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:08,996
Dolby Atmos.

2321
01:26:10,464 --> 01:26:15,569
[ Applause ]

2322
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:18,272
With Atmos, you get room-filling
sound.

2323
01:26:19,106 --> 01:26:20,641
The perfect complement to the

2324
01:26:20,641 --> 01:26:23,711
stunning visuals of Apple TV 4K.

2325
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,347
Now what makes Atmos so special
is that unlike a traditional

2326
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:28,916
surround sound setup, where

2327
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:30,317
sound is assigned to channels

2328
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:32,853
like the left or the right,

2329
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:34,655
Dolby Atmos has the ability to

2330
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:37,224
completely immerse you.

2331
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:38,759
Atmos moves sound in

2332
01:26:38,759 --> 01:26:40,361
three-dimensional space,

2333
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,829
creating an experience with

2334
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,998
powerful audio that flows all

2335
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:44,999
around you.

2336
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,667
It puts you right in the center

2337
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:48,402
of the action.

2338
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:50,104
All this with a home theater

2339
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:52,373
setup as simple as a Dolby Atmos
enabled soundbar and an Apple TV

2340
01:26:54,608 --> 01:26:55,776
4K.

2341
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:58,545
In fact, Apple TV 4K is the only

2342
01:26:58,545 --> 01:26:59,813
streaming player to be both

2343
01:26:59,813 --> 01:27:01,515
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos

2344
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:02,449
certified.
[ Applause ]

2345
01:27:08,155 --> 01:27:09,857
And this Fall, iTunes will be

2346
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:11,325
bringing you the largest

2347
01:27:11,325 --> 01:27:13,560
collection of Atmos content

2348
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,395
anywhere.

2349
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:17,331
And just like with 4K HDR, your

2350
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:18,666
iTunes libraries will be

2351
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,734
upgraded to include Dolby Atmos

2352
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:23,437
on all supported titles for
free.

2353
01:27:27,608 --> 01:27:28,442
[applause] Now of course these

2354
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:30,210
movies and so much more are

2355
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:33,247
available in the Apple TV app.

2356
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:35,349
The Apple TV app is the center

2357
01:27:35,349 --> 01:27:37,351
of your video experience, a
single place to find and watch

2358
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:40,487
what you love across your

2359
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:41,889
favorite apps.

2360
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,291
It's on Apple TV, iPad and

2361
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,926
iPhone where you can find not

2362
01:27:45,926 --> 01:27:47,494
only On Demand TV shows and
movies but also live content

2363
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,498
including sports.
The Apple TV app now offers a

2364
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:57,137
huge range of live sports.
And we've added live news to

2365
01:27:59,139 --> 01:28:00,808
make it even easier to stay

2366
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,343
current.

2367
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,311
The edition of live sports and

2368
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:05,379
news providers brings the

2369
01:28:05,379 --> 01:28:07,047
coverage of the TV app to over

2370
01:28:07,047 --> 01:28:10,617
100 video channels, giving you a

2371
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:12,653
massive selection of content all

2372
01:28:12,653 --> 01:28:14,288
in one place.
With all this, Apple TV is the

2373
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,559
best box to connect to your TV.

2374
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:20,294
And that's now more true than

2375
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:22,129
ever as more and more cable

2376
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,565
companies fundamentally shift

2377
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,400
how video gets to your TV.

2378
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,935
This typical cable box is

2379
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:31,038
becoming a thing of the past as
these companies embrace

2380
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,208
internet-based delivery.

2381
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,410
And many of them share our

2382
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,645
vision of Apple TV as the one

2383
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:41,115
device for live, On Demand, and
Cloud DVR content.

2384
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:44,551
And we've already started

2385
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:46,053
working with partners around the
world to make this a reality.

2386
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:50,424
In France, we're working with

2387
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:52,226
Canal Plus.

2388
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,627
Almost a third of French

2389
01:28:53,627 --> 01:28:55,095
households subscribe to Canal

2390
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:57,131
services, and their subscribers

2391
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:58,766
can now choose Apple TV to
access more than 100 live

2392
01:29:00,467 --> 01:29:02,803
channels and some of the biggest

2393
01:29:02,803 --> 01:29:04,571
sports including the French Open

2394
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:06,173
in 4K.

2395
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:09,143
In Switzerland, we've partnered

2396
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:10,377
with Salt.

2397
01:29:10,377 --> 01:29:11,879
Salt just launched a new TV
service with more than 300 live

2398
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:16,150
TV channels, and it's available
exclusively on Apple TV.

2399
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,555
And I'm really excited to

2400
01:29:21,555 --> 01:29:22,823
announce that here in the U.S.,

2401
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:24,458
Charter Spectrum will be coming
to Apple TV late this year.

2402
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:32,199
[ Applause ]

2403
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:34,468
That means that up to 50 million

2404
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:35,836
homes will be able to choose

2405
01:29:35,836 --> 01:29:37,971
Apple TV to access all their
live channels and thousands of

2406
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,508
On Demand programs.

2407
01:29:41,508 --> 01:29:43,277
And, they'll be able to use Siri

2408
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:45,512
and the TV app to get access to

2409
01:29:45,512 --> 01:29:47,281
their TV service not only on

2410
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:52,052
Apple TV but on iPhone and iPad

2411
01:29:52,052 --> 01:29:52,820
as well.

2412
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,654
Now with nearly any cable

2413
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,389
subscription, you can get access

2414
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:57,891
to dozens of video channels like
ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many

2415
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:02,830
more, but it used to be really

2416
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,865
painful to set up, having to

2417
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:06,366
authenticate each app

2418
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:07,367
individually.

2419
01:30:07,367 --> 01:30:08,502
I'm sure all of you have seen

2420
01:30:08,502 --> 01:30:09,903
that six-digit code you have to

2421
01:30:09,903 --> 01:30:11,438
go online and type into a web

2422
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:12,272
browser.

2423
01:30:12,272 --> 01:30:14,475
Well, last year we introduced

2424
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:15,909
single sign-on.
Enter your cable credentials

2425
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:20,247
only once, and we unlock all of

2426
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:21,548
the apps your subscription
supports.

2427
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,918
Well now we're making it even

2428
01:30:24,918 --> 01:30:28,522
easier with zero sign-ons.

2429
01:30:28,522 --> 01:30:33,227
[ Applause ]

2430
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:34,895
So now if you're on your TV

2431
01:30:34,895 --> 01:30:36,697
provider's broadband network,

2432
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,866
we'll securely and automatically

2433
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:40,734
unlock all the supported apps

2434
01:30:40,734 --> 01:30:42,603
included with your TV service.

2435
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:43,871
No credentials needed.

2436
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:46,440
It just works.
Charter Spectrum [applause]--

2437
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:51,612
this is really awesome-- and

2438
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,946
Charter Spectrum will be the

2439
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:54,548
first to support zero sign-on

2440
01:30:54,548 --> 01:30:55,482
and we'll be adding more

2441
01:30:55,482 --> 01:30:57,718
providers over time.

2442
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:59,119
We're also giving you even more

2443
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:00,654
options for ways to control your

2444
01:31:00,654 --> 01:31:02,189
Apple TV.

2445
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:03,824
For example, you can get quick
access on your iPhone where

2446
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,027
Apple TV users will get the

2447
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:09,096
Apple TV remote automatically
added to control center.

2448
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:12,866
And, for those that have

2449
01:31:12,866 --> 01:31:14,635
installed home control systems,

2450
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,802
we're working with the leading
providers so that you can use

2451
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:18,805
their remotes to control your

2452
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:21,041
Apple TV, even including support

2453
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:22,276
for Siri.

2454
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:26,413
At Apple, I love working with an

2455
01:31:26,413 --> 01:31:28,448
amazing team designing for a

2456
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,350
product that I enjoy every day

2457
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:32,286
and on the biggest screen in my

2458
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:33,220
home.

2459
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,590
I get to watch all my favorite

2460
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:39,826
movies, TV shows and more.

2461
01:31:39,826 --> 01:31:42,362
Over 40 million songs including

2462
01:31:42,362 --> 01:31:45,866
the best metal on Apple Music.

2463
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:47,968
All of my photos, videos, and

2464
01:31:47,968 --> 01:31:50,871
memories as well as thousands of

2465
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:52,973
apps and games that many of you

2466
01:31:52,973 --> 01:31:54,274
have built.

2467
01:31:54,274 --> 01:31:57,311
And, Apple TV brings some
amazing views right to my living

2468
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,316
room with Aerials.

2469
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:03,650
Now, one of the questions I get

2470
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:05,319
asked the most about Aerials,

2471
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:06,787
especially by my family members

2472
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:08,755
is where is this?

2473
01:32:08,755 --> 01:32:11,091
Well, this ball with just a tap

2474
01:32:11,091 --> 01:32:13,093
of the Siri remote, you'll now
be able to see every Arial

2475
01:32:15,195 --> 01:32:16,496
location.

2476
01:32:16,496 --> 01:32:21,602
[ Applause ]

2477
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,170
And, you can even swipe between

2478
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:25,472
locations so you can see even

2479
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,306
more.

2480
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:29,476
And today, I have an incredible

2481
01:32:29,476 --> 01:32:31,144
new location to share with you.

2482
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:34,414
For the past year, we've been
collaborating closely with an

2483
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:38,185
amazing partner, filming some

2484
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:39,686
stunning footage from around the
world with a very unique vantage

2485
01:32:42,322 --> 01:32:46,927
point, and here it is.

2486
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:48,061
Earth.

2487
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:55,736
[ Applause ]
This is filmed by astronauts

2488
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,172
aboard the International Space

2489
01:32:59,172 --> 01:33:00,107
Station.

2490
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,675
You can see Sicily just off the

2491
01:33:01,675 --> 01:33:03,343
boot of Italy, and check out

2492
01:33:03,343 --> 01:33:04,578
that Mediterranean Sea.

2493
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,480
The blue is just phenomenal.
So here's a fun fact.

2494
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:10,917
The Space Station makes an orbit

2495
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:13,053
every 90 minutes, so that means
they get 16 sunrises and sunsets

2496
01:33:15,889 --> 01:33:16,690
every day.
And with all those sunsets,

2497
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,261
nighttime can be particularly

2498
01:33:21,261 --> 01:33:22,529
stunning the way those urban

2499
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,431
areas pop with light.
Here we are flying over South

2500
01:33:25,732 --> 01:33:27,567
Korea toward Japan.

2501
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:29,036
You can see Tokyo coming into

2502
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:31,038
view at the top, some distant
stars, and even upper reaches of

2503
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:34,608
the Earth's atmosphere, which is

2504
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:37,077
that orange band enveloping the

2505
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:38,211
Earth.

2506
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:42,683
And here's one that might look a

2507
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:43,950
little more familiar.

2508
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,652
This is the Northern California

2509
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:47,888
coast heading southward.

2510
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:49,056
You can see Lake Tahoe

2511
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,658
surrounded by snowcaps and the

2512
01:33:51,658 --> 01:33:54,094
San Francisco Bay.

2513
01:33:54,094 --> 01:33:56,963
These are truly incredible and

2514
01:33:56,963 --> 01:33:58,699
offer such a unique perspective

2515
01:33:58,699 --> 01:33:59,700
on the world.

2516
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,668
I'd like to give a huge thanks

2517
01:34:01,668 --> 01:34:02,969
to the International Space

2518
01:34:02,969 --> 01:34:05,172
Station National Lab and CASIS
for all their help in making

2519
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,475
this a possibility.

2520
01:34:08,475 --> 01:34:14,314
[ Applause ]

2521
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:15,716
These are going to look

2522
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:20,554
incredible at home in 4K HDR.

2523
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,655
So that's tvOS.

2524
01:34:21,655 --> 01:34:24,791
Apple TV gives you amazing

2525
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:27,527
picture and sound with 4K HDR

2526
01:34:27,527 --> 01:34:29,830
and now Dolby Atmos.

2527
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,498
And the Apple TV app is the

2528
01:34:31,498 --> 01:34:33,834
center of your video experience.

2529
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,303
Available on Apple TV, iPad, and

2530
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:38,071
iPhone, it's the one place to

2531
01:34:38,071 --> 01:34:40,107
find all your favorite TV shows,

2532
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:41,675
movies, sports, and news.

2533
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:43,343
And with that, I'll hand it back

2534
01:34:43,343 --> 01:34:43,844
to Tim.

2535
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:44,511
Thank you.

2536
01:34:44,511 --> 01:34:48,415
[ Applause ]
>> Thanks Jen.

2537
01:34:51,384 --> 01:34:55,455
Apple TV 4K and tvOS look and

2538
01:34:55,455 --> 01:34:56,890
sound awesome.

2539
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:58,825
You're really going to love it.
Next up is the Mac.

2540
01:35:01,194 --> 01:35:04,998
At Apple [applause]-- yeah.
We love the Mac.

2541
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,635
The Mac was the first computer

2542
01:35:08,635 --> 01:35:11,605
that made powerful technology so
easy to use and put the customer

2543
01:35:14,007 --> 01:35:16,042
at the center of the experience.

2544
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:17,711
And of course that remains at

2545
01:35:17,711 --> 01:35:19,346
the core of all Apple products.
For more than 30 years, the Mac

2546
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,519
has empowered people to create

2547
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:28,889
all kinds of amazing things,

2548
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:31,124
from the personal to the

2549
01:35:31,124 --> 01:35:32,626
professional.

2550
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,694
Today, we're excited to take Mac

2551
01:35:34,694 --> 01:35:37,197
a huge leap forward.

2552
01:35:37,197 --> 01:35:39,132
The next version of macOS is
chock full of new features

2553
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,236
inspired by pro-users but

2554
01:35:43,236 --> 01:35:45,272
designed for everyone.

2555
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:47,307
I'd like to bring Craig back up

2556
01:35:47,307 --> 01:35:47,841
to talk about it.

2557
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:48,508
Craig.
[ Applause ]

2558
01:35:55,048 --> 01:35:57,818
>> Hello again.

2559
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,586
It's true that macOS is the

2560
01:35:59,586 --> 01:36:03,456
heart of what makes a Mac a Mac.

2561
01:36:03,456 --> 01:36:05,625
And we want as many Mac users as

2562
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:07,127
possible to have access to our

2563
01:36:07,127 --> 01:36:09,229
latest software, and that's why

2564
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:10,831
six years ago with the

2565
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,433
introduction of OS 10 Mavericks,

2566
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,035
we began offering our macOS

2567
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:17,504
updates free for Mac users.

2568
01:36:17,504 --> 01:36:19,606
And 2013 was also the year that

2569
01:36:19,606 --> 01:36:21,208
we first introduced our

2570
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:24,010
California naming theme.

2571
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,946
Now after spending a year by the

2572
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,048
ocean, we not only modernized

2573
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:30,383
the look and feel of macOS, but

2574
01:36:30,383 --> 01:36:32,185
we headed to the mountains with

2575
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:35,222
macOS Yosemite.
Now, as you may be aware, our

2576
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:39,626
naming of Mac releases is

2577
01:36:39,626 --> 01:36:41,595
handled by our crack marketing

2578
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:44,731
organization, and as you've
probably noticed, they went on a

2579
01:36:46,733 --> 01:36:50,937
four-year mountain-bound bender.

2580
01:36:50,937 --> 01:36:52,172
[laughter] In El Capitan we

2581
01:36:52,172 --> 01:36:54,341
added metal, our ground-breaking

2582
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,142
graphics technology.
In Sierra, we brought Siri to

2583
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:58,945
the Mac and extended our

2584
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:01,181
capabilities and continuity.

2585
01:37:01,181 --> 01:37:03,583
And last year with High Sierra,

2586
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:05,619
we focused on deep technology,

2587
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,254
preparing the Mac for future

2588
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:08,521
innovation.

2589
01:37:08,521 --> 01:37:10,090
Well this year, we made some

2590
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:13,193
striking changes to macOS, and

2591
01:37:13,193 --> 01:37:15,395
we've left the high country for

2592
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:17,264
a place entirely different but

2593
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:20,000
not less beautiful and here

2594
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,002
still in California, and I'd

2595
01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:24,104
like to take you there now.

2596
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:30,143
Our next release of macOS is

2597
01:37:30,143 --> 01:37:33,480
macOS Mojave.
[ Applause ]

2598
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,922
Now, Mojave is beautiful during
the day, but what really

2599
01:37:43,323 --> 01:37:45,458
captured our imagination was the
beauty of the desert at night.

2600
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:52,532
And this inspired one of our

2601
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:55,802
most distinctive new features,
and I'd like to show it to you

2602
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:01,708
now.

2603
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:06,112
So here we are live in macOS

2604
01:38:06,112 --> 01:38:09,215
Mojave, and I'd like to show you

2605
01:38:09,215 --> 01:38:11,985
a new side of Mojave.
We call it dark mode.

2606
01:38:15,455 --> 01:38:23,229
[ Applause ]

2607
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:25,432
And as you see, dark mode is not
just about the dock or the menu

2608
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:27,801
bar.

2609
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:28,635
It extends to your Windows

2610
01:38:28,635 --> 01:38:30,103
Chrome, your sidebar, and even

2611
01:38:30,103 --> 01:38:32,138
the content of the Windows, and

2612
01:38:32,138 --> 01:38:33,473
it's so great for Pros.

2613
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:35,675
It makes photographic content

2614
01:38:35,675 --> 01:38:38,611
absolutely pop off the screen.

2615
01:38:38,611 --> 01:38:40,847
It's just gorgeous.

2616
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:44,084
It's so nice.

2617
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,353
And this is great not just for

2618
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,688
photography but when working on

2619
01:38:48,688 --> 01:38:51,558
presentations or documents.

2620
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:53,126
It's also great doing ordinary

2621
01:38:53,126 --> 01:38:53,960
things.

2622
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,694
Maybe you're working in a dark

2623
01:38:54,694 --> 01:38:55,762
environment.
Just look at calendar.

2624
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:00,767
Even mail in dark mode.
It's so great.

2625
01:39:02,535 --> 01:39:04,137
And I think some of us are going

2626
01:39:04,137 --> 01:39:05,372
to want to run dark mode just

2627
01:39:05,372 --> 01:39:07,240
because it's so cool.
I mean your emoji look great.

2628
01:39:09,743 --> 01:39:11,444
Your photos look great.

2629
01:39:11,444 --> 01:39:13,880
I mean check out your album art

2630
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,350
and music or your For You feed

2631
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:18,651
in Apple Music.
But I think one audience that's

2632
01:39:19,886 --> 01:39:21,287
going to especially appreciate

2633
01:39:21,287 --> 01:39:22,455
dark mode are some of you here

2634
01:39:22,455 --> 01:39:25,291
in this room, our developers,

2635
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:27,060
because Expo looks fantastic in

2636
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,461
dark mode.

[ Applause ]

2638
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:35,702
Whether it's your source code or

2639
01:39:35,702 --> 01:39:37,337
even interface builder and all

2640
01:39:37,337 --> 01:39:39,406
of its inspectors, they just
look fantastic in black.

2641
01:39:41,775 --> 01:39:44,611
And that's a quick look at dark

2642
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:46,212
mode.

2643
01:39:46,212 --> 01:39:49,616
Now, we were so inspired by this
changing desktop wallpaper that

2644
01:39:52,185 --> 01:39:53,553
we decided to add a new feature
to Mojave that I think you'll

2645
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:56,356
enjoy.
It's called dynamic desktop, and

2646
01:39:58,658 --> 01:39:59,559
when you're using it, you're

2647
01:39:59,559 --> 01:40:01,895
desktop actually subtly changes

2648
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:04,697
throughout the day from morning,

2649
01:40:04,697 --> 01:40:08,401
to afternoon, to evening.

2650
01:40:08,401 --> 01:40:10,070
It's really cool.

2651
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:12,272
Now, there's much more to Mojave

2652
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:15,141
that I'd like to share with you

2653
01:40:15,141 --> 01:40:17,610
through demos, and it starts

2654
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,712
with the desktop.

2655
01:40:19,712 --> 01:40:23,416
Now, the desktop is so crucial

2656
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:25,185
to how many of us use our Macs.

2657
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,086
When we have files that we're

2658
01:40:26,086 --> 01:40:27,787
actively working on, we often

2659
01:40:27,787 --> 01:40:29,456
put them on the desktop, but the

2660
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:31,491
result can be a desktop that

2661
01:40:31,491 --> 01:40:34,761
looks something like this.

2662
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:36,296
And so now in Mojave we have a

2663
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:38,398
really great solution, and we

2664
01:40:38,398 --> 01:40:42,202
call it Desktop Stacks.

2665
01:40:43,536 --> 01:40:47,107
[ Applause ]

2666
01:40:47,107 --> 01:40:48,808
All of the contents of your

2667
01:40:48,808 --> 01:40:51,444
desktop are automatically

2668
01:40:51,444 --> 01:40:53,680
arranged into these stacks, and

2669
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,683
they can be arranged by kind, by

2670
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:58,985
date, or even by tag, and

2671
01:40:58,985 --> 01:41:00,320
they're really easy to use.

2672
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,588
You just click on them.

2673
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,889
You can see all the contents in

2674
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:03,723
the stack.

2675
01:41:03,723 --> 01:41:05,058
You can double click to open a

2676
01:41:05,058 --> 01:41:07,127
document and put it away.

2677
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:09,262
And they stay organized.
So for instance, if I bring

2678
01:41:10,763 --> 01:41:12,732
forward mail, maybe I drag an

2679
01:41:12,732 --> 01:41:14,067
image out, I want you to watch

2680
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:15,635
what happens because the image

2681
01:41:15,635 --> 01:41:17,770
flies right into the right

2682
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:18,838
stack.
Now you can also scrub your

2683
01:41:20,807 --> 01:41:21,808
stacks.

2684
01:41:21,808 --> 01:41:22,976
So, for instance, I'll just

2685
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:25,845
scrub across this stack.

2686
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:27,714
You see I can select between

2687
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:30,783
different photos, pick one up.

2688
01:41:30,783 --> 01:41:32,018
Actually let me just hide mail

2689
01:41:32,018 --> 01:41:33,553
here mid drag.

2690
01:41:33,553 --> 01:41:36,523
I got a little excited with my,

2691
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:39,726
with all of my stack action.
So I can just drag this out and

2692
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:45,798
drop it in just like that.

2693
01:41:45,798 --> 01:41:47,700
And that's a quick look at

2694
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:48,568
Stacks.

2695
01:41:48,568 --> 01:41:49,536

We've also brought some great

2698
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:57,477
new changes to the finder.

2699
01:41:57,477 --> 01:41:58,978
I'd like to show them to you

2700
01:41:58,978 --> 01:42:00,180
now.

2701
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:04,217
Now it starts with a new view.
We all enjoy using icon view,

2702
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:09,355
list view.

2703
01:42:09,355 --> 01:42:11,357
There's of course column view,

2704
01:42:11,357 --> 01:42:13,693
but now we've added an all-new

2705
01:42:13,693 --> 01:42:15,662
view called gallery view.

2706
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:18,531
It has a big preview up top, a

2707
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:19,832
set of thumbnails along the

2708
01:42:19,832 --> 01:42:21,634
bottom, and it makes it easy to

2709
01:42:21,634 --> 01:42:24,938
preview images, video,

2710
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:28,041
presentations, documents,

2711
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:31,311
spreadsheets, PDFs, and of
course with images sometimes you

2712
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,081
want to know more detail about,

2713
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:35,949
for instance, how they were
captured, and now the new

2714
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:40,153
sidebar in Mojave really helps

2715
01:42:40,153 --> 01:42:42,755
because it now supports full

2716
01:42:42,755 --> 01:42:45,058
metadata, so you can see around

2717
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:47,393
your photo, the camera you took

2718
01:42:47,393 --> 01:42:50,029
the photo on, the kind of lens,

2719
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:51,864
the aperture settings, and so
forth.

2720
01:42:52,498 --> 01:42:53,499
It's really handy.

2721
01:42:53,499 --> 01:42:55,969
And you'll notice also along the

2722
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:57,237
bottom there's this new area

2723
01:42:57,237 --> 01:42:59,606
called Quick Actions, and Quick

2724
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:01,007
Actions that you act on the

2725
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:02,308
current photo.

2726
01:43:02,308 --> 01:43:03,543
So, for instance, if I have a

2727
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:05,278
photo like this and I want to

2728
01:43:05,278 --> 01:43:06,980
edit it, I don't have to open it
and go through a new app.

2729
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:10,450
I can rotate it right here
inside the finder.

2730
01:43:12,685 --> 01:43:14,220
It's really powerful.

2731
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,755
Now this sidebar is available in

2732
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:17,323
other views of the finder.

2733
01:43:17,323 --> 01:43:18,458
So for instance, I'm just going
to bring up the preview pane

2734
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:21,094
here, and I'm going to do a

2735
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:25,131
multi selection of a PDF as well

2736
01:43:25,131 --> 01:43:27,100
as several images, and you'll

2737
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,334
notice that the quick actions
area is contextual, so it shows

2738
01:43:30,536 --> 01:43:33,106
me create PDF as an option.

2739
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:34,407
I'm going to click create PDF,

2740
01:43:34,407 --> 01:43:36,175
and it's going to assemble all

2741
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:38,244
of these photos into a PDF just
like that.

2742
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:41,314
But what's really great is these

2743
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:43,950
actions are also customizable,
so you can create automator

2744
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:47,453
actions and assign them to

2745
01:43:47,453 --> 01:43:50,556
buttons here inside of Finder.
So you'll notice that now that I

2746
01:43:51,624 --> 01:43:53,593
have this PDF selected, I have

2747
01:43:53,593 --> 01:43:55,428
an option to run a custom

2748
01:43:55,428 --> 01:43:56,596
automator action that I've

2749
01:43:56,596 --> 01:43:59,532
created called Watermark PDF.

2750
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:01,200
When I click it, my custom

2751
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:04,237
action runs, and my document is

2752
01:44:04,237 --> 01:44:06,906
watermarked, just like that.

2753
01:44:06,906 --> 01:44:08,408
And those are some quick

2754
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:12,478
enhancements to the finder.

Now a tool that I think many of

2757
01:44:18,217 --> 01:44:20,219
us love when working with files

2758
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:21,587
is Quick Look, and now in

2759
01:44:21,587 --> 01:44:23,656
Mojave, we made Quick Look more
powerful than ever by

2760
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,160
integrating Markup.

2761
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,195
Let me show you how it works.

2762
01:44:29,195 --> 01:44:32,265
So you see down here I have a

2763
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:34,167
permission slip and it's a PDF

2764
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:34,934
document.

2765
01:44:34,934 --> 01:44:36,035
I'm just going to hit tap

2766
01:44:36,035 --> 01:44:38,304
spacebar to Quick Look it, and

2767
01:44:38,304 --> 01:44:40,340
you notice now I have the option

2768
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,775
to invoke Markup.
I click, and now I have access

2769
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,980
to my markup tools, including my

2770
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,816
ability to sign this document.

2771
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:52,051
I can just drag out my signature

2772
01:44:52,051 --> 01:44:55,555
like this, and I'm done.

2773
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:57,957
Now this works for all kinds of

2774
01:44:57,957 --> 01:44:58,791
files.

2775
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,793
So, for instance, with images I
can rotate and crop, and with

2776
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:08,101
video I can even trim right here

2777
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:09,502
inside of Quick Look.

2778
01:45:09,502 --> 01:45:11,838
And that's a quick look at Quick
Look.

Next, I want to talk about how

2781
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:20,046
we capture content on our Mac

2782
01:45:20,046 --> 01:45:21,214
because one of the tools I think

2783
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:22,949
many of us use all the time is

2784
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:24,717
Screenshots, and we've made

2785
01:45:24,717 --> 01:45:26,652
Screenshots more powerful than

2786
01:45:26,652 --> 01:45:29,088
ever in Mohave.

2787
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:32,692
So let's take a look here at a

2788
01:45:32,692 --> 01:45:34,627
webpage, and I'm just going to

2789
01:45:34,627 --> 01:45:35,695
take a screenshot in the
traditional way.

2790
01:45:36,462 --> 01:45:37,430
I'm going to screen shot a

2791
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:40,199
selection of the page, and I
want you to watch what happens

2792
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:42,068
in the lower right.

2793
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:44,871
I get a thumbnail instantly of

2794
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:46,572
that screenshot, and when I

2795
01:45:46,572 --> 01:45:47,640
double click in, I get an

2796
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,976
accelerated workflow right into
Markup where I have access to

2797
01:45:51,444 --> 01:45:53,079
all of my tools.
So, for instance, if I want to

2798
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:57,049
create a magnification here, I

2799
01:45:57,049 --> 01:46:01,454
can just drag that out.

2800
01:46:01,454 --> 01:46:04,724
Magnify. It's that easy.

2801
01:46:04,724 --> 01:46:06,159
But now we've also made it
easier to access a variety of

2802
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:09,929
tools, so when I bring up my

2803
01:46:09,929 --> 01:46:12,064
screenshotting, you see I'm

2804
01:46:12,064 --> 01:46:13,900
presented with this hud that
tells me I can capture the

2805
01:46:15,134 --> 01:46:17,870
entire screen, a selected window

2806
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:19,839
or selection, but we've also

2807
01:46:19,839 --> 01:46:22,775
added screen capture for video

2808
01:46:22,775 --> 01:46:24,811
right into screenshotting.

2809
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:26,212
Let me show you how that works.

2810
01:46:26,212 --> 01:46:27,914
So I'm going to go to a webpage
here that has an animation

2811
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:30,116
running.

2812
01:46:30,116 --> 01:46:31,451
I'm going to bring up my

2813
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,653
screenshotting tools, and say

2814
01:46:33,653 --> 01:46:36,456
record the selected area.

2815
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:37,924
I'll just make a nice selection

2816
01:46:37,924 --> 01:46:39,158
here.

2817
01:46:39,158 --> 01:46:40,760
Okay. And I'm recording just

2818
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,828
like that.

2819
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:42,995
Of course I can manipulate the
app, so all will be reflected in

2820
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:48,401
my recording, and when I'm done,

2821
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:49,535
I can click the stop button

2822
01:46:49,535 --> 01:46:50,837
right up here.

2823
01:46:50,837 --> 01:46:51,804
And now you notice I have this

2824
01:46:51,804 --> 01:46:53,005
thumbnail in the lower right.

2825
01:46:53,005 --> 01:46:55,842
Well I can actually pick this up
and drag it into a new space and

2826
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,846
incorporate it right into a
document, just like that.

2827
01:47:02,615 --> 01:47:04,183
Now, we've further enhanced the

2828
01:47:04,183 --> 01:47:06,385
way you capture content, and

2829
01:47:06,385 --> 01:47:09,055
that brings me to Continuity.

2830
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:11,023
So Mac users love Continuity for

2831
01:47:11,023 --> 01:47:12,391
the way it lets us work across
our devices with things like Air

2832
01:47:15,261 --> 01:47:16,863
Drop or the ability to unlock

2833
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:19,665
your Mac using your Apple Watch.

2834
01:47:19,665 --> 01:47:20,833
When it comes to capturing

2835
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:22,802
content, we'll walk around with

2836
01:47:22,802 --> 01:47:24,170
one of the best content capture

2837
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:25,404
devices in the world in our

2838
01:47:25,404 --> 01:47:27,607
pockets, our phones.
And so we wanted to take

2839
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:30,776
advantage of continuity to bring

2840
01:47:30,776 --> 01:47:32,078
that to the Mac with a feature

2841
01:47:32,078 --> 01:47:34,180
we call Continuity Camera.

2842
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:37,717
Let me show you how it works.
So here in my Keynote

2843
01:47:39,252 --> 01:47:41,387
presentation, I have a space
that's just waiting for a new

2844
01:47:42,955 --> 01:47:44,824
photo, and on my phone right

2845
01:47:44,824 --> 01:47:46,292
here.

2846
01:47:46,292 --> 01:47:47,927
Well, when I select this object,
I can choose to take a photo.

2847
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:51,797
And I want you to watch what
happens when I select this to my

2848
01:47:53,065 --> 01:47:54,033
phone.

2849
01:47:54,033 --> 01:47:56,068
It automatically immediately

2850
01:47:56,068 --> 01:47:59,705
lights up ready to take a photo.

2851
01:47:59,705 --> 01:48:03,743
So I can take one like this, and

2852
01:48:03,743 --> 01:48:06,712
when I do, I can select use

2853
01:48:06,712 --> 01:48:08,681
photo, and it apps directly in
my document.

2854
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:10,449
Isn't that cool?

2855
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:15,187
[ Applause ]

2856
01:48:15,187 --> 01:48:16,222
Now, this works as well for

2857
01:48:16,222 --> 01:48:18,090
scanning documents.

2858
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:19,425
So here I have a place where I

2859
01:48:19,425 --> 01:48:21,327
could use a scan.

2860
01:48:21,327 --> 01:48:23,963
Once again, I'm going to select
from the menu and this time scan

2861
01:48:25,898 --> 01:48:26,732
document.

2862
01:48:26,732 --> 01:48:28,634
Again, my camera lights up, this

2863
01:48:28,634 --> 01:48:29,869
time right in my document

2864
01:48:29,869 --> 01:48:31,003
scanner.

2865
01:48:31,003 --> 01:48:32,204
I just scan like this.

2866
01:48:32,204 --> 01:48:35,575
I can save it.

2867
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:37,543
And my scan goes immediately,

2868
01:48:37,543 --> 01:48:39,912
and I think I forgot to push the

2869
01:48:39,912 --> 01:48:40,713
save button.
Sorry about that everybody.

2870
01:48:42,014 --> 01:48:42,815
There you go, appears
immediately in my document.

2871
01:48:44,817 --> 01:48:46,352
Thank you.

2872
01:48:48,588 --> 01:48:50,489
[applause] And so just like that

2873
01:48:50,489 --> 01:48:53,559
I can take photos, stills, and

2874
01:48:53,559 --> 01:48:55,962
even capture video, and this is

2875
01:48:55,962 --> 01:48:57,463
a quick look at some great new
features in Mojave.

2876
01:48:59,498 --> 01:49:05,304
[ Applause ]

2877
01:49:05,304 --> 01:49:09,809
Next, I'd like to turn to apps.

2878
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:12,445
We are bringing News to the Mac.
[ Applause ]

2879
01:49:15,982 --> 01:49:17,550
Now News has all of the stories

2880
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:19,285
you've come to expect from News

2881
01:49:19,285 --> 01:49:21,554
on iOS, and it looks amazing on

2882
01:49:21,554 --> 01:49:22,955
the Mac display.

2883
01:49:22,955 --> 01:49:25,057
You get top stories picked by

2884
01:49:25,057 --> 01:49:28,527
our editors, trending stories,

2885
01:49:28,527 --> 01:49:30,563
you're personalized for you and

2886
01:49:30,563 --> 01:49:34,900
that's not for me, and you also
get this great new sidebar where

2887
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:38,738
you can drill in and jump right

2888
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,473
to the topics and channels you

2889
01:49:40,473 --> 01:49:41,240
follow.

2890
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,975
News is going to be great.

2891
01:49:42,975 --> 01:49:45,277
We also have Stocks coming to

2892
01:49:45,277 --> 01:49:46,412
the Mac.

2893
01:49:46,412 --> 01:49:48,047
Now you get your stock prices
combined with high-quality

2894
01:49:49,582 --> 01:49:51,550
business news delivered from

2895
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:52,818
Apple News.

2896
01:49:52,818 --> 01:49:54,220
It shows you your watch list

2897
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,888
with your prices on the left,

2898
01:49:55,888 --> 01:49:57,690
and you can drill in to this

2899
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:59,725
interactive chart to get more

2900
01:49:59,725 --> 01:50:02,061
information and, of course,
great news.

2901
01:50:03,829 --> 01:50:06,332
We're also bringing Voice Memos

2902
01:50:06,332 --> 01:50:07,133
to the Mac.
Now Voice Memos is the most

2903
01:50:08,768 --> 01:50:11,837
popular voice recorder on iOS,

2904
01:50:11,837 --> 01:50:14,140
and so many of us use it to

2905
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,042
capture music recordings or

2906
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,943
lectures, and now that Voice

2907
01:50:17,943 --> 01:50:21,013
Memos syncs via iCloud to your

2908
01:50:21,013 --> 01:50:21,914
Mac, you can take those

2909
01:50:21,914 --> 01:50:23,449
recordings that you make and for

2910
01:50:23,449 --> 01:50:24,984
instance drag them right into

2911
01:50:24,984 --> 01:50:26,819
Garage Band as the foundation

2912
01:50:26,819 --> 01:50:28,254
for a song.
Finally, thrilled to announce

2913
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:32,525
Home is coming to the Mac as

2914
01:50:32,525 --> 01:50:33,526
well.

2915
01:50:33,526 --> 01:50:38,431
[ Applause ]

2916
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:39,932
You have all of your accessories

2917
01:50:39,932 --> 01:50:40,766
here.

2918
01:50:40,766 --> 01:50:43,369
You can run your scenes as well

2919
01:50:43,369 --> 01:50:45,705
as monitor your video cameras,

2920
01:50:45,705 --> 01:50:47,873
and of course with Siri you can

2921
01:50:47,873 --> 01:50:49,508
command your home with your

2922
01:50:49,508 --> 01:50:50,443
voice.

2923
01:50:50,443 --> 01:50:53,479
So those are four great new apps

2924
01:50:53,479 --> 01:50:56,549
coming to Mojave.

2925
01:50:56,549 --> 01:51:00,152
[ Applause ]

2926
01:51:00,152 --> 01:51:01,821
Next, I'd like to talk about

2927
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,823
security and privacy.

2928
01:51:03,823 --> 01:51:05,958
You know, one of the reasons
that people choose Apple

2929
01:51:07,293 --> 01:51:08,761
products is because of our

2930
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:10,596
commitment to security and
privacy.

2931
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:14,300
And we believe that your private

2932
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,736
data should remain private, not

2933
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,137
because you've done something

2934
01:51:18,137 --> 01:51:19,338
wrong or that you have something

2935
01:51:19,338 --> 01:51:21,073
to hide but because there can be

2936
01:51:21,073 --> 01:51:22,942
a lot of sensitive data on your

2937
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:24,910
devices, and we think you should

2938
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,546
be in control of who sees it.

2939
01:51:27,546 --> 01:51:29,548
Now, to begin we protect your
information on your devices

2940
01:51:32,084 --> 01:51:34,320
using state of the art hardware

2941
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,489
and software, and this year

2942
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,557
we're adding greater protections

2943
01:51:38,557 --> 01:51:40,326
about how apps can access that

2944
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:42,027
information.

2945
01:51:42,027 --> 01:51:44,163
Today, Apple devices check in
with you before granting an app

2946
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:47,733
access to information like your

2947
01:51:47,733 --> 01:51:49,001
location.

2948
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:50,169
You could tell because you'll

2949
01:51:50,169 --> 01:51:52,071
see an alert just like this one,

2950
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:54,140
and macOS already provides

2951
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,609
API-level protections for things

2952
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:59,245
like contacts, photos, calendar,
and reminders, but now in

2953
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:02,848
Mojave, we're extending these

2954
01:52:02,848 --> 01:52:04,984
protections to include your

2955
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:07,820
camera and your microphone as
well as protecting sensitive

2956
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:10,756
parts of your file system, like

2957
01:52:10,756 --> 01:52:12,525
your mail database, your message
history, and your backups.

2958
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:16,762
And all of this is protected by
default for any app that you run

2959
01:52:19,231 --> 01:52:20,332
on the system, an important

2960

2962
01:52:27,106 --> 01:52:28,107
Next, I want to turn to some

2963
01:52:28,107 --> 01:52:30,409
great enhancements to Safari.

2964
01:52:30,409 --> 01:52:32,278
Safari works really hard to

2965
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:33,846
protect your privacy, and this
year it's working even harder.

2966
01:52:36,115 --> 01:52:37,850
Last year, we introduced

2967
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,919
intelligent tracking prevention
to dramatically reduce the

2968
01:52:41,554 --> 01:52:43,455
ability for apps to track you

2969
01:52:43,455 --> 01:52:46,625
across websites using cookies.

2970
01:52:46,625 --> 01:52:47,560
This is the kind of thing where

2971
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:48,961
you look at a product on one

2972
01:52:48,961 --> 01:52:49,795
site.

2973
01:52:49,795 --> 01:52:51,397
Then you move to another site

2974
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,098
and another site and somehow

2975
01:52:53,098 --> 01:52:54,166
this is just following you

2976
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:56,235
wherever you go.
Well, we've all seen these,

2977
01:52:58,170 --> 01:53:00,439
these like buttons and share

2978
01:53:00,439 --> 01:53:02,675
buttons and these comment

2979
01:53:02,675 --> 01:53:03,843
fields.

2980
01:53:03,843 --> 01:53:05,845
Well, it turns out these can be

2981
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:07,780
used to track you, whether you
click on them or not, and so

2982
01:53:10,482 --> 01:53:12,451
this year we are shutting that

2983
01:53:12,451 --> 01:53:14,486
down.

2984
01:53:14,486 --> 01:53:22,027
[ Applause ]

2985
01:53:22,027 --> 01:53:22,995
Now if you do want to interact

2986
01:53:22,995 --> 01:53:23,929
with one of these or one of

2987
01:53:23,929 --> 01:53:25,497
these apps tries to access that

2988
01:53:25,497 --> 01:53:28,167
information, you'll get this,

2989
01:53:28,167 --> 01:53:30,402
and you can decide to keep your

2990
01:53:30,402 --> 01:53:32,371
information private.

2991
01:53:32,371 --> 01:53:37,209
Now next let's talk about

2992
01:53:37,209 --> 01:53:38,477
Fingerprinting.

2993
01:53:38,477 --> 01:53:40,779
You know, data companies are

2994
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:43,115
clever and relentless, and in
addition to cookies, they use

2995
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:47,019
another method called

2996
01:53:47,019 --> 01:53:48,254
Fingerprinting.

2997
01:53:48,254 --> 01:53:49,855
And here's how it works.

2998
01:53:49,855 --> 01:53:51,357
Just like you can be identified

2999
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:53,525
by a fingerprint, it turns out

3000
01:53:53,525 --> 01:53:55,828
that when you browse the web,

3001
01:53:55,828 --> 01:53:57,496
you're device can be identify by

3002
01:53:57,496 --> 01:53:59,965
a unique set of characteristics,

3003
01:53:59,965 --> 01:54:02,368
like its configuration, its

3004
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,003
fonts that you have installed
and the plug-insulin that you

3005
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:06,639
might have on the device.

3006
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,607
And these data companies can use

3007
01:54:08,607 --> 01:54:10,109
the set of characteristics to

3008
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:12,311
construct a unique fingerprint
to track your device from site

3009
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,615
to site.

3010
01:54:16,615 --> 01:54:17,850
With Mojave, we're making it

3011
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,185
much harder for trackers to

3012
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:21,987
create a unique fingerprint.

3013
01:54:21,987 --> 01:54:23,289
We're presenting webpages with

3014
01:54:23,289 --> 01:54:24,790
only a simplified system

3015
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:26,458
configuration.

3016
01:54:26,458 --> 01:54:27,860
We show them only built-in

3017
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:30,396
fonts, and Legacy plug-insulin

3018
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:31,397
are no longer supported, so

3019
01:54:31,397 --> 01:54:32,765
those can't contribute to a

3020
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:34,733
fingerprint, and as a result,

3021
01:54:34,733 --> 01:54:36,635
your Mac will look more like

3022
01:54:36,635 --> 01:54:38,270
everyone else's Mac, and it will

3023
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:39,939
be dramatically more difficult

3024
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:41,273
for data companies to uniquely

3025
01:54:41,273 --> 01:54:42,808
identify your device and track

3026
01:54:42,808 --> 01:54:43,509
you.

completely redesigned App Store
on iOS.

We've written more than 4000
stories for the New Today tab,

3042
01:55:26,518 --> 01:55:28,620
and hundreds of them have each

3043
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:30,589
been read by more than a million

3044

people.

3045
01:55:31,724 --> 01:55:32,791
The response has been

3046
01:55:32,791 --> 01:55:34,093

that we'll cover in sessions.

3051
01:55:39,798 --> 01:55:41,900
This year, we are turning our

3052
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:47,439
attention to the Mac App Store.

3053
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:48,307
[applause] Since it launched in
2011, it's changed the way we

download and install software

3055
01:55:52,244 --> 01:55:54,880
for Mac, making it easy with one

click.

3057
01:55:56,148 --> 01:55:57,716
It's the biggest catalogue of

3058
01:55:57,716 --> 01:55:59,785
Mac apps in the world.
It's also a trusted and safe

3059
01:56:01,453 --> 01:56:03,255
place to download software.

3060
01:56:03,255 --> 01:56:05,257
Entrusting where you get your
apps from has become more

3061
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:08,394
important than ever.

3062
01:56:08,394 --> 01:56:10,095
Developers can distribute their

3063
01:56:10,095 --> 01:56:12,898
apps to 155 countries and get

3064
01:56:12,898 --> 01:56:14,533
worldwide payment processing,

3065
01:56:14,533 --> 01:56:17,236
and it offers seamless software
updates from one place.

3066
01:56:18,337 --> 01:56:20,639
This adds up to a great

3067

experience for our users.

3068
01:56:23,542 --> 01:56:24,610
We've spent a lot of time
thinking about what people do on

3069
01:56:26,612 --> 01:56:28,414
their Macs and wanting to create

3070

a place organized around those

themes.

up, and we're thrilled to show

3075
01:56:37,656 --> 01:56:38,490

It's got a beautiful UI that

3078
01:56:47,299 --> 01:56:49,535
should feel familiar but new and

3079
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:51,170
designed first and foremost to

3080
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:53,338
be a great Mac app.

3081
01:56:53,338 --> 01:56:54,506
Starting with the new discover

best Mac apps through stories

01:57:01,013 --> 01:57:03,348
and collections and see what's

3085
01:57:03,348 --> 01:57:06,652
most popular with top charts.

3086
01:57:06,652 --> 01:57:08,754

Helpful videos auto play, so you

3092
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:22,234
can see what apps are capable of

before downloading them.
Visit the all-new create, work,

3095
01:57:30,442 --> 01:57:31,477
you'll find helpful

01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:33,779
recommendations and expertise

3097
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:36,682
around each theme.
Here's the create tab where you

3098
01:57:37,816 --> 01:57:39,418
can find apps that bring your

3099
01:57:39,418 --> 01:57:41,787
artistic ideas to light.

3100
01:57:41,787 --> 01:57:43,455
These tabs will also help you

3101
01:57:43,455 --> 01:57:44,890
make the most of apps you might

3102
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,625
already have with tips and

3103
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:48,560
tutorials even the most expert

3104
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:51,063
users will find useful.

3105
01:57:51,063 --> 01:57:55,534
The work, play, and develop tabs

3106
01:57:55,534 --> 01:57:57,736
share the same beautiful design,

3107
01:57:57,736 --> 01:57:59,037
and you can still browse by

3108
01:57:59,037 --> 01:58:03,041
category on the categories tab.

3109
01:58:03,041 --> 01:58:04,676
We've redesigned product pages

3110
01:58:04,676 --> 01:58:06,745
too, bringing many features over
from iOS based on our learnings

3111
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:09,515
there.

3112
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:11,416
It has more useful information

3113
01:58:11,416 --> 01:58:13,418
like video previews available on
the Mac App Store for the first

3114
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,389
time, an apps rank if it's

3115
01:58:17,389 --> 01:58:18,690
charting and if it's been named
editor's choice.

3116
01:58:20,125 --> 01:58:23,028
Ratings and reviews are now

3117
01:58:23,028 --> 01:58:25,197
front and center, and these are

3118
01:58:25,197 --> 01:58:27,266
so important for app discovery.
So we're introducing a ratings

3119
01:58:29,134 --> 01:58:32,004
and review API for Mac apps.

3120
01:58:32,004 --> 01:58:33,872
Now, it'll be easier than ever

3121
01:58:33,872 --> 01:58:36,808
for people to leave feedback.

3122
01:58:36,808 --> 01:58:38,410
We're really excited about the

3123
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:40,179
all-new Mac App Store.

3124
01:58:40,179 --> 01:58:41,480
We've talked to some developers
already, and they're really

3125
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:44,249
excited too.
Like Microsoft, who will bring

3126
01:58:46,351 --> 01:58:48,820
Office 365 to the Mac App Store

3127
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:50,489
later this year.

3128
01:58:50,489 --> 01:58:54,026
[ Applause ]

3129
01:58:54,026 --> 01:58:55,928
And Adobe is bringing Lightroom

3130
01:58:55,928 --> 01:58:57,696
CC.

3131
01:58:57,696 --> 01:58:59,865
Panic is bringing Transmit.

3132
01:58:59,865 --> 01:59:03,435
And Bare Bones is bringing BB

3133
01:59:03,435 --> 01:59:04,269
Edit.

3134
01:59:04,269 --> 01:59:07,306
[applause] And many more great
names are coming to the all-new

3135
01:59:09,007 --> 01:59:11,043
Mac App Store too.

3136
01:59:11,043 --> 01:59:12,377
We can't wait for you to check

3137
01:59:12,377 --> 01:59:14,146
out the new Mac App Store.
Now, I'll hand it back to Craig.

3138
01:59:17,449 --> 01:59:23,455
[ Applause ]

3139
01:59:23,455 --> 01:59:24,990
So we think the Mac App Store is

3140
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:26,558
going to inspire whole-new

3141
01:59:26,558 --> 01:59:28,527
generations of apps, and so we

3142
01:59:28,527 --> 01:59:29,895
want to talk about some of the

3143
01:59:29,895 --> 01:59:32,698
technologies that will be behind

3144
01:59:32,698 --> 01:59:34,766
some of that next generation.
We spoke earlier about ARKit.

3145
01:59:36,768 --> 01:59:39,671
I want to talk about two more.

3146
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:42,341
And let's start with Metal.

3147
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:43,976
Now Metal is the technology to
get the highest performance

3148
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:47,613
graphics and computation from

3149
01:59:47,613 --> 01:59:49,281
graphics processors.

3150
01:59:49,281 --> 01:59:50,949
Metal was designed for modern

3151
01:59:50,949 --> 01:59:51,783
GPUs.

3152
01:59:51,783 --> 01:59:54,219
It's incredibly efficient, and

3153
01:59:54,219 --> 01:59:55,320
that enables amazing

3154
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:57,055
console-level games like

3155
01:59:57,055 --> 01:59:59,524
Fortnight from Epic to run great

3156
01:59:59,524 --> 02:00:02,628
for the first time on mobile.
But Metal also enables these

3157
02:00:04,263 --> 02:00:06,732
games to scale to take full

3158
02:00:06,732 --> 02:00:09,368
advantage of modern Macs.

3159
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:11,536
In fact, across iOS and the Mac,

3160
02:00:11,536 --> 02:00:13,438
there are over one billion

3161
02:00:13,438 --> 02:00:16,608
Metal-enabled devices, and we're

3162
02:00:16,608 --> 02:00:18,944
constantly making Metal better.

3163
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,812
To bring the highest GPU
performance in reach of all

3164
02:00:22,914 --> 02:00:24,082
Macs, we've recently added

3165
02:00:24,082 --> 02:00:28,687
support for external GPUs, and

3166
02:00:28,687 --> 02:00:30,422
this is powered by Metal, and

3167
02:00:30,422 --> 02:00:31,890
the results are truly mind

3168
02:00:31,890 --> 02:00:32,891
boggling.
For instance, running a filter

3169
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:36,828
in DaVinci Resolve, look at how

3170
02:00:36,828 --> 02:00:38,897
it scales on the incredibly fast
iMac Pro as you add up to four

3171
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:42,634
eGPUs.

3172
02:00:42,634 --> 02:00:45,070
Now, the results are even more

3173
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:46,371
staggering when you take a

3174
02:00:46,371 --> 02:00:48,507
13-inch MacBook Pro and add
eGPUs to it, achieving up to 8.5

3175
02:00:51,843 --> 02:00:53,245
times speedup.

3176
02:00:53,245 --> 02:00:55,414
It's pretty awesome.

3177
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:57,649
Now, eGPUs also enable Macs to

3178
02:00:57,649 --> 02:00:58,984
achieve all-new levels of

3179
02:00:58,984 --> 02:01:00,852
performance and realism in 3D
rendering and gaming.

3180
02:01:02,821 --> 02:01:04,256
Now this beautiful forest you

3181
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,091
see here, this isn't a video

3182
02:01:06,091 --> 02:01:07,326
capture.

3183
02:01:07,326 --> 02:01:09,661
This is from Unity's new Book of

3184
02:01:09,661 --> 02:01:11,596
the Dead interactive demo, and
it's being rendered live right

3185
02:01:13,832 --> 02:01:16,935
now on a MacBook with an eGPU

3186
02:01:16,935 --> 02:01:18,637
powering this display.
I mean doesn't this look

3187
02:01:19,771 --> 02:01:20,505
amazing?

3188
02:01:20,505 --> 02:01:25,711
[ Applause ]

3189
02:01:25,711 --> 02:01:27,012
Now, of course because this is
rendered live, we can check

3190
02:01:29,014 --> 02:01:30,449
what's up ahead, so let's start
walking.

3191
02:01:32,217 --> 02:01:33,952
Now Unity is using Metal's

3192
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:36,655
unified graphics and compute to
generate real-time lighting and

3193
02:01:39,124 --> 02:01:43,195
complex post-processing effects.

3194
02:01:43,195 --> 02:01:46,832
So cool. And that's all rendered

3195
02:01:46,832 --> 02:01:49,101
live on a MacBook running with
an eGPU.

3196
02:01:50,102 --> 02:01:51,536
It's pretty great.

3197
02:01:51,536 --> 02:01:57,075
[ Applause ]

3198
02:01:57,075 --> 02:01:58,076
Now another place where we're

3199
02:01:58,076 --> 02:01:59,378
doing incredible acceleration

3200
02:01:59,378 --> 02:02:01,313
with Metal is in machine

3201
02:02:01,313 --> 02:02:02,214
learning.

3202
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:04,850
And today ML specialists usually

3203
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:07,319
use one of these third-party

3204
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:09,187
libraries to train their models
using servers, and now it turns

3205
02:02:11,356 --> 02:02:13,291
out we can accelerate tools like

3206
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:14,459
this with our new Metal

3207
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:16,027
performance shaders.

3208
02:02:16,027 --> 02:02:17,596
We're seeing speedups of up to
20 times and using the GPU with

3209
02:02:20,165 --> 02:02:21,600
Metal instead of CPU-based

3210
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,467
training.
And while speeding these tools

3211
02:02:23,802 --> 02:02:25,437
up is great, we actually thing

3212
02:02:25,437 --> 02:02:26,905
there's a better way for most

3213
02:02:26,905 --> 02:02:29,207
developers, and that's training

3214
02:02:29,207 --> 02:02:31,476
on the Mac you already have
using a great new tool we call

3215
02:02:33,845 --> 02:02:35,514
Create ML.

3216
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:40,051
[ Applause ]

3217
02:02:40,051 --> 02:02:41,920
Now, Create ML is designed to

3218
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:43,822
let you train without being a

3219
02:02:43,822 --> 02:02:45,557
machine learning expert.

3220
02:02:45,557 --> 02:02:47,492
You can train vision and natural

3221
02:02:47,492 --> 02:02:48,360
language models.
You can bring your own custom

3222
02:02:49,928 --> 02:02:51,196
data, and it's really easy to

3223
02:02:51,196 --> 02:02:52,831
use because it's all built in

3224
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:53,965
Swift.

3225
02:02:53,965 --> 02:02:55,333
In fact, you can use Xcode
Playgrounds to train your model.

3226
02:02:56,768 --> 02:02:58,870
Just drag one in, you're

3227
02:02:58,870 --> 02:03:00,272
training set, you can drag in

3228
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:01,973
your test set as well, and the

3229
02:03:01,973 --> 02:03:03,809
training is all GPU accelerated,

3230
02:03:03,809 --> 02:03:06,278
so it's incredibly fast.

3231
02:03:06,278 --> 02:03:07,913
Now, as an example, we worked
with Memrise.

3232
02:03:09,114 --> 02:03:10,816
They're a developer who uses the

3233
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:13,018
camera to identify objects and

3234
02:03:13,018 --> 02:03:13,852
speak them in multiple

3235
02:03:13,852 --> 02:03:15,987
languages, and in the past, they

3236
02:03:15,987 --> 02:03:16,888
would train their model with

3237
02:03:16,888 --> 02:03:18,723
20,000 images, and it would take

3238
02:03:18,723 --> 02:03:21,827
them 24 hours to do so.

3239
02:03:21,827 --> 02:03:23,895
Well now with Create ML, they

3240
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:27,232
can train that same model in 48
minutes on a MacBook Pro.

3241
02:03:29,501 --> 02:03:34,539
[ Applause ]

3242
02:03:34,539 --> 02:03:37,175
And on iMac Pro, it's just 18

3243
02:03:37,175 --> 02:03:38,009
minutes.

3244
02:03:38,009 --> 02:03:39,444
And what's even more incredible

3245
02:03:39,444 --> 02:03:41,046
is that model in the past for

3246
02:03:41,046 --> 02:03:43,482
them was 90 megabytes, and now

3247
02:03:43,482 --> 02:03:45,550
it's just three megabytes.

3248
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:48,520
It's a huge difference.

3249
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:52,224
[ Applause ]

3250
02:03:52,224 --> 02:03:53,959
Now we also are making models

3251
02:03:53,959 --> 02:03:55,894
run much faster on device using

3252
02:03:55,894 --> 02:03:56,962
Core ML 2.

3253
02:03:56,962 --> 02:03:58,530
Now Core ML is our technology
for high performance on-device

3254
02:04:00,131 --> 02:04:01,800
machine learning, and now it's

3255
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,468
better than ever.

3256
02:04:03,468 --> 02:04:05,070
It's 30 percent faster in

3257
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:06,638
on-device processing using a

3258
02:04:06,638 --> 02:04:07,772
technique called batch

3259
02:04:07,772 --> 02:04:09,808
predictions, and you can reduce

3260
02:04:09,808 --> 02:04:12,043
your model size by up to 75

3261
02:04:12,043 --> 02:04:14,646
percent using quantization.

3262
02:04:14,646 --> 02:04:17,983
And so that's Core ML and Create

3263
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:18,783
ML.

3264
02:04:18,783 --> 02:04:19,784
You no longer have to be an
expert in machine learning to

3265
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:25,223
build those techniques into your

3266
02:04:25,223 --> 02:04:26,024
app.

3267
02:04:26,024 --> 02:04:27,526
Now, these technologies are
redefining what's possible in

3268
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:31,963
apps, and they're common not
just to macOS but also to iOS,

3269
02:04:34,032 --> 02:04:36,034
and the fact that the mac and
iOS share so much technology has

3270
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:41,706
led people almost every year to

3271
02:04:41,706 --> 02:04:44,342
keep asking us the question, are
you merging iOS and macOS?

3272
02:04:47,746 --> 02:04:49,714
So I'd like to take a moment to

3273
02:04:49,714 --> 02:04:52,183
briefly address this question.

3274
02:04:52,183 --> 02:04:55,520
No. Of course not.

[ Applause ]

3276
02:05:00,792 --> 02:05:02,661
We love the Mac because it's,

3277
02:05:02,661 --> 02:05:04,262
and we love macOS because it's

3278
02:05:04,262 --> 02:05:07,966
explicitly created that a unique

3279
02:05:07,966 --> 02:05:10,135
characteristics of Mac hardware,

3280
02:05:10,135 --> 02:05:11,636
like the ergonomics of the

3281
02:05:11,636 --> 02:05:13,505
keyboard and the trackpad, the

3282
02:05:13,505 --> 02:05:15,440
flexibility in displays and
storage and because of the power

3283
02:05:17,375 --> 02:05:18,076
it exposes.

3284
02:05:18,076 --> 02:05:19,010
It makes the Mac able to

3285
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:21,212
accomplish almost anything.

3286
02:05:21,212 --> 02:05:22,881
So we think that this question

3287
02:05:22,881 --> 02:05:24,149
is actually coming from

3288
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:26,017
something else.
You know, Mac users have access

3289
02:05:28,086 --> 02:05:30,989
to a rich set of great native
applications, apps that take

3290
02:05:32,991 --> 02:05:35,060
full advantage of the power of

3291
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,761
Mac technologies.

3292
02:05:36,761 --> 02:05:38,997
But Mac users also use apps

3293
02:05:38,997 --> 02:05:40,865
based on other technologies.
We routinely access web-based

3294
02:05:42,734 --> 02:05:44,603
experiences like Netflix that

3295
02:05:44,603 --> 02:05:46,638
build on WebKit, the

3296
02:05:46,638 --> 02:05:48,406
standards-based web technology

3297
02:05:48,406 --> 02:05:50,642
in Safari, and we also run

3298
02:05:50,642 --> 02:05:53,144
sometimes cross-platform games

3299
02:05:53,144 --> 02:05:55,780
built on technology like metal.
And all of these platforms

3300
02:05:58,817 --> 02:06:00,085
enrich the Mac user's

3301
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:01,353
experience.

3302
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:02,954
But we think there's room for

3303
02:06:02,954 --> 02:06:05,090
one more, and so we'd like to

3304
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,591
give you a sneak peek of a

3305
02:06:06,591 --> 02:06:08,627
multiyear project we have going

3306
02:06:08,627 --> 02:06:09,361
on.
Because we see a huge

3307
02:06:10,795 --> 02:06:12,330
opportunity for the Mac to tap

3308
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:14,065
into the world's most vital app

3309
02:06:14,065 --> 02:06:15,634
ecosystem.

3310
02:06:15,634 --> 02:06:16,701
It's called iOS.

3311
02:06:16,701 --> 02:06:18,269
I think you might be familiar

3312
02:06:18,269 --> 02:06:19,270
with it.

3313
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:21,072
Now, there are millions of iOS

3314
02:06:21,072 --> 02:06:22,607
apps out there, and we think

3315
02:06:22,607 --> 02:06:24,175
some of them would be absolutely

3316
02:06:24,175 --> 02:06:26,845
great on the Mac, and Mac users

3317
02:06:26,845 --> 02:06:28,380
would love to have them there.

3318
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:30,915
And from a technical standpoint,

3319
02:06:30,915 --> 02:06:32,417
it's actually a really good fit

3320
02:06:32,417 --> 02:06:34,452
because from day one iOS and

3321
02:06:34,452 --> 02:06:35,854
macOS have shared common

3322
02:06:35,854 --> 02:06:37,522
foundations.

3323
02:06:37,522 --> 02:06:39,591
But iOS devices and Mac devices

3324
02:06:39,591 --> 02:06:40,992
of course are different, and the

3325
02:06:40,992 --> 02:06:42,594
user interfaces are somewhat

3326
02:06:42,594 --> 02:06:44,029
different and so the frameworks

3327
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:45,330
underneath are as well.
And that makes today porting an

3328
02:06:46,831 --> 02:06:49,000
app from one to the other some

3329
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,268
work.

3330
02:06:50,268 --> 02:06:51,836
We wanted to make this much

3331
02:06:51,836 --> 02:06:54,739
easier, and so we've taken some
key frameworks from iOS and

3332
02:06:57,509 --> 02:06:59,544
brought them to the Mac.

3333
02:06:59,544 --> 02:07:00,945
And we've adapted them to

3334
02:07:00,945 --> 02:07:02,747
specific Mac behaviors like use

3335
02:07:02,747 --> 02:07:05,016
of trackpad and mouse, window
resizing, integration of things

3336
02:07:07,185 --> 02:07:08,953
like copy and paste and drag and

3337
02:07:08,953 --> 02:07:10,588
drop into the system services on
the mac.

3338
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:14,626
Now, phase one of this effort is

3339
02:07:14,626 --> 02:07:16,728
to test it on ourselves.

3340
02:07:16,728 --> 02:07:18,396
So this year in macOS, we've

3341
02:07:18,396 --> 02:07:22,067
taken some of our own iOS apps,

3342
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:23,635
and we brought them to the Mac

3343
02:07:23,635 --> 02:07:25,103
using those technologies to make

3344
02:07:25,103 --> 02:07:26,638
sure it works well.

3345
02:07:26,638 --> 02:07:27,605
You've actually heard about

3346
02:07:27,605 --> 02:07:29,441
several of them earlier today,

3347
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:33,211
and it turns out they make

3348
02:07:33,211 --> 02:07:35,413
fantastic Mac apps, and we're
able to bring them to the Mac

3349
02:07:37,549 --> 02:07:40,085
with very few code changes.

3350
02:07:40,085 --> 02:07:41,586
Now, this is going to be coming

3351
02:07:41,586 --> 02:07:44,489
to you developers next year.
So you can easily bring your iOS

3352
02:07:46,357 --> 02:07:48,226
apps to the Mac, and in the

3353
02:07:48,226 --> 02:07:50,028
meantime, we hope you enjoy

3354
02:07:50,028 --> 02:07:52,864
News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and
Home in Mojave.

3355
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:57,135
Now we're really excited about

3356
02:07:57,135 --> 02:07:58,203
Mojave.

3357
02:07:58,203 --> 02:08:01,372
From desktop, Stacks, to Finder

3358
02:08:01,372 --> 02:08:04,242
with gallery view to enhanced

3359
02:08:04,242 --> 02:08:07,645
screenshots and markup, News and

3360
02:08:07,645 --> 02:08:09,114
Home on the Mac for the first
time.

3361
02:08:10,482 --> 02:08:12,917
Stocks and of course the

3362
02:08:12,917 --> 02:08:14,686
redesigned Mac App Store.
And of course there's even more.

3363
02:08:18,356 --> 02:08:20,992
Like APFS now supports Fusion

3364
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:23,728
and hard drives, and Safari tabs

3365
02:08:23,728 --> 02:08:25,163
can now have favicons if you
want them there.

3366
02:08:26,598 --> 02:08:30,068
And, of course, Group Facetime.

3367
02:08:30,068 --> 02:08:31,803
So that's macOS Mojave.

3368
02:08:31,803 --> 02:08:33,204
I hope you like it.

3369
02:08:33,204 --> 02:08:34,305
I'm going to hand it back to

3370

What a huge update to macOS and
what an extraordinary morning.

3375
02:08:49,988 --> 02:08:53,391
We got started with iOS 12 with
all-new capabilities including

3376
02:08:55,627 --> 02:08:56,961
taking AR further than ever

3377
02:08:56,961 --> 02:09:01,566
before, bringing Siri to any app

3378
02:09:01,566 --> 02:09:03,067
with Siri Shortcuts and

3379
02:09:03,067 --> 02:09:04,803
ScreenTime and cool new

3380
02:09:04,803 --> 02:09:06,304
communication features like

3381
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:08,773
Memoji and Group Facetime.

3382
02:09:08,773 --> 02:09:10,875
And watchOS, now with Walkie

3383
02:09:10,875 --> 02:09:13,678
Talkie, Activity, Competitions,

3384

And Apple TV 4K now with Adobe

3387
02:09:21,219 --> 02:09:22,887
Atmos, some great new

3388
02:09:22,887 --> 02:09:25,123
partnerships, and the ease of

3389
02:09:25,123 --> 02:09:26,658
zero sign-on.

3390
02:09:26,658 --> 02:09:27,692
And you're going to really love

3391
02:09:27,692 --> 02:09:30,829
those new Aerial screensavers.

3392

3398
02:09:45,009 --> 02:09:46,778
The updates will be available to

3399
02:09:46,778 --> 02:09:50,014
our users this Fall, and there

3400

to celebrate you and the amazing

work that you do, so we went out

important people in your lives,

the ones that know you the best,

3411
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:21,246
and we made a short video, and

02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,895
And they'd go, wow.

3451
02:11:45,063 --> 02:11:46,064
>> When he first came to us with

3452
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:48,566
the idea, we were like, okay,
good luck.

3453
02:11:50,501 --> 02:11:51,936
>> He started off in his small
little one-bedroom apartment

3454
02:11:53,004 --> 02:11:54,605
with next to nothing,

3455
02:11:54,605 --> 02:11:56,708
and sacrificed eating a burger

3456
02:11:56,708 --> 02:11:58,176
and just have ramen just so that

3457
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,645
he could, and I'm like just buy

3458
02:12:00,645 --> 02:12:01,479
the burger.

3459
02:12:01,479 --> 02:12:02,313
And he's like no, that's three

3460
02:12:02,313 --> 02:12:03,414
bucks that I could put towards

3461
02:12:03,414 --> 02:12:04,248
the app.

3462
02:12:04,248 --> 02:12:06,117
>> Jeremy went out to build the

3463
02:12:06,117 --> 02:12:07,385
first version of Yelp, and it

3464
02:12:07,385 --> 02:12:08,653
was a total bust, a total

3465
02:12:08,653 --> 02:12:09,487
failure.

3466
02:12:09,487 --> 02:12:11,689
>> She tried really hard on a

3467
02:12:11,689 --> 02:12:13,624
couple different titles, and
you've never heard of them.

3468
02:12:14,792 --> 02:12:16,527
And, you know, that's a really

3469
02:12:16,527 --> 02:12:17,328
rough feeling.

3470
02:12:17,328 --> 02:12:18,930
>> That was definitely a low

3471
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:20,565
point for Jeremy because it was
like, hey we got to retool and

3472
02:12:22,734 --> 02:12:23,568
try again.

3473
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,136
What Jeremy did notice in the

3474
02:12:25,136 --> 02:12:26,537
data was that people loved

3475
02:12:26,537 --> 02:12:28,373
writing comments, and that was
really the genesis of the second

3476
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:32,076
version of Yelp, which worked.

3477
02:12:32,076 --> 02:12:33,644
>> You have to be really okay

3478
02:12:33,644 --> 02:12:35,179
with waking up to failure and

3479
02:12:35,179 --> 02:12:36,848
then at the end of a whole bunch

3480
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:37,849
of failures is something that's

3481
02:12:37,849 --> 02:12:39,050
great.

3482
02:12:40,051 --> 02:12:41,719
>> Tessa didn't really think I

3483
02:12:41,719 --> 02:12:43,154
want to make an app.

3484
02:12:43,154 --> 02:12:44,856
Tessa found a problem, a food
waste which you could use the

3485
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:48,059
app to help to solve.

3486
02:12:48,059 --> 02:12:49,927
>> Emma's grandma was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's.

3487
02:12:51,095 --> 02:12:52,430
She even forgot my daughter's

3488
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:53,564
birthday.

3489
02:12:53,564 --> 02:12:55,299
So Emma tried to search for an

3490
02:12:55,299 --> 02:12:56,067
app that would help,

3491
02:12:56,067 --> 02:12:57,068
but she couldn't find it.

3492
02:12:57,068 --> 02:13:00,104
So she said, you know, why don't

3493
02:13:00,104 --> 02:13:01,005
we just do it ourselves.

3494
02:13:01,005 --> 02:13:03,541
>> My husband was a diabetic.

3495
02:13:03,541 --> 02:13:07,045
That inspired Jeffrey to do

3496
02:13:07,045 --> 02:13:09,514
something about diabetes, and

3497
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:11,816
it's an answer to a lot of

3498
02:13:11,816 --> 02:13:14,085
people's prayers.

3499
02:13:15,053 --> 02:13:17,622
>> Jessie won the iPhone game of

3500
02:13:17,622 --> 02:13:18,456
the year.

3501
02:13:18,456 --> 02:13:19,323
I couldn't believe that he made

3502
02:13:19,323 --> 02:13:20,158
it.

3503
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:21,459
I mean to me it was remarkable.
>> She pulled out her cell

3504
02:13:22,427 --> 02:13:24,429
phone, and I saw his app on her

3505
02:13:24,429 --> 02:13:25,363
phone, and I was like trying not

3506
02:13:25,363 --> 02:13:27,498
to freak out, but oh my gosh.
>> For my wife, it's not just

3507
02:13:29,033 --> 02:13:31,002
creating, it's really wanting to

3508
02:13:31,002 --> 02:13:33,104
be a part of something big.

3509
02:13:33,104 --> 02:13:34,238
>> The one lesson that I learned

3510
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:35,440
from Jeremy every day is just
that determination, tenacity, to

3511
02:13:37,775 --> 02:13:38,609
focus.

3512
02:13:38,609 --> 02:13:40,478
He foresaw the impact that the

3513
02:13:40,478 --> 02:13:42,580
iPhone was going to have, and he

3514
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:43,681
bet everything on getting an app

3515
02:13:43,681 --> 02:13:44,515
for it,

3516
02:13:44,515 --> 02:13:45,483
and I think that it was one of

3517
02:13:45,483 --> 02:13:47,718
the most important things that

3518
02:13:47,718 --> 02:13:48,486
Yelp did.

3519
02:13:48,486 --> 02:13:50,855
>> I think he's made a big

3520
02:13:50,855 --> 02:13:52,323
difference, and so do thousands

3521
02:13:52,323 --> 02:13:53,624
of other people.
>> She wants to not just learn

3522
02:13:55,226 --> 02:13:58,396
also teach others and it makes

3523
02:13:58,396 --> 02:14:01,065
me really proud to see her

3524
02:14:01,065 --> 02:14:01,999
blossom.

3525
02:14:01,999 --> 02:14:03,367
>> As a parent, no better thing

3526
02:14:03,367 --> 02:14:04,335
is letting your kids do what

3527
02:14:04,335 --> 02:14:05,636
they want to do, because it

3528
02:14:05,636 --> 02:14:06,537
isn't how much money you've

3529
02:14:06,537 --> 02:14:07,371
made.

3530
02:14:07,371 --> 02:14:08,873
It's really changes you've left
behind.

3531
02:14:09,707 --> 02:14:11,309
And she's hoping to leave a lot

3532
02:14:11,309 --> 02:14:12,477
of change behind.
