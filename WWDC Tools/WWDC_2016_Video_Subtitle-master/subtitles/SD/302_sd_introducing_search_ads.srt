[ Music ]


2
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:22,486
>> Hello and welcome.


3
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,996
I'm Lindsay Verity,
and I'll be joined


4
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:27,386
by my colleagues Casey
Fictum and Eric Hall.


5
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,506
We're here to introduce
a new way


6
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:36,086
to help people discover
your apps in the App Store.


7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,156
If you've developed an app for
iOS, you know how much time,


8
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:44,136
effort and passion goes into
creating the playful, useful,


9
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:45,796
and wonderful apps
that people love.


10
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:49,406
Just like this year's
Apple Design Award winners.


11
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:53,196
You also know that putting
effort into putting awareness


12
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:55,806
and discoverability
of your app is just


13
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,876
as crucial to its success.


14
00:00:57,846 --> 00:00:59,876
And that's what we're here
to talk to you about today.


15
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,396
But before we do that,


16
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,226
let's review all the ways a user
can currently discover your app


17
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,056
in the App Store.


18
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:09,836
There's featured app collections
curated by our editors


19
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:13,866
that showcase the best apps
based on themes, interests,


20
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:16,966
and seasonal or cultural events.


21
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:20,806
Categories where
users can browse


22
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:23,066
and explore apps
on a deeper level.


23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:28,986
Top Charts, which list the
App Store's bestselling


24
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,556
or most downloaded apps and
games organized by paid,


25
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:34,526
free, and top-grossing.


26
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:39,686
And whilst editorial
features are an amazing way


27
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:42,166
to get a quick burst of
awareness in download activity


28
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,056
by users with over a
million and a half apps


29
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:48,376
in the U.S. App Store, the most
sustained source of downloads


30
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,976
for your app as if it shows up
for relevant search results.


31
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:56,826
Now the best way to
improve discoverability


32
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,006
and the likelihood a user
will tap on your listing


33
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,876
in App Store Search, is
to optimize the metadata


34
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,136
for your product page.


35
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:09,866
And show your app name,
imagery, description,


36
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,546
and keywords are highly
relevant and appealing.


37
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,866
This should be the prime
focus of your efforts


38
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:22,556
to support your app's
discoverability and downloads.


39
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:27,096
Last week, we announced Search
Ads, a powerful new way for you


40
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,436
to control the visibility
of your app


41
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:30,986
in App Store search results.


42
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,646
Search Ads can help develop
and drive new downloads


43
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:38,956
and increase usage
for your apps.


44
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,746
Almost two-thirds of all
app downloads come directly


45
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,046
from searches on the App Store.


46
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:49,676
The App Store is the place where
people can proactively look


47
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:52,586
for an app to download,
so there's no better place


48
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:56,366
to invest in the
promotion of your app.


49
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,356
When a user searches
in the App Store,


50
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:03,566
a single sponsored ad
may appear at the top


51
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,766
of the search results.


52
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,236
The sponsored listing will
have a blue background


53
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:10,716
and ad icon next to
the developer name.


54
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,826
The app may be in one of
the formats you see here,


55
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,766
optimized to what
we learn works best


56
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:22,006
for that search query and user.


57
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:25,976
Because user experience
is so important to us,


58
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:29,646
relevance is the main factor
determining whether your ad will


59
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:30,846
be showed for search query.


60
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:34,336
If your app is not relevant to
what the user is looking for,


61
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:36,996
it will not appear in
the ad spot regardless


62
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,576
of how much you may
be willing to pay.


63
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:40,986
Let me give you an example.


64
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:46,426
You have a pizza delivery app
and you bid on gaming searches


65
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,316
because you think those
hard-core gamers will get too


66
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,026
engrossed to actually
go out for pizza.


67
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:55,156
Well, your app most likely will
not make it into the auction


68
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:59,766
for those searches because
it is not a gaming app.


69
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:05,256
Now relevance will be determined
in some parts from the content


70
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:06,986
of your App Store metadata.


71
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:10,216
So as I mentioned earlier,
investing your time


72
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,536
in thoughtfully crafting
your app title, description,


73
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:17,046
and metadata with the most
relevant keywords will not only


74
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,555
improve your organic presence,


75
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,685
it will also improve
your relevance


76
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,776
for sponsored ads as well.


77
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,276
We also take users'
response to specific ads


78
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,636
as a signal for its relevance.


79
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:36,736
If users don't respond to an ad,
we'll stop showing it to them.


80
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,776
Pricing is a Cost Per Tap model.


81
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:42,646
So you only pay when a
user engages with your ad,


82
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:45,256
and you decide the maximum
amount you're willing


83
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,046
to pay for a tap.


84
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:51,036
The actual cost of
that tap is a result


85
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:52,406
of a Second Price Auction,


86
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:54,646
meaning the price
you pay is based


87
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:57,096
on what your nearest
competitor is willing to pay


88
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,776
to show their ad up
to your maximum bid.


89
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:02,956
This means you'll never pay more
than you're willing to spend


90
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:06,466
or more than you need to.


91
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:10,766
And whether your ad will
be shown is the combination


92
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:14,066
of your app's relevance to the
search query and the amount


93
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,226
of your bid comparative


94
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:16,996
to others bidding
on that same query.


95
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:19,406
And as I said earlier, apps


96
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:22,686
that aren't relevant won't
be entered into the auction.


97
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,616
With App Store Search being the
single most important source


98
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,506
of app downloads, our goal
in designing Search Ads was


99
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,166
to give all developers
the opportunity


100
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:40,916
to reach more customers through
greater control of your presence


101
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,146
in relevant search results.


102
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,966
Whether you have a
large budget or small,


103
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,656
have marketing expertise
or none at all.


104
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,586
I now invite Casey
to tell you more


105
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:52,056
about the features
we've designed


106
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:56,066
into the product
to do just that.


107
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,746
>> We've worked hard to make
Search Ad the great product


108
00:05:58,746 --> 00:05:59,716
for all developers.


109
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:02,376
But we really thought a lot
about how to make the experience


110
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,526
for smaller developers
as efficient


111
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:05,666
and as simple as possible.


112
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,516
So that way you can get back
to doing what you love to do,


113
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:09,916
which is creating great apps.


114
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:13,666
Search Ads was designed
to be smart and flexible


115
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,486
so that you can get
your ads up and running


116
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,506
in a matter of minutes.


117
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:19,806
And there are only a
few things that you need


118
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:22,006
to tell us before you can
get a campaign to go live.


119
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:24,526
And that is, your
app, your budget,


120
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,946
and your payment information.


121
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,206
And that's it.


122
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,596
So let's talk about
how this works.


123
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,836
You tell us the app that
you want to promote,


124
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:35,456
and Search Ads will
automatically create an ad


125
00:06:35,456 --> 00:06:37,956
for you using the
metadata and imagery


126
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:40,266
that you've already provided
in your App Store listing.


127
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:44,136
So there's actually nothing for
you to do here except make sure


128
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:47,006
that your App Store information
is the best representation


129
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,166
of your app.


130
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:52,156
Now because we know so much
about your app and a genre,


131
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:55,436
we can then take that ad and
match it to relevant queries


132
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,726
that are coming through
in the app store.


133
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:59,826
We do this with our default
on search match feature,


134
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:01,976
and we absolutely
love this feature.


135
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:05,316
We really think that
you will too.


136
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,986
Next you'll define your budget.


137
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,916
Your budget can include
a daily spend cap.


138
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,116
You'll also tell us the maximum
amount that you're willing


139
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,516
to pay for a tap on your ad.


140
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:19,256
Eric will talk about how to best
set your Max Cost per Tap later


141
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,186
on in the presentation.


142
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,776
Finally, you add your
payment information.


143
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:27,366
We support all of the currencies
that you see listed here


144
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,516
and except all major
credit cards.


145
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,166
And that's it.


146
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,776
Your ad is now eligible
to be up and running


147
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:36,056
in App Store Search results.


148
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:37,356
That's pretty simple.


149
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:42,676
Now we realize there are some of
you with more time or experience


150
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:43,936
when it comes to
search marketing,


151
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,396
and you may want more
control over your campaigns.


152
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,346
Now whether that be choosing
the particular keywords


153
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:52,176
that you want your ad to show
against, setting individual bits


154
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:54,766
for those keywords, or
just telling us more


155
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,366
about a particular
audience that you're trying


156
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,196
to reach with your ad.


157
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:59,126
Well, you can do all that.


158
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,816
Let's talk about keywords first.


159
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:05,286
Now because we know so much
about your app in a genre,


160
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:08,406
we can provide a list of
keyword recommendations to you


161
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:11,326
so that you don't have to think
about all of the possibilities.


162
00:08:12,356 --> 00:08:15,396
Furthermore, you can add
keyword ideas of your own,


163
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:20,426
and we'll give you a list of
keywords related to that input.


164
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:23,106
For all of our keywords,


165
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:26,866
we offer what we call a relative
search term popularity index.


166
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:28,746
And this just give
you a good idea


167
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:31,896
of how important a particular
keyword may be for your app


168
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:36,746
but also the relative
volume that it could drive.


169
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:39,035
We have two match
types for keywords.


170
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:43,015
There's Broad match, which
will match you to that keyword


171
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:47,076
as well as its relative variance
like synonyms and phrases


172
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:48,166
that include that keyword.


173
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:51,286
And then there's Exact
match which will target


174
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:54,266
that specific phrase as
well as its close variance


175
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,486
like common misspellings
and plurals.


176
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,226
If you want to learn
more about match types,


177
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,236
you should come talk to us


178
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,706
in our lab session tomorrow
morning, and we'll tell you all


179
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,126
about how these work
in our product.


180
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,476
Now you can keep
things simple here.


181
00:09:07,476 --> 00:09:10,786
And you could set a default bid
across all of your keywords,


182
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:14,216
or you can apply individual
bids at the keyword level


183
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:16,236
and that would be if you
want to further optimize


184
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,816
that keyword based on
things like its popularity


185
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:22,086
or just how important that
keyword is for your app.


186
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,526
There are also additional
targeting options available


187
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,976
to you if appropriate
for your app and goals.


188
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:32,506
Now our default setting is
to not show your ad to users


189
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,256
that have already
downloaded your app.


190
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:37,536
That way your budget can focus
on acquiring new downloads.


191
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,856
However, if your campaign
goals are different,


192
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:46,286
you can target existing users as
well as users of your other app.


193
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:49,226
If you want to further refine
your audience, we do allow you


194
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:52,436
to target by things like gender,
age, and device location.


195
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,426
So a very simple way to use
this feature would be let's say


196
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,466
that you have an app that
only services certain cities.


197
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,976
Well, you could target
by device location


198
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,776
and that way you wouldn't
be wasting budget in cities


199
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:06,966
that your app doesn't service.


200
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,506
Or perhaps there's an
age and gender group


201
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,806
that you know is your
most valuable customer.


202
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:16,116
Let's say males, ages 18 to 34.


203
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:18,506
Well, you could create
a discreet ad group


204
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:21,286
that would allow you to closely
manage the exposure and bids,


205
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:22,666
then, for that audience.


206
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:28,536
Now we obviously want you
to understand your return


207
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,916
on investment in Search Ads.


208
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,356
But we want that to be a very
clean and easy process for you.


209
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:37,216
So we designed an
intuitive campaign management


210
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,446
and reporting UI that will allow
you to get a quick overview


211
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:42,886
of what's happening,
as well as easily drill


212
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,976
down into the details
and management if needed.


213
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,766
Now the best place to
get a high-level overview


214
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:48,896
of performance is


215
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:51,586
on the campaign overview
page, which you see here.


216
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,886
And this is where we've trended
your most important metrics


217
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,046
in one very easy to digest page.


218
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,676
From here, you could hop
into the Keywords tab.


219
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:02,686
And you'll see we've
made it easy for you


220
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:03,966
to optimize those keywords


221
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:05,756
because we've placed
their key metrics


222
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,736
in the exact same place
that you manage them.


223
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:11,436
If you have bulk sets of
new keywords or negatives,


224
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,496
which would be the keywords
you don't want your ad


225
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:16,366
to show against, you can upload
those here via spreadsheet


226
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:16,706
as well.


227
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,206
Then there's the
Search Terms tab.


228
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,376
And this is a very powerful tab.


229
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:24,616
You could learn the actual
user search terms that have led


230
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:27,076
to an impression, tap,
or download for your ad.


231
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:28,416
So all the search queries


232
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,266
that your ad's been
matched to are shown here.


233
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,926
So anything from that Search
Match feature that I talked


234
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,026
about earlier will be
shown in this list.


235
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,516
And you'd also see search
queries that resulted


236
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,316
from your own Broad
match keywords.


237
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,596
So really it's just a great
place to discover new keywords.


238
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:48,626
Now these management screens
are ideal for taking actions


239
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:49,996
with performance
context and view.


240
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,246
But we've also built a
powerful reporting section


241
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:55,976
that allows you to parse
your campaigns, ad groups


242
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:58,326
and keywords by things
like demo,


243
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,096
location, device, and more.


244
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:03,696
You can download all of
this data to spreadsheets,


245
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:06,406
and we also offer
APIs for reporting,


246
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:08,226
campaign creation,
and management.


247
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:11,666
Once you've acquired a customer,


248
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:14,266
we offer a robust
attribution API


249
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:17,146
to give you advance insights,
including the ability


250
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:18,456
to understand the keywords


251
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,996
that are delivering the most
valuable customers to you.


252
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:23,046
That way you can
use that information


253
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,116
to optimize your bidding
strategies accordingly.


254
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:28,016
And now I'd like to invite Eric


255
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,386
to show you just how
effortless it is to create


256
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,246
and optimize a Search
Ads campaign


257
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:34,206
in our simple, yet powerful UI.


258
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,736
>> I'm going to share
with you how to set up


259
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:44,536
and manage a successful search
campaign in the App Store.


260
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:50,496
First, I search for my app
that I want to promote.


261
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:54,686
My app is LightRight, a new
camera app that specializes


262
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,726
in unique filters that aren't
available anywhere else.


263
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:02,386
Search Ads has found my app
and pulled in all my metadata,


264
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:07,056
which it will use to make my
campaign setup quick and easy.


265
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,996
Straight away I can see it has
automatically created my ad


266
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,776
for me, and I can
see a sample here.


267
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:17,636
The first thing I need
to do is name my campaign


268
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:18,726
and put in my budget.


269
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,146
My budget is $3,000.


270
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:25,706
I also have the option to
set a maximum daily spend.


271
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,766
I want to pace out my budget
to last for the quarter,


272
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,746
so I'll set it to $50.


273
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:36,596
Now I need to create
an ad group.


274
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,636
So I can organize my
bids and any keywords


275
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,416
or audience targeting
I want to add.


276
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:44,466
I'm going to call mine
LightRight Launch Group.


277
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:51,876
Because Search Ads knows
my app is a universal app,


278
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:55,086
it has defaulted my ads
to show for searches


279
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,746
on both the iPad and the iPhone.


280
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:02,946
I have the option to
choose just iPhone or iPad,


281
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,866
but I want to reach as
many people as possible,


282
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,326
so I'll leave it as is.


283
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:13,626
If appropriate, I can also
schedule my ad to start


284
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,546
and stop on specific dates.


285
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:19,516
The default setting is to
start today with no end date.


286
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:24,906
I can also choose to have my
ad show only on certain days


287
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,666
of the week or times of the day.


288
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:30,906
But for my LightRight App, I'd
like to be on the same schedule


289
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:33,996
as the App Store, 24/7.


290
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:38,946
Importantly, I need to set my
default max Cost Per Tap bid.


291
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:44,146
To work out how I should
set that for my campaign,


292
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:47,716
I take what I know an average
customer is worth to me


293
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:50,766
and decide how much
I can afford to spend


294
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,756
on acquiring each new customer.


295
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,986
I can afford to spend
about $2.50 per customer.


296
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:01,276
Given that searchers in the
App Store are high-intent


297
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,406
downloaders, I'm going to assume
on average that 40 percent


298
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:09,896
of the people who tap on my ad
will actually download my app.


299
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:14,066
Doing the math, that means I
can afford to pay 40 percent


300
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:18,366
of $2.50 per tap or $1.


301
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:23,976
So I'll set my starting
default max CPT bid to $1.


302
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,306
I have the option to
set a target cost per


303
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,176
acquisition goal.


304
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:38,446
Search Ads will use this
as a guide to work towards,


305
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,126
but it's not a guarantee.


306
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:44,366
If I set it too low, I
could be forgoing taps


307
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,766
that may lead to downloads.


308
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,806
For now, I'm not
going to set one


309
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:50,986
until I have some
learnings from my campaign.


310
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:56,426
Now I'm moving into defining
how my ads will get seen.


311
00:15:56,976 --> 00:16:00,106
Search Match is on by default,
and I'm going to leave it


312
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,966
on because as Casey mentioned,


313
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,106
Search Match will
automatically match my ad


314
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,106
to relevant user searches.


315
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:11,516
If I want to keep things simple,
I can just rely on Search Match


316
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,956
to do all of the work for me.


317
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:16,886
Because as I have time and
some previous experience


318
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:19,006
with search campaigns, I'm going


319
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:21,486
to see what keywords are
being recommended to me.


320
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:27,546
All of these look good, so I'm
going to go ahead and add them.


321
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:30,606
I can also see that some
of the recommendations


322
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,756
such as picture editor
look very popular.


323
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:37,936
I'll want to keep a
close eye on that one.


324
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:41,326
I also have a few keywords that
I'd like to add to my list.


325
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:46,056
As Casey mentioned,
when I use brackets,


326
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:48,936
then it's considered an
exact match and the rest


327
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:50,226
of the words are broad match.


328
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:56,056
So LightRight is an exact
match and color change


329
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,916
in light conditions
are broad match.


330
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,566
I have the option to
change the bids if I want.


331
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:03,826
But I plan to leave
them as-is for now.


332
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:09,406
Advanced targeting
offers me several options


333
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:12,675
to refine the audience
for my ad if appropriate


334
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:13,876
for my particular app.


335
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:18,036
The first default setting is
to show my ad only to users


336
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,266
who have not downloaded my app.


337
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,986
Other options, such as
reengaging my existing users are


338
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:26,136
also open to me.


339
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:30,686
But in my case, LightRight is a
new app, and I'm really focused


340
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:32,156
on acquiring new users.


341
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,226
So I'll go with the
default setting.


342
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:38,526
If appropriate, I could
also target my ads to show


343
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,426
to a specific gender or age.


344
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,926
For example, if your app is
a young women's fashion app,


345
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:48,446
then you may target female
ages between 18 and 34.


346
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:51,596
But for my LightRight
app all ages


347
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:55,186
and genders would be excited
to use my low-light filters,


348
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,716
so I'll skip the
demographic targeting.


349
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:03,256
Device location can be a
useful targeting option


350
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:06,786
if your app only serves a
specific geographical area.


351
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:10,756
For example, a food delivery
app that only serves the area


352
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,956
around San Francisco might
want to use this feature.


353
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:20,016
Now that I've set up my initial
campaign, let's fast forward


354
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,996
into the future and
see my campaign trends.


355
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:28,146
My average cost per tap at
86 cents is below my $1 max.


356
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:32,406
And my average cost per
acquisition is $2.34,


357
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,686
below my $2.50 target.


358
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:38,116
My average conversion rate
is on track at 40 percent.


359
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:41,126
At a high level, these
metrics look good.


360
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,456
But I notice my impressions,
taps,


361
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,776
and conversions have flattened


362
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:46,896
and are starting
to trend downward.


363
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:51,726
Given that my CPT and CPA
are below my expected values,


364
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,646
there may be opportunity for
me to win more impressions.


365
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,446
Let's drill down into
the search term view


366
00:18:57,446 --> 00:18:58,436
to see what's happening.


367
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:01,466
To get there, I click
on the Keyword tab


368
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:02,666
and then on Search Term.


369
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,436
The Search Term view is where I
can discover the actual search


370
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,226
terms that match to my ad
along with my key metrics


371
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,236
and their performance.


372
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,416
I can see here that
Search Match is matching me


373
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,206
to some really relevant terms


374
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,786
that are increasing
traffic to my app.


375
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:23,516
Color edit search term is
driving a lot of downloads


376
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:26,386
from my app at a
very efficient CPA.


377
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:28,836
I want to see if I can
get more impressions


378
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,076
if I raise my max CPT bid.


379
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:34,666
So I'm going to add it
as a broad match keyword.


380
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:47,986
I'm going to up my
max bid to $1.25.


381
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:54,466
Color search term,
on the other hand,


382
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,366
is driving very few
downloads and has a high CPA.


383
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:01,436
It's a broad match to
my color change keyword.


384
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:05,026
So I'm going to add it as a
negative exact match keyword


385
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:09,286
as people searching color are
not finding it too relevant


386
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:14,896
to my app.


387
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,246
Let's add color as a
negative campaign keyword.


388
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:22,206
To learn and manage
the performance


389
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:26,116
of the keywords I specifically
targeted, I need to hop


390
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:30,196
over to the Manage Keyword tab.


391
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:33,586
I see that app for lighting
has a low conversion rate


392
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:38,206
and the CPA at $5.17 is a
lot higher than my goal.


393
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:42,966
I'm going to pause the app
for lighting keyword for now.


394
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:52,556
I like the picture
editor keyword,


395
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,556
as that is performing
really well.


396
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:57,856
So I'm going to use
the Add Keywords tool


397
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,956
to get recommendations for
more keywords like this one.


398
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,646
So let's type in picture editor.


399
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,236
The photo editor
keyword is popular.


400
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,996
That should drive relevant
traffic to my LightRight app.


401
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:20,426
I'll add it to my
manage keywords.


402
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:24,666
And it will show up at
the top of the table.


403
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:30,226
The reporting view is a great
way to discover insights


404
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,706
about your campaigns
with various dimensions.


405
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:35,936
In my case, we're looking
at the distribution


406
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:38,416
of device class and impressions.


407
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:42,176
It seems that 80 percent
of users are searching


408
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,926
for my app from an iPhone.


409
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:47,256
Therefore, I should consider
creating an ad group specific


410
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:50,366
for iPhone so that I can
further refine my bids


411
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,706
to get more impressions
from iPhone users.


412
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:57,596
Now I'm driving users to my
app and generating downloads.


413
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,596
That's great.


414
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:00,376
But knowing the true value


415
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:03,406
of these downloads will help
me understand the full return


416
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:05,166
on my campaign investment.


417
00:22:05,886 --> 00:22:08,896
Because Search Ads, the App
Store, and the code I've used


418
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,646
to develop my app are all
part of the same ecosystem.


419
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:16,066
It's easy to know which of
my downloads were generated


420
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:16,946
by Search Ads.


421
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:20,636
The Search Ads attribution
API will not only attribute


422
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:24,476
downloads to my campaign, but
I can also attribute a download


423
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,346
to a specific bidded keyword
and the download date.


424
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:31,276
It's a turnkey solution that
makes it simple for me to create


425
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,766
and track meaningful
clusters of users


426
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:35,476
and their value to me over time.


427
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:38,636
This information will help
me determine which keywords


428
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,956
and other targeting parameters
work the best for my app.


429
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:43,896
And I can use those insights


430
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,156
to optimize my campaign
accordingly.


431
00:22:47,006 --> 00:22:50,006
The best part about the
attribution API is how easy it


432
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:50,906
is to instrument.


433
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,936
You just need the ad -- the I
Ad framework to your project


434
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:57,736
and then add these lines of
code to your application.


435
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,236
Here's the response object
from the attribution API


436
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:03,876
that contains campaign
hierarchy, details,


437
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,506
download date, and click date.


438
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,976
While the API allows
you to easily analyze


439
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,496
and segment your users, rest
assured that Apple does not sell


440
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:17,516
or transmit any personal
identifiable information


441
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:18,636
to any third parties.


442
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:22,046
We accomplish this by enabling
the information request


443
00:23:22,046 --> 00:23:26,476
and response on device
verifying the developer, user,


444
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,876
customer relationship
and allowing the user


445
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,236
to prevent information look


446
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:33,386
up by turning limited
ad tracking to on.


447
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:38,396
Now that you're armed with these
helpful tips, you'll be ready


448
00:23:38,396 --> 00:23:42,536
to set up and manage your
first search campaign.


449
00:23:43,526 --> 00:23:44,526
>> Thank you, Eric.

00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,686
You're going to love
this new way for users

to discover your amazing apps.


452
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,576
What could be better than the
opportunity for your app to show


453
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,566
up at the top of relevant
searches in the store


454
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:59,016
that millions of users are
proactively visiting every day?


455
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:04,466
And connecting those users
directly to download in one tap.


456
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:08,616
Setting up your Search Ad
campaign can be done in minutes.

and there's an intuitive
campaign management


460
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,726
and reporting UI
that enables you


461
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,306
to quickly view your results.


462
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:24,166
You're in control of how
much you want to spend.


463
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:27,296
And you have the option to
manage your own keywords,


464
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:31,406
refine your targeting, and
use our robust attribution API


465
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:33,166
for advanced insights.


466
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:39,866
We've talked about a
lot of things today.


467
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:42,986
But there are a few things
we've mentioned that you can do


468
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:46,036
to get prepared for Search Ads.


469
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:49,046
Firstly, optimize
your app metadata


470
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:51,536
and ensure it is
a highly relevant


471
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:56,556
and accurate reflection
of your content.


472
00:24:56,556 --> 00:24:58,266
Understand the value
of your customers


473
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,416
and how much you can
spend to acquire new ones.


474
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:05,456
This will help you determine
your maximum Cost Per Tap bid.


475
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,466
And lastly, implement
the attribution API code


476
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,136
in your app.


477
00:25:09,626 --> 00:25:12,606
You'll love the rich
data it can provide.
