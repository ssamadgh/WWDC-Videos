1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,703
Apple TV 4K takes
the living room experience


2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,405
to a whole new level,


3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:12,913
with support for 4K resolution,
P3 color, HDR video playback,


4
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:16,183
the incredible
A10X Fusion processor,


5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,986
and the updated and improved
Siri Remote.


6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,855
Updating your app to
support these new features


7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,191
is very straightforward.


8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,427
The first step is to
add a 2x launch image.


9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,264
Until you do so, tvOS
is going to run your app


10
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,198
in compatibility mode.


11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,869
While you're at it, you'll also
want to add 2x app icons


12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,738
and top shelf images.


13
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,542
When attached to
a 4K television,


14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,579
UIKit will now automatically
select retina assets


15
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,648
from your asset catalogue.


16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,786
You can inspect what screen
scale the device is running in


17
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,823
by inspecting the scale property
of the main UIScreen.


18
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,092
You can also determine
the pixel resolution


19
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,030
of the attached display by using
the nativeBounds property.


20
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,969
Just like the latest iOS
and macOS devices,


21
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,371
we're really excited
that Apple TV 4K


22
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,774
now supports P3 color.


23
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,342
When providing retina assets,


24
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,277
you may also want to
update your assets


25
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,147
to take advantage of
this wider color space,


26
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,182
allowing your graphics
and images to contain


27
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,686
even richer and more saturated
colors than before.


28
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,621
This isn't just for flat images


29
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,324
but is supported for
layered images as well.


30
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,495
Media apps will also want to
look at updating their streams


31
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,764
to include 4K and HDR variants


32
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,435
for any content that was
produced in these formats.


33
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,138
Apple TV 4K supports
both Dolby Vision and HDR10


34
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,407
for HDR content,


35
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,643
and the addition of support
for HEVC


36
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,779
enables these higher fidelity
and resolution streams


37
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,082
while consuming up to
40 percent less bandwidth


38
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:58,452
than comparable streams
encoded using H.264.


39
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,989
The updated and improved
Siri Remote


40
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:05,158
now provides motion data
for attitude and rotation rate,


41
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,728
in addition to the values
for acceleration and gravity


42
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,030
that the prior version offered.


43
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,967
To determine if
the paired remote


44
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,637
supports these new features,
you can inspect the new GCMotion


45
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,507
"hasAttitudeAndRotationRate"
property.


46
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,709
The values for attitude
and rotation rate


47
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,279
are then provided by the
respective GCMotion properties.


48
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,950
And with those few changes,


49
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,818
you're going to be able to
take advantage


50
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,490
of all of the new capabilities
and performance of Apple TV 4K.


51
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,796
