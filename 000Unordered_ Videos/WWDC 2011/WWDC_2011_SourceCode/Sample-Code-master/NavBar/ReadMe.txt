NavBar

Demonstrates how to use UINavigationController and UIViewController classes together as building blocks to your application's user interface.  Use it as a launching pad in starting the development of your new application.  The various pages in this sample exhibit different ways in how to modify the navigation bar by modifying the navigation controller's UINavigationItem.  This class represents the navigation bar at the top of the screen.  Among the levels of customization are varying appearance styles known as UIBarStyle, and applying custom left and right buttons known as UIBarButtonItems.

In addition, this sample shows a technique in how to manage multiple nib files on one application.  Each page or UIViewController contains its own nib and is loaded using:

	- (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil;

Build Requirements
iOS 5.0 SDK

Runtime Requirements
iOS 4.0 or later

Using the Sample
Build and run the sample using Xcode 3.1. To run in the simulator, set the Active SDK to Simulator. To run on a device, set the Active SDK to the appropriate Device setting.

Bar Style
Click the "Style" button to the left of the main page to change the navigation bar's style or UIBarStyle.   This will take you to an action sheet where you can change the background's appearance (default, black-opaque, or black-translucent).

View One
This page adds a titled UIButton of type UIButtonTypeNavigation to the right button view of the navigation bar.

View Two
