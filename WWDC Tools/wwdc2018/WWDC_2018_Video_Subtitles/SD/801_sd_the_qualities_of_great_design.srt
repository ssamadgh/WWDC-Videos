[ Applause ]


3
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:32,235
>> Hello. Hi, I'm really excited


4
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:33,746
to be here to talk to you today


5
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:35,316
about The Qualities of Great


6
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:35,866
Design.


7
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,156
My name is Lauren Strehlow, and


8
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,996
I'm a design evangelist here at


9
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:40,316
Apple.


10
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:42,956
The evangelism team, our number


11
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:44,886
one goal is to help developers


12
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,896
just like you create great apps.


13
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:50,106
And a big part of my job is


14
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:51,596
actually to work with the design


15
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,096
presenters who are putting on


16
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:54,326
all of the awesome design


17
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:55,566
session content that you see


18
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:57,376
here at the conference.


19
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,876
So when I started to work with


20
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:02,696
potential presenters this year


21
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,616
about their talks, this theme of


22
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,886
quality kept coming up, but


23
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:09,646
nobody was talking about it head


24
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:12,276
on, so I decided to.


25
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,426
But I went about it a little bit


26
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:14,906
differently.


27
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,576
I decided to talk to great


28
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:18,806
designers from our developer


29
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,896
community, such as the creative


30
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:23,456
director at The Game Band.


31
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:27,376
I also talked to the cofounders


32
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,866
of the Layers Conference, which


33
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,756
is actually happening right now


34
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:31,616
across the street.


35
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,626
And I talked to the VP of Design


36
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:35,716
at Khan Academy.


37
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:37,836
I also talked to some of my


38
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,416
great colleagues here at Apple


39
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,426
who work in a wide variety of


40
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:42,326
design disciplines.


41
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:46,656
They work in type design, sound


42
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:49,576
design, motion, visual, and


43
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:50,516
interaction design.


44
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:53,976
These are all real people who I


45
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:57,246
truly admire and respect, and I


46
00:01:57,246 --> 00:01:58,836
think they have created great


47
00:01:58,966 --> 00:01:59,976
apps and games that have


48
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,186
tremendous caliber.


49
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:03,926
So I conducted a series of


50
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:04,416
interviews.


51
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:07,286
I talked to 13 people, and I


52
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:09,506
asked them a ton of questions to


53
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:11,446
discover what quality means to


54
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:13,796
them, what challenges they face,


55
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,106
and what they do to strive for


56
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,346
excellence in design.


57
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,836
So before you think any of this


58
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,086
is scripted, I actually didn't


59
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,666
give anybody these questions in


60
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,066
advance.


61
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:26,946
So everything you're about to


62
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,986
hear today is real reactions to


63
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:30,756
these questions.


64
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,026
I collected over 15 hours of


65
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,396
interview footage, and I've


66
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,596
distilled it down to the very


67
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:39,246
essence of these responses.


68
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:41,826
So the audio clips you're about


69
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,006
to hear today represent what I


70
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,276
discovered about quality in


71
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:47,156
great design.


72
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:50,196
So today, we're going to dig


73
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:51,826
into interpretations of quality


74
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:53,916
and how it influences our


75
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:55,506
perceptions and design


76
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:56,046
directions.


77
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,736
We're also going to talk about


78
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,486
its effect on people's lives.


79
00:03:02,086 --> 00:03:03,056
[laughs] Actually, this is


80
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:03,946
really exciting because it


81
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:05,456
turned out to be so much more


82
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,566
than what I expected.


83
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,286
We're also going to hear about


84
00:03:09,586 --> 00:03:11,176
aspirations from the designers


85
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:13,066
that I interviewed, to hear what


86
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,576
drives them, what goals they


87
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:15,856
have when they're striving for


88
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:17,886
quality, even if those goals


89
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:18,936
seem unattainable.


90
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,746
And finally, I want to share


91
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:23,306
some techniques that were


92
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:25,176
revealed while asking people


93
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:26,526
about their experiences.


94
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,446
And I hope that these techniques


95
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,156
can help you approach the


96
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,946
challenge of designing for a lot


97
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:32,396
of people.


98
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,496
So this session is all about the


99
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:37,086
qualities of great design


100
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,036
defined by designers.


101
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,396
So let's kick things off, and


102
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:45,426
get started, and hear a few


103
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:49,046
answers to this one simple


104
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:52,516
question: What is quality?


105
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,796
>> Quality is nothing else than


106
00:03:55,796 --> 00:04:00,486
what we agree upon is good.


107
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,796
>> If something is quality, it


108
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,906
implies that there is nothing


109
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,486
random about it.


110
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,916
>> The number one thing is just


111
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,476
that something with a lot of


112
00:04:13,476 --> 00:04:18,206
care and time went into it.


113
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:19,366
>> It's one of those things that


114
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,826
people can feel it when they


115
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,276
feel it, and it's very hard for


116
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:25,006
them to put their finger on it.


117
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:25,336
>> All right.


118
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:27,816
This one I can really relate to.


119
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,916
I'm totally a feeler, and so


120
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,726
this naturally led me to ask a


121
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:34,366
follow-on question: What does


122
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:36,326
quality feel like?


123
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:38,656
>> Does it feel like somebody


124
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:39,866
has thought of you already and


125
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,016
all the things that you need are


126
00:04:41,016 --> 00:04:42,286
easy to get to and very


127
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:42,946
understandable?


128
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:46,426
>> I think that when I'm


129
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:47,966
thinking about things that are


130
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,626
quality or handling things that


131
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:52,176
are quality, it's things that


132
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,566
aren't painful to use in any


133
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:55,676
way, which could be, like,


134
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,556
mentally painful, physically


135
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,766
painful, emotionally painful,


136
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:01,996
things that don't make me feel


137
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:04,266
uncomfortable, or dumb, or


138
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:05,976
[laughs] or inconvenienced.


139
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:09,156
>> If you just launch the app


140
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,036
and you feel, as you use it, oh,


141
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:12,686
well, this feels like


142
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,666
state-of-the-art technology that


143
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,366
I'm using.


144
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,836
This feels like it's easier for


145
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,136
me to get things done.


146
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,706
I feel more productive.


147
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,136
I feel like I'm able to achieve


148
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:21,996
better results.


149
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:25,716
>> All the concentration that


150
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,636
you're building up goes to the


151
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:28,806
task at hand, the thing that you


152
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:29,636
actually want to do.


153
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,236
And that to me feels like


154
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:31,746
quality.


155
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:32,966
If you're able to achieve that,


156
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,936
and people can be very creative,


157
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,526
and make beautiful things, or


158
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,536
have special moments through a


159
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:41,096
device -- for example, by taking


160
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:42,456
really good pictures, or sharing


161
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:44,166
pictures with friends, or


162
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,696
finding the right music to play


163
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,576
at the right moment, or, you


164
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:48,696
know, doing fun stuff with


165
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,876
FaceTime, and seeing people on


166
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:50,746
the other side of the world that


167
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:51,676
you haven't seen in a long time


168
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:53,206
-- all of that is very special.


169
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:55,376
And again, none of that is


170
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,686
around the UI that you're doing.


171
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,656
None of that is about what


172
00:05:58,656 --> 00:05:59,986
interaction you chose to do that


173
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:00,276
stuff.


174
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:01,736
That should all be obvious, and


175
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,856
blatantly unspoken, and just


176
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:08,056
completely in the background.


177
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:11,296
>> Wow. I just love that, that


178
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:13,186
quality isn't about the UI or


179
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,156
interactions, that it's about


180
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:16,606
the moment, the people.


181
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:18,356
You know, these are the people


182
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:20,686
that you're designing for, and


183
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:21,806
you're helping them create


184
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,896
memories and share those moments


185
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:24,396
with others.


186
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:27,026
That is what this is all about.


187
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:30,036
So how do you design for that?


188
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,016
Well, I actually asked that


189
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,546
question.


190
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:34,626
>> It's hard.


191
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:37,516
>> [laughter] Yeah.


192
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:39,456
I hope you weren't actually


193
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:40,826
hoping for a real answer here.


194
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,386
It's definitely very hard, and


195
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,186
we have 55 minutes to dig into


196
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:44,486
why.


197
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,396
So we just heard a ton of


198
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,386
answers to this question, what


199
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:51,426
is quality?


200
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:54,436
We heard that it is what we


201
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:58,886
agree upon is good, that it's


202
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,746
not random, it's something that


203
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:04,816
shows a lot of care and time


204
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:07,796
went into it, and it feels like


205
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:08,906
somebody has thought of you


206
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:09,416
already.


207
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,216
It can also be not painful in


208
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,416
any way, and it feels state of


209
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:16,846
the art.


210
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:19,446
Quality things make it easier to


211
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:20,346
get things done.


212
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,596
And finally, your concentration


213
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:24,726
goes to the thing that you


214
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,086
really want to do, like sharing


215
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:28,666
that picture or playing your


216
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,426
favorite song.


217
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:33,216
So by asking about quality, it


218
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:34,906
resulted in many different


219
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:37,296
answers, but what's so great


220
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:39,196
about that is that it reflects


221
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,776
what each one of these people


222
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:41,926
truly care about.


223
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,086
And of course, people care about


224
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,126
different things, so it makes


225
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,396
complete sense that they all


226
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,046
have different interpretations


227
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,586
of what quality is when it


228
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,166
applies to apps and games.


229
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,766
So we have a lot to get to


230
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,206
today, but I really want to dig


231
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,126
into just a couple of these


232
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:00,776
responses.


233
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:02,566
I think they're all great, but


234
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,096
let's just dig into this first


235
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:04,556
one here.


236
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,386
And we're going to listen to the


237
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,586
clip one more time.


238
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,076
>> If something is quality, it


239
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,186
implies that there is nothing


240
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:14,856
random about it.


241
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,026
>> During this interview with


242
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,446
Nicole, she explained that not


243
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:22,056
random to her meant not slapped


244
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:22,676
together.


245
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,436
And she used this word


246
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:25,646
"considered."


247
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,356
Great designs are considered.


248
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,716
They're organized, and they show


249
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:31,986
a thought process has taken


250
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:32,456
place.


251
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:33,876
And what I found really


252
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,285
interesting is that she said


253
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:36,926
that that's really visible to


254
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:39,216
people, that that visibility of


255
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:40,826
quality in design actually came


256
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:42,506
up in another interview when I


257
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:43,456
was talking with Mike.


258
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,646
>> I guess this is probably a


259
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:48,306
little cliché sounding, but


260
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:49,846
it's often the little things


261
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,106
that are the telltale signs


262
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:52,776
about craftsmanship.


263
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:54,286
>> Okay, we have to pause right


264
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:55,426
there because we're about to


265
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:57,136
talk about craft in a design


266
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,266
session, and Mike already called


267
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:00,376
it out that it's a little


268
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:03,296
cliché, but before we listen to


269
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,136
the rest of this clip, I need


270
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,286
you to imagine that you're in


271
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,606
the audio booth with us.


272
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:10,566
There's not going to be anything


273
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,106
on screen, so I want you to


274
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:14,216
really focus on the words that


275
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:15,346
Mike is about to say.


276
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:19,016
Okay, here we go.


277
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,196
>> We're sitting in this room


278
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:22,666
here, and there's these panels


279
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,586
on the wall, and the panels have


280
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,006
a little bit of a gap between


281
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:26,096
them.


282
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,516
And we can look at the width of


283
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:31,376
the gap as you look from the top


284
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:33,186
of the wall to the bottom of the


285
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:33,556
wall.


286
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:36,126
And if there's variable


287
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,836
separation or variable width of


288
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:39,816
that gap, you just get the sense


289
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,076
that it wasn't well crafted.


290
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,876
>> Right. So really, while Mike


291
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,836
was talking about those variable


292
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:50,606
widths in the gaps of the panels


293
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:52,866
in the audio booth, you know, I


294
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,316
understood that he's saying that


295
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,716
those details are visible, and


296
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:58,116
they matter a lot.


297
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,626
And it's through consideration


298
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,836
and being really deliberate, and


299
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,286
thinking through every single


300
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,406
detail thoughtfully, well, that


301
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:06,926
shows.


302
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:09,386
And so being really into your


303
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,806
craft here is the point because


304
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:13,426
the best things that we love are


305
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,376
not random.


306
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:15,956
They're not slapped together.


307
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,846
They're intentional through


308
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:18,786
every detail.


309
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,266
And if you can do that, that's


310
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:21,916
quality.


311
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,316
So let's explore one more answer


312
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:26,816
to the question, what is


313
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:28,366
quality, and listen to the clip


314
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:28,876
again.


315
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,996
>> The number one thing is just


316
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,556
that something with a lot of


317
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:37,016
care and time went into it.


318
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:39,736
>> This one in particular really


319
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,166
resonated with me because when


320
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,386
you're writing questions to


321
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:44,836
interviews like, what is


322
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,736
quality, you naturally end up


323
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,266
asking yourself, and to me,


324
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,406
quality is all about care.


325
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:53,846
So when I heard care connected


326
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:55,496
to quality not only from that


327
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:57,006
clip we just heard from Travis,


328
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,306
but it also came up in my


329
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:00,326
interview with Gary.


330
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:03,576
>> If it's quality, it's better


331
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:04,536
than something that's not


332
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:06,156
quality by virtue of someone


333
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,086
caring about it.


334
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:10,616
>> Right. I totally agree that


335
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,976
caring makes things better.


336
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,476
For example, I care about this


337
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,676
presentation, so, naturally,


338
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,216
it's just a little bit better


339
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:19,676
than if I didn't care about it


340
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:19,946
at all.


341
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,726
So now, I feel like we should


342
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:24,966
dig into, what is care?


343
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,306
Okay, we're going to stick with


344
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:28,896
a few interview clips from Gary


345
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,726
so you can hear more of the full


346
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:31,576
conversation.


347
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:34,286
So I asked him, "How would you


348
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:35,716
describe care?"


349
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:40,896
>> Just that someone, excuse my


350
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:42,886
French, gave a [beep].


351
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:44,796
>> [laughter] I'm not sure if


352
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:46,436
that's a WWDC first, but it's


353
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:47,016
simple.


354
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:47,826
I like it.


355
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:49,706
[laughs] Really, what he's


356
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:52,596
saying here is that care is a


357
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:53,316
motivator.


358
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:56,666
So how do you look at care in


359
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,196
design?


360
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,366
>> I look at it from 2 lenses of


361
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:00,666
care.


362
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,056
Did I care enough to make it the


363
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:02,706
best it could be?


364
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:04,716
But do I also care about what


365
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:05,816
your experience is?


366
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,006
Be it you.


367
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,196
Be it my mum.


368
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,536
Be it my next-door neighbor.


369
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,436
Be it anybody around the world.


370
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:12,836
You have to kind of, sort of


371
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:13,946
take yourself out of the


372
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,266
equation, put yourself in their


373
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,206
shoes so you can be sure that


374
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,516
their experience is a quality


375
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:19,216
experience.


376
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:20,956
So you have to care enough to do


377
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:21,246
that.


378
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:22,776
It's not just about caring about


379
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,026
your own sense of, "Oh, I like


380
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:27,336
my design, and I cared enough to


381
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:28,726
make it good for me."


382
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,946
It's about it being good for as


383
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,056
many people as possible or for


384
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,326
the target audience, if it


385
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:35,526
happens to be a more narrowly


386
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,176
focused thing.


387
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:40,326
>> Right. So when I heard this,


388
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,836
I was just, I wanted to know


389
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,426
how, immediately.


390
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,276
How do you design that


391
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:47,156
experience for others, and how


392
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,076
do you know when you've made


393
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:48,496
progress?


394
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:51,846
>> I think sometimes we look at


395
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,256
a tangled mess of problems that


396
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:55,466
we need to solve, and if, at the


397
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,006
end, you can look at the result


398
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,906
and go, that is so much better,


399
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,196
and if it came easy, it wouldn't


400
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,786
be as fun, but the fact that you


401
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:05,126
sweated over it, that you really


402
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,216
worked hard at it, that it gave


403
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,636
you sleepless nights, that you


404
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:10,726
poured late nights and weekends


405
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:12,346
into solving those problems,


406
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:13,766
combined effort, team effort,


407
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:16,606
the end result is so much more


408
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:17,266
satisfying.


409
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:19,826
I love it when we work hard and


410
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:22,906
get there more than when ideas


411
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,286
just come easily.


412
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:25,816
I worry that we've actually


413
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:27,136
missed something by not working


414
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:27,436
hard.


415
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,416
If it's too easy, we've become


416
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,076
complacent, and I don't think


417
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,866
you get anywhere rewarding


418
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:36,256
without doing hard work.


419
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:37,466
>> I really understood this


420
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:40,396
point about working hard after


421
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,806
Gary related this to mountain


422
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:43,226
biking.


423
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:45,176
We talked about this for a


424
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:46,766
while, so I'm just going to


425
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:48,126
summarize that conversation here


426
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:48,766
for you today.


427
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,186
Essentially, you have to work


428
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,456
really hard to get to the top of


429
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,316
the mountain, and then you can


430
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:56,896
have a ton of fun on the


431
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:57,286
descent.


432
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:59,666
Now, it's not as much fun if you


433
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,626
just started at the top and went


434
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:04,276
down because it's really all of


435
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,996
that time, and effort, and sweat


436
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,186
that brings you to the top of


437
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:10,486
the mountain that makes the view


438
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,176
all that more beautiful and


439
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:14,326
makes the ride down so much more


440
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:16,136
fun.


441
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:21,466
So in life, care naturally gives


442
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,216
more time and effort because you


443
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:25,926
have a passion to achieve your


444
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,896
goals, and you'll do whatever is


445
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:29,066
needed to meet your own


446
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:29,976
expectations.


447
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,626
And yeah, that's totally a lot


448
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:35,216
of work, but that hard work has


449
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:37,176
a payoff, and it's really


450
00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:37,986
satisfying.


451
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,326
And the payoff, well, that's why


452
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,566
you did it in the first place,


453
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:41,816
right?


454
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:44,766
You have a goal, and you make it


455
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:45,226
happen.


456
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:46,876
That's just awesome.


457
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:51,076
So quality is all about care,


458
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,456
and because you care, you're


459
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,316
going to put in that time and


460
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,846
effort to make things great.


461
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:00,706
And that's just one answer to


462
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,766
the question, what is quality?


463
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:05,386
And because there are so many


464
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,526
different interpretations of


465
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:09,596
quality, well, that means it's


466
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:11,396
just really hard to achieve.


467
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:13,466
A little bit later, we're going


468
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,186
to get into some techniques to


469
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,726
hopefully help make the process


470
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:17,626
of designing a little bit


471
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:18,206
easier.


472
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:20,396
But for now, let's just recap


473
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,196
what we've learned.


474
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:24,966
So far, just by asking a few


475
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,056
simple questions, we've learned


476
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,536
that quality means something


477
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:30,766
different to different people,


478
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:34,896
that it's not random -- it is


479
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:36,486
crafted and considered.


480
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,196
Quality is the result of time,


481
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:41,546
effort, and care.


482
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:45,836
And it is just hard to achieve,


483
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,916
but that's okay.


484
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,556
Quality has many different


485
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:51,476
interpretations.


486
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,236
What is yours?


487
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:56,036
I think this is really important


488
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:58,106
to ask yourself, what is


489
00:15:58,146 --> 00:15:59,356
quality, and what does it mean


490
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,236
to you, and what does it mean to


491
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:03,436
your app or game, because that's


492
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,206
going to reveal what you truly


493
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,716
care about, and that's going to


494
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,066
help you focus on what you're


495
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,566
working towards going forward.


496
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:13,736
So let's just pause here for a


497
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:15,106
moment, and we actually need to


498
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:16,596
go back a bit.


499
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:17,716
Why does quality matter in the


500
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:18,356
first place?


501
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,096
Why are we even talking about it


502
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:21,706
here at WWDC?


503
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:24,936
Well, what's the significance?


504
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:28,346
Let's just ask, why is quality


505
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:29,196
important?


506
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:34,086
>> Quality impacts the world


507
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:36,086
that we interact with in so many


508
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:37,326
different ways all the time


509
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,736
throughout our day.


510
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,826
>> Yeah. Travis is totally


511
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:41,986
right.


512
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,826
Throughout our day, there are


513
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,466
things that we eat, drink, wear,


514
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,186
I mean, even the air we breathe.


515
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:50,826
They all have some level of


516
00:16:50,826 --> 00:16:52,396
quality that impacts us.


517
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,706
And we expect quality in our


518
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,686
friendships, in our family, in


519
00:16:57,686 --> 00:16:58,616
our relationships.


520
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:01,046
We seek out people who show us


521
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,106
respect, who care about us and


522
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:03,786
make us feel good.


523
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:06,185
I mean, nobody keeps around


524
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:07,286
poor-quality friends.


525
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,786
We also expect quality from the


526
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:11,516
products that we use and the


527
00:17:11,516 --> 00:17:12,986
things that we use every day.


528
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,256
We expect them not to break.


529
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:18,056
And if they do break, well, we


530
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:19,286
tend to think that they're cheap


531
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,026
and not well made, and we


532
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,215
typically won't buy them again.


533
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,906
So yeah, the concept of quality


534
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:30,686
impacts our every day, and it's


535
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:32,036
really in everything.


536
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:34,826
While it's really wide reaching


537
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:36,786
and broad, there seems to be


538
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,226
something so special about


539
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,156
quality, but what is it?


540
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,176
What makes quality special?


541
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,116
>> They say, like, oh, I cooked


542
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,816
this with love, and it can just


543
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:49,966
be eggs or whatever, but it does


544
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:52,196
taste different, and I think


545
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,326
Jessie and I like to think that


546
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,256
whatever we do, that sort of


547
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:57,686
love for what we're doing comes


548
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:58,516
through.


549
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,136
>> Right? I know these two


550
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:02,946
ladies absolutely love what they


551
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,556
do, and I know I can feel it


552
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:07,046
when someone really loves


553
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:07,676
something.


554
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,356
And to Elaine's first point, you


555
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,376
know, I think everyone here


556
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:13,566
knows that Mom and Dad's food


557
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:15,266
just tastes a little bit better


558
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,696
because it's made with that care


559
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:18,336
and love.


560
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,726
So what really Elaine means by


561
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,416
this is your intentions are


562
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:24,706
felt.


563
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,296
So if your intention is to


564
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,416
create something great and you


565
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,086
do everything you need to do to


566
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,716
achieve that, people are going


567
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:33,216
to know.


568
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:35,586
They're going to feel it.


569
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:36,856
And the reverse is true too.


570
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:38,916
You know, if you rushed and you


571
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,206
didn't really care about the


572
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,656
look of settings in your app UI,


573
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,476
well, it's going to impact the


574
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:46,946
overall feeling that people have


575
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,406
about your app.


576
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:52,016
So throughout the course of


577
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:53,906
conducting these interviews, I


578
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:54,986
started to see the word


579
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:57,236
"quality" everywhere, like


580
00:18:57,726 --> 00:19:00,426
quality coffee or quality meats.


581
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,826
And even one night when I was


582
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:03,936
working really late, and I


583
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,366
ordered a pizza, and the pizza


584
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,566
box said, "Our commitment is


585
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:08,286
quality."


586
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:11,106
[laughs] So I see the word


587
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,346
everywhere now.


588
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,516
It's really pervasive, from


589
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,746
signs to badges, to labels.


590
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,246
So I brought this up in a few of


591
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:21,106
the interviews, not because I


592
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,236
wanted to know what people


593
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:23,866
thought of labeling, but,


594
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,886
instead, to ask, why do we tend


595
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,866
to be drawn towards things that


596
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:29,606
are quality?


597
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:34,066
>> Well, survival instinct at


598
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:34,556
its root.


599
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:36,536
On a more deep level, I guess,


600
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:37,806
why do we desire quality?


601
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:39,826
We desire quality because we


602
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:40,406
want to live.


603
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:44,096
And a good survival strategy for


604
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,626
living is to put things into our


605
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:50,296
body, to eat things, or to wear


606
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,066
things, or to drive in things,


607
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,396
or to live in things that are


608
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:56,936
safe and have been well


609
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:59,036
constructed so they aren't going


610
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:00,936
to cause us bodily harm.


611
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,906
And so I think purely on a


612
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:07,236
survival level, quality is a


613
00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:08,986
very important concept for us.


614
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:10,376
It's a very important attribute


615
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,666
that we seek in everything.


616
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,356
>> Mike explained a bit further


617
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:17,336
during this interview.


618
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:18,996
We were talking about this


619
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:22,356
fictitious butcher shop, and if


620
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,296
we were in this shop, quality


621
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,886
would be communicated not only


622
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:28,266
by the products itself, but also


623
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,706
the shop being really clean and


624
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:31,946
interacting with the really nice


625
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:33,146
people that work there.


626
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,246
Every facet of the entire


627
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:38,776
experience would meet your


628
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,436
expectations, [laughs] and it


629
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:42,506
would also be connected to that


630
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:44,216
proposition of quality.


631
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:48,266
And that evokes trust.


632
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:51,296
Trust comes from products


633
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,906
upholding their promise, and


634
00:20:53,906 --> 00:20:56,046
that quality experience is far


635
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,956
more important than any label


636
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,046
because I am definitely not


637
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:02,986
suggesting that you add a label


638
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:04,996
to your apps because you


639
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,266
[laughs] definitely don't need


640
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:07,426
to.


641
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:10,046
Every facet of your app


642
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,496
experience, from the screenshots


643
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:14,006
on the App Store to the


644
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,596
description, to how you respond


645
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:19,196
to customer reviews, all through


646
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,716
to your app's interface, these


647
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,396
experiences, these interactions


648
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:25,296
that you have with people, that


649
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,566
communicates the quality about


650
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:28,996
your app or your game.


651
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,556
And you don't want a label


652
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,166
anyway.


653
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:33,316
Why?


654
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,436
>> In a way, it's like saying


655
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:38,226
you're cool.


656
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:41,476
Like, being cool doesn't involve


657
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:42,786
saying you're cool.


658
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:46,396
[laughs] And, you know, you only


659
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:48,096
say that someone else is cool.


660
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:49,986
It's only something which can be


661
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:51,626
sort of determined by an outside


662
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:52,486
party, in a way.


663
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:56,146
And even then, there's a certain


664
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:57,196
context where it feels more


665
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,316
appropriate than others.


666
00:21:58,316 --> 00:21:59,396
Like, if we're talking about


667
00:21:59,816 --> 00:22:01,976
Thelonious Monk and we're just


668
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,576
talking about jazz in the '50's,


669
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,806
like, that's cool.


670
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,546
That's the birth of cool, right.


671
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:08,476
[laughs] That's where it's,


672
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,296
like, totally appropriate to use


673
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,586
that kind of term, but that's an


674
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:14,776
earned coolness.


675
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,146
And so quality has to be earned.


676
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:19,926
>> I think Mike makes a really


677
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:20,386
good point.


678
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,126
So the significance of quality


679
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:24,916
is massive.


680
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:27,416
As we heard, it impacts our


681
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:30,356
every day, it can be felt, and


682
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,306
it evokes trust in the people


683
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,906
that are using your app.


684
00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:35,686
All right.


685
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,046
Now, everyone I talked to


686
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:39,996
throughout these interviews,


687
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:42,066
they all have a passion for


688
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,986
excellence, so we're going to


689
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:45,606
talk about four design


690
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,706
aspirations, and these four


691
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:49,366
aspirations really stood out to


692
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,116
me because, well, they seemed


693
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,306
just so incredibly elusive and


694
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:54,186
hard to achieve.


695
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:57,776
But these designers use them as


696
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,046
motivation to strive for quality


697
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,866
in their work, and these


698
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:04,116
aspirations are to design things


699
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:07,846
that are simple, stunning,


700
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:12,746
timeless, and leave a positive


701
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:13,916
impact on people's lives.


702
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:16,326
So we're going to dig into each


703
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:18,246
one of these to discover why


704
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,536
they're important and also how


705
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:22,066
they provide motivation to


706
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,236
create great design.


707
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:25,246
All right.


708
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:27,586
Let's start with simplicity.


709
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:30,846
This came up in response to this


710
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:33,306
question: What makes a great


711
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,576
app?


712
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:36,206
>> It's simple.


713
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,566
It doesn't try to do more than


714
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:39,466
it needs to do.


715
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:40,996
And what it does, it does it


716
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:41,676
really well.


717
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:44,226
>> I don't know about you, but I


718
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:45,696
have heard that a lot.


719
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:47,896
[laughs] So I'm sure you've


720
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:48,846
heard it before too.


721
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,246
But there's got to be a reason


722
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,206
why that phrase is on repeat,


723
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:56,036
and I was really thinking about


724
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:57,166
this after the interview.


725
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,686
You know, why should apps be


726
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:01,106
simple, and why is that a good


727
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:01,476
thing?


728
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,926
Well, it finally clicked for me


729
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:05,176
one day after work.


730
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:08,006
I got home, I needed to cook


731
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:09,736
some dinner, and I needed an app


732
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:11,856
to help me with a recipe, to not


733
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:13,306
make cooking any harder than it


734
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:13,966
already is.


735
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:15,806
And as soon as I was home, I


736
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,156
remembered that I needed to go


737
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,166
ahead and put, book pet care for


738
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,936
my two dogs because I'm going on


739
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:22,846
vacation after WWDC.


740
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:23,786
Aw, aren't they cute?


741
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:28,176
[laughs] Okay, we have to stop


742
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,066
before I get distracted.


743
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,136
We're talking about two tasks


744
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:34,176
here, cooking dinner and pet


745
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:34,476
care.


746
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:36,906
Why do the apps that help me


747
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,166
with those, why do they need to


748
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:38,826
be simple?


749
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,546
Well, it's because I don't go


750
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,746
into them all the time, so they


751
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:44,886
need to be instantly


752
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:46,546
understandable, as if I already


753
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:47,526
know how to use them.


754
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:49,556
So familiar navigation and


755
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,616
gestures really help with that.


756
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,196
You know, the goal is launch the


757
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:55,536
app, I totally get it, and I can


758
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,466
get the task done.


759
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:58,766
But why else should they be


760
00:24:58,766 --> 00:24:59,206
simple?


761
00:25:00,286 --> 00:25:02,696
Well, it could be a good day or


762
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:04,626
a bad day, but I'm using these


763
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:07,266
apps in real life, and that's


764
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:08,526
where all of my mental energy


765
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:10,666
should be, not wasted on a


766
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,066
confusing app UI, interaction,


767
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:14,086
or interface.


768
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:17,116
Apps should not be a burden, and


769
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,696
it's a lot easier to get back to


770
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:20,126
real life when they're simple.


771
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,986
So how would you describe


772
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:25,016
simplicity in apps and games?


773
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,986
>> It just has to work.


774
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:31,056
>> Right. It just has to work


775
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:32,346
for the people that are using


776
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:32,636
it.


777
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,056
But there's actually something


778
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:34,636
else here.


779
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:36,876
You don't want people to feel


780
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:37,806
distracted.


781
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:40,756
Simple, easy-to-understand apps


782
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,096
that just work, well, they help


783
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:44,276
keep people focused.


784
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:46,566
I know for me, I can get really


785
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:47,776
easily overwhelmed if


786
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,236
something's out of place.


787
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,446
It can just take me out of that


788
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:52,246
experience, and that makes


789
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:53,956
getting the task done even


790
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:54,426
harder.


791
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:56,466
I was actually talking to Jessie


792
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,706
about this, and I asked her,


793
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:00,806
what does she look for in great


794
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:01,326
apps?


795
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:04,246
>> Make my life feel a little


796
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,396
bit easier or make my life feel


797
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,026
a little bit nicer or more


798
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:08,816
luxurious.


799
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:11,566
>> I think that is just spot on.


800
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,946
Make my life feel a little bit


801
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:17,166
easier by being simple, focused,


802
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:20,086
instantly understandable, and


803
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:22,936
just do one thing really, really


804
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:23,076
well.


805
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:24,926
That is the goal.


806
00:26:25,396 --> 00:26:29,206
All right, this next aspiration


807
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:31,676
is to be stunning, and this came


808
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:32,716
up when I was talking to


809
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:33,406
Caroline.


810
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:36,626
I asked her, "What communicates


811
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:38,466
great visual design?"


812
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,786
>> Just that polish.


813
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:43,646
Does it look great?


814
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:44,866
Does it look stunning?


815
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:46,826
And then, the other level of


816
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:48,926
polish, on a different kind of


817
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,516
app, like a game or something,


818
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:52,716
to me is making it feel


819
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:54,806
beautiful as an experience, like


820
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:56,296
it feels like a work of art.


821
00:26:57,626 --> 00:26:58,666
>> Right, yes.


822
00:26:59,436 --> 00:27:00,476
So we talked a little bit


823
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:02,536
further about this, and Caroline


824
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:04,656
explained that what she means by


825
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:07,636
polish is things lining up just


826
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:08,986
the way you intend them to be,


827
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:10,956
including how it feels.


828
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:12,346
You know, swipe animations


829
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,006
lining right up with those swipe


830
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:14,596
gestures.


831
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,036
And the best apps appear


832
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,916
visually perfect, and that is


833
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:20,346
just totally remarkable.


834
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,506
And she also mentioned games.


835
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:25,676
Games should absolutely aspire


836
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:26,406
to be stunning.


837
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:29,706
Games are a perfect escape from


838
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:32,316
this world into a different one.


839
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,656
And they accomplish this through


840
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:36,586
stunning, immersive visuals.


841
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,466
I mean, I love TV and movies,


842
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,056
but that's a really passive


843
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:41,626
escape.


844
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:43,416
In games, well, they're an


845
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,986
active one, and that's why I


846
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:45,586
love them.


847
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,036
But there is one essential thing


848
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:49,896
that all games must do.


849
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:53,386
They must teach you, the player,


850
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:53,926
the rules.


851
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:56,086
And this is really a first


852
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:57,536
impression that people have of a


853
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,996
lot of games, so it makes me


854
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:02,426
really sad when games make a bad


855
00:28:02,486 --> 00:28:04,746
first impression because when


856
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:06,946
I'm trying to learn, well, the


857
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,576
rules feel slapped together,


858
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,076
added on last minute, or it just


859
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:12,316
doesn't feel a part of the


860
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,086
game's world.


861
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:16,706
So I decided to ask Sam, who's


862
00:28:16,706 --> 00:28:18,136
working on an upcoming game


863
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:20,416
called Where Cards Fall, "How do


864
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,036
you learn the rules of the game


865
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:24,116
all while staying in the game's


866
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:24,436
world?"


867
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:27,326
>> With games in particular,


868
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:29,066
there's a real joy that can come


869
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,196
from discovering what they can


870
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:33,126
do and learning for yourself.


871
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:34,916
People tend to remember things


872
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,206
the best when they experience


873
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:38,636
them themselves, when they learn


874
00:28:38,826 --> 00:28:40,496
them through some sort of active


875
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:41,526
discovery.


876
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:43,996
So if we give them too much at


877
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:45,556
the beginning, we're robbing


878
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,296
them of that chance to reward


879
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:48,386
their own curiosity.


880
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:49,926
So we always want to make sure


881
00:28:49,986 --> 00:28:51,446
that they stay curious, that


882
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:52,586
they stay interested throughout


883
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:54,976
the entire experience, and that


884
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:56,046
they have a lot of different


885
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:57,176
moments where they can be


886
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:58,566
rewarded for trying something.


887
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:00,086
And when they try something and


888
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:01,546
they discover something for the


889
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:03,126
first time, they definitely


890
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:03,806
won't forget it.


891
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:04,886
But if we throw up like a


892
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:06,746
tooltip or some way of just


893
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,676
making sure that we as the game


894
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:09,746
designers are comfortable


895
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:10,426
knowing that they know


896
00:29:10,426 --> 00:29:12,206
something, there's a pretty good


897
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,066
chance that they'll forget it


898
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,676
later on since they didn't go


899
00:29:14,676 --> 00:29:15,676
through the process of learning


900
00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:15,976
it themselves.


901
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:21,826
So when I go into a game for the


902
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:24,476
first time, I want to learn how


903
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:26,776
to navigate the world, if it


904
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:29,296
takes place in a world, as


905
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:30,496
quickly as possible or just how


906
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,656
to understand the rules of the


907
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:33,956
game as quickly as possible, but


908
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:35,986
not so quickly that I'm kind of


909
00:29:35,986 --> 00:29:37,266
robbed of my curiosity to


910
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,446
explore them a little bit


911
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:38,896
further.


912
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,546
So I tend to get a sense for


913
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:44,646
what the game is, and if the


914
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:46,466
game continues to surprise me,


915
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:48,716
I'll make it through to the


916
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:50,016
finish line.


917
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:53,376
>> Wow, that was learning the


918
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,436
rules in Where Cards Fall, and


919
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:57,156
that definitely feels a part of


920
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:59,626
the game's world, and I think


921
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,136
everyone can learn from what Sam


922
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,266
said about active discovery.


923
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:05,256
And this is not just for games.


924
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,696
Active discovery is so much


925
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:09,696
better than reading tooltips or


926
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:12,106
chasing a pointing arrow, and to


927
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:14,826
Sam's point, being told isn't as


928
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:17,206
much fun or, frankly, effective


929
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:19,016
as discovering something for


930
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:19,516
yourself.


931
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,346
It's kind of like being told


932
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:24,876
about a vacation versus being on


933
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:25,906
that vacation yourself.


934
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:28,246
It's way more fun, and you're


935
00:30:28,246 --> 00:30:29,666
just going to remember it better


936
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,416
if you actually go through that


937
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,116
experience.


938
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:35,106
So whether you're creating an


939
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:38,176
app or a game, aspire to be


940
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:38,776
stunning.


941
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:41,136
Create beautiful experiences,


942
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:43,696
polish your visual design so it


943
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:45,856
looks and feels just a part of


944
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:47,436
your app or game's world.


945
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:49,816
Okay, timeless.


946
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:54,156
This has been on my mind since


947
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:55,586
talking with Hugo, a sound


948
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:56,036
designer.


949
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:59,136
Most of you will recognize this.


950
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:10,196
[ Ringtone ]


951
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:11,876
I'm always looking for where


952
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:13,296
that phone is.


953
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,926
But what reminded me of this


954
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:17,726
ringtone was this part of the


955
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:18,376
interview.


956
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:23,406
>> If we create a ringtone for


957
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:27,126
the new iPhone, then we don't


958
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:28,916
want it to sound dated after a


959
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:29,776
year, of course.


960
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:31,766
It should still be a great


961
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,606
ringtone after 5 years, and


962
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:35,946
maybe people will still remember


963
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:36,936
it after 10 years.


964
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:41,286
>> It was actually this section


965
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:43,456
of the quote that really made me


966
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:45,116
think of timelessness.


967
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:47,486
You know, it makes sense for a


968
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:49,126
ringtone not to want to sound


969
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:51,706
dated, but this could also apply


970
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:53,246
to your visual and interaction


971
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,256
design too.


972
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,726
Hugo used this word "durability"


973
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:00,006
to describe quality during our


974
00:32:00,006 --> 00:32:01,686
interview, and I think that's


975
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:02,476
really great.


976
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,996
If we all aspire to create


977
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:06,246
designs that are just a little


978
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:08,556
bit longer lasting, it not only


979
00:32:08,556 --> 00:32:10,036
would save us time and effort


980
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:12,596
now, but it would put us into


981
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,536
the right mindset to provide


982
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:15,806
something that we create with


983
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:20,916
the opportunity to be timeless.


984
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:23,466
This final aspiration really had


985
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:25,536
an impact on me, and it came


986
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:27,166
from my colleague Doug when I


987
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,376
asked him, "What makes great app


988
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:29,976
experiences?"


989
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,126
>> When I think of, like, great


990
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,366
app experiences and things that


991
00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:38,466
kind of provide something unique


992
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:40,676
and valuable to users, I think a


993
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:43,556
lot of it is the substantial


994
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:45,496
kind of positive effect that it


995
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,546
has on the user's life.


996
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:51,066
>> Doug, you nailed it.


997
00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:53,486
Yes, absolutely, apps should


998
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:54,956
provide something unique and


999
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:57,366
valuable, but, actually, it was


1000
00:32:57,366 --> 00:32:58,946
this part, the positive effect,


1001
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:00,796
that really resonated with me.


1002
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:03,966
It made me reassess the apps and


1003
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:04,916
games on my phone.


1004
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:06,726
After this interview, I


1005
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,786
literally scrolled through all


1006
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,876
of my apps, and I thought, which


1007
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:13,136
ones have a positive effect on


1008
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:14,286
my life?


1009
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,036
You know, wouldn't it be great


1010
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,346
if life just had a little more


1011
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:20,226
positivity?


1012
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,396
So next time you design, strive


1013
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:26,676
for simplicity because real life


1014
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:28,086
if where we need to be spending


1015
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:28,736
our energy.


1016
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:32,826
Aspire to be stunning because we


1017
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:34,896
all need a break from chaos, and


1018
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:36,676
it's really nice to escape and


1019
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:38,056
experience something beautiful.


1020
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:41,016
Design to be timeless.


1021
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,126
Think about how your designs can


1022
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:45,586
be good now but also years from


1023
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:47,826
now because we could all design


1024
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:49,666
to be a little less trendy and


1025
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,006
definitely more durable.


1026
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:54,806
And finally, think about how you


1027
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:56,456
could have a positive impact on


1028
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:56,916
people's lives.


1029
00:33:58,196 --> 00:33:59,456
And, you know, this can manifest


1030
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,216
itself in really different ways


1031
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:02,896
depending on your app.


1032
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:04,166
It could be maybe that


1033
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,586
positivity is being really


1034
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,566
accurate, or maybe it's just


1035
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,706
being super entertaining.


1036
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:10,806
Maybe it's just making someone's


1037
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:13,216
life or day feel a little bit


1038
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:13,656
easier.


1039
00:34:13,656 --> 00:34:16,466
I hope that you found some of


1040
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:17,396
these thoughts to be as


1041
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,706
inspiring as I did.


1042
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:21,186
I'm sure you're thinking now,


1043
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,735
though, well, sure, this has


1044
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,545
been mildly inspiring and


1045
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:26,706
somewhat educational, but what


1046
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:27,585
can I do?


1047
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:29,196
What can I actually take away


1048
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:30,476
and apply to my work?


1049
00:34:30,476 --> 00:34:33,186
Well, I wanted to know that too.


1050
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,326
After talking with so many


1051
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:36,536
different people from different


1052
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:38,545
backgrounds, I wanted to know


1053
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,426
what they learned -- what they


1054
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,045
learned on the job through their


1055
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:43,036
experiences.


1056
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:44,476
So through a series of


1057
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:46,456
questions, I uncovered a few


1058
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,616
tips and techniques that these


1059
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:50,755
designers use regularly when


1060
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,306
designing.


1061
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:53,295
And something important to


1062
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:54,786
mention about design before we


1063
00:34:54,786 --> 00:34:58,726
get started is, yes, design is


1064
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:01,306
hard because nobody sets out to


1065
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:02,196
create a bad app.


1066
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:04,866
Making great designs is what we


1067
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:07,796
all strive for, but let's be


1068
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:08,206
honest.


1069
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:11,136
We don't always achieve it, and


1070
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:12,956
that's okay because we keep


1071
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:15,296
trying and we learn a lot along


1072
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:15,516
the way.


1073
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:19,756
Okay, let's go ahead and hear


1074
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:21,546
this first technique, and it


1075
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:22,576
really surprised me.


1076
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,196
It came up when I was talking


1077
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:25,166
with Loic [phonetic], a type


1078
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:27,586
designer, and I asked him, "What


1079
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,986
helps you with your work?"


1080
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:32,056
>> So in the case of type


1081
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:33,236
design, for instance, we've


1082
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:35,656
developed all kinds of little


1083
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:36,906
drawing tricks.


1084
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,296
In type design especially,


1085
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,036
subjectiveness I feel can


1086
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:42,496
[inaudible] even more than in


1087
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:44,106
other aspects of design because


1088
00:35:44,106 --> 00:35:46,706
we go to the depth of how the


1089
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:48,196
particular curve of, on the


1090
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:50,366
shoulder of a lowercase m is,


1091
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:50,916
for instance.


1092
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,566
And we can have a 10-minute


1093
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,906
discussion only on that.


1094
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:56,496
But the difficult part is


1095
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:59,596
describing what you see in words


1096
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:01,286
that the other person is going


1097
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,006
to understand the way you mean


1098
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:05,036
it, and that's very difficult


1099
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:06,106
when you're talking about shape.


1100
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:08,976
But one way we started doing


1101
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:10,266
that with some of my colleagues


1102
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:12,386
was basically redrawing the


1103
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:14,076
shape we're looking at with


1104
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:16,566
exaggerated features, where we


1105
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:18,406
basically kind of make a


1106
00:36:18,406 --> 00:36:19,676
caricature of what we are


1107
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:20,156
seeing.


1108
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,916
So if I'm pushing what I'm


1109
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:25,366
seeing to the extreme of why I


1110
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,966
find it ugly or uncomfortable,


1111
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:30,456
it's because it feels like that


1112
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:30,696
to me.


1113
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:32,616
And through that drawing,


1114
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:33,876
usually the other people can


1115
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:36,076
start seeing that much more


1116
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:38,506
toned down but existing feature


1117
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:40,116
of the design that they weren't


1118
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,616
necessarily perceiving before


1119
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,906
because that's not what they


1120
00:36:42,906 --> 00:36:44,386
were looking at.


1121
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:46,086
So it is about trying to make


1122
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:48,466
people see the world through


1123
00:36:48,526 --> 00:36:50,416
your eyes and the other way


1124
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:52,206
around, like gaining the ability


1125
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:53,206
to see the world through their


1126
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:55,686
eyes, so that you can then find


1127
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:56,926
that third place that is


1128
00:36:56,926 --> 00:37:00,906
actually the joint gaze that you


1129
00:37:00,906 --> 00:37:01,696
have on the world.


1130
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,916
And that's the, that I think to


1131
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:07,016
me is the key of a successful


1132
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,756
collaboration in design is


1133
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:13,656
finding that place.


1134
00:37:13,886 --> 00:37:15,946
>> Wow. Before we even dig into


1135
00:37:15,946 --> 00:37:17,826
this technique, have you thought


1136
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:19,076
about type design?


1137
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:20,896
I mean, every single letter that


1138
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:22,956
you text, and email, and that


1139
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:24,696
you read, that's been designed,


1140
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,666
and type designers care so much


1141
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,336
about detail that they've


1142
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:31,176
invented ways to communicate


1143
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:33,256
about shape when there are no


1144
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:33,696
words.


1145
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,736
That's just so cool.


1146
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,446
So to Loic's point, when you're


1147
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:40,226
designing for others, it's


1148
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:42,016
really necessary to see the


1149
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,046
world through their eyes, and


1150
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:45,546
this technique helps achieve


1151
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:46,686
that.


1152
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:50,256
So draw caricatures and ask


1153
00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:51,456
others to do the same.


1154
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:53,416
It's really the importance of


1155
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,636
putting yourself in others'


1156
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:56,276
shoes because you can better


1157
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,496
understand their world.


1158
00:37:58,126 --> 00:37:59,686
And this is a great tool for


1159
00:37:59,686 --> 00:38:01,786
communication if words are not


1160
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:03,306
doing it, and it'll help you


1161
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:04,546
understand what others are


1162
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:04,986
seeing.


1163
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:08,416
This next technique is going to


1164
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,236
be unveiled through a story.


1165
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,236
Actually, even better, a first


1166
00:38:13,446 --> 00:38:14,426
job story.


1167
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:17,226
Because you learn a lot on your


1168
00:38:17,226 --> 00:38:19,286
first job, and they have a huge


1169
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:19,616
impact.


1170
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,356
So I asked my colleague Doug


1171
00:38:22,496 --> 00:38:24,106
what he learned at his first


1172
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:24,946
design job.


1173
00:38:25,526 --> 00:38:30,296
>> One of the real kind of ahas


1174
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:33,406
for me was a question that I got


1175
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:35,196
at the Tech Museum from the Head


1176
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,546
of Design that was essentially,


1177
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:39,056
why is this good?


1178
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:41,166
Why is this thing that you just


1179
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,376
gave me good?


1180
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:45,486
And, you know, my initial


1181
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:47,276
reaction was, well, because I


1182
00:38:47,346 --> 00:38:49,366
think this will be easy for


1183
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:50,316
people to do.


1184
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:53,326
And, you know, he responded,


1185
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:54,406
like, well, how do you know


1186
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:54,576
that?


1187
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:55,966
How do you know that this is


1188
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,666
going to be easier than the way


1189
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,486
that we do it now?


1190
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:01,946
And I kind of realized that I


1191
00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:03,446
didn't know the answer to that.


1192
00:39:03,446 --> 00:39:05,056
And then, I realized what he was


1193
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:07,716
really asking is, should we put


1194
00:39:07,716 --> 00:39:10,046
all of this energy into making


1195
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:11,816
the changes that you're


1196
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:12,756
suggesting?


1197
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:14,546
How can we be sure that that's


1198
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:15,696
the right thing to do?


1199
00:39:15,926 --> 00:39:18,756
And to answer that question, I


1200
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:21,306
opened up -- it might have been


1201
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:23,656
Microsoft Paint [laughs] -- and


1202
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:27,136
I drew a picture, and I took it


1203
00:39:27,136 --> 00:39:29,706
out onto the museum floor, and


1204
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:32,756
basically asked visitors to give


1205
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:35,176
me their impression of what they


1206
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:37,446
thought they should do based on


1207
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:39,176
kind of how I had arranged


1208
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,136
things on the screen.


1209
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:42,816
>> So what Doug was talking


1210
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:44,146
about here, and he went on to


1211
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:46,596
explain, that it was this method


1212
00:39:46,596 --> 00:39:48,736
of prototyping that helped him


1213
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,026
answer that question from his


1214
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:50,376
boss.


1215
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,156
Why should we put energy into


1216
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:53,786
your idea?


1217
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,156
So what Doug learned at his


1218
00:39:56,276 --> 00:39:58,196
first design job was that he


1219
00:39:58,226 --> 00:40:00,096
could not assume that his


1220
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:01,236
designs were going to work.


1221
00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:03,476
And this actually also came up


1222
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:05,106
in my conversation with Gary.


1223
00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:07,666
>> It wasn't just designed on


1224
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,306
paper, implemented in code, and


1225
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:13,046
sort of assumed that that was


1226
00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:13,336
going to work.


1227
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,906
You can't just assume from your


1228
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:18,266
own experience and through


1229
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:19,756
chatting that something's going


1230
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:20,006
to work.


1231
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:20,766
You've really got to go out and


1232
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:20,956
try it.


1233
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,236
>> And I think this is the part


1234
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:25,886
that's really important not to


1235
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:26,326
overlook.


1236
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:28,616
You know, in this case, we are


1237
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:30,296
talking about trying designs in


1238
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:32,906
context out in the real world to


1239
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:35,186
vet solutions to problems, and


1240
00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:36,706
trying solutions is something


1241
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:37,956
that Sam mentioned too.


1242
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:42,196
>> One of our ethos's is to


1243
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:43,086
solve a problem.


1244
00:40:43,286 --> 00:40:45,196
Put it in front of players and


1245
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:46,416
see how they react.


1246
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,316
See if they're learning what


1247
00:40:47,316 --> 00:40:47,976
they need to learn.


1248
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:49,706
And if we need to do more, we'll


1249
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:50,146
do more.


1250
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,386
It's impossible to rush the


1251
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:55,216
creative process of making a


1252
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:57,496
game because so much of what's


1253
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,846
special about the games that you


1254
00:40:58,846 --> 00:41:01,726
remember are decisions that seem


1255
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:03,456
very obvious and very small but


1256
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:05,616
take a really, really long time


1257
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:06,786
to arrive at.


1258
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:08,486
And you can't hire more people


1259
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:09,406
to get there faster.


1260
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:12,006
You just have to sit with it and


1261
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,866
continue working on it until the


1262
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:14,976
best solutions arise.


1263
00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:18,886
>> So Sam said something here


1264
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:20,176
that I want to expand on.


1265
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:22,856
More people are not going to fix


1266
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:24,176
a creative problem.


1267
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,906
Great artists are patient.


1268
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:29,326
Sometimes you just get writer's


1269
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:30,856
block and there's no amount of


1270
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:32,296
conversation that's going to fix


1271
00:41:32,296 --> 00:41:34,856
it, so you have to wait and just


1272
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:36,326
let that creative process


1273
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:36,846
happen.


1274
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:38,506
And that's okay.


1275
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:41,206
It's a part of the process, and


1276
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:42,866
sometimes that's exactly what is


1277
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:44,586
needed to produce quality.


1278
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:47,336
So the theme really from these


1279
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,976
last 3 clips is to go out and


1280
00:41:50,136 --> 00:41:52,626
try your designs in context with


1281
00:41:52,626 --> 00:41:53,376
real people.


1282
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:55,926
Show people prototypes and learn


1283
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:56,556
from their feedback.


1284
00:41:57,376 --> 00:41:58,696
This is a really essential


1285
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,646
technique to help work through


1286
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:01,866
your design decisions.


1287
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:05,306
So we can learn a lot from each


1288
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:07,356
other, so I wanted to know what


1289
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,506
advice would one designer give


1290
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:10,686
to another designer.


1291
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:14,656
>> Learn how to accept, and


1292
00:42:14,776 --> 00:42:16,296
sort, and prioritize the


1293
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:17,846
feedback as it comes in, whether


1294
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:19,036
it's from yourself or from


1295
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:19,336
others.


1296
00:42:19,906 --> 00:42:21,116
You will learn so much more


1297
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,226
quickly than if you are


1298
00:42:22,226 --> 00:42:23,966
defensive and you just, like,


1299
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:24,616
buckle down.


1300
00:42:26,496 --> 00:42:27,666
>> I personally struggle with


1301
00:42:27,706 --> 00:42:28,526
this.


1302
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:30,266
I can almost not help becoming


1303
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:32,326
defensive when I hear feedback


1304
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:33,406
on a project I'm working on.


1305
00:42:33,406 --> 00:42:35,286
It's like this instinctual


1306
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,326
reaction, especially if I just


1307
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:38,956
spent late nights and weekends


1308
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,026
working on something.


1309
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:43,406
But still, I know it's


1310
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:46,216
important, but I wanted to know


1311
00:42:46,216 --> 00:42:46,556
why.


1312
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:49,596
Again, why is it important to be


1313
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:50,676
open to feedback?


1314
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:53,966
>> I think there's also just a


1315
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:55,206
reality, which is after you've


1316
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,126
used your own work for some


1317
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,716
amount of time, you naturally


1318
00:42:58,716 --> 00:43:00,396
develop some blind spots.


1319
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:01,966
And that's where having a really


1320
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:03,166
great, collaborative team and


1321
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,916
people that you trust around you


1322
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,986
to help critique your work is a


1323
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:07,896
really important part of the


1324
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:09,126
design process.


1325
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,406
So you can get fresh eyes on


1326
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:11,926
stuff and trust that people have


1327
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,436
the good intentions and they're


1328
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:14,986
going to be able to give you


1329
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:16,006
great insights of how you can


1330
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:16,406
improve.


1331
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:18,276
>> Totally.


1332
00:43:18,956 --> 00:43:19,646
I've been there.


1333
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:21,026
I've definitely been too close


1334
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:22,396
on a project and lost sight of a


1335
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:24,266
big picture or overlooked some


1336
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:24,756
detail.


1337
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,196
So by being open to feedback,


1338
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:30,286
it's really easy then to have


1339
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:32,596
someone else like your team or


1340
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:33,306
somebody that you asked a


1341
00:43:33,306 --> 00:43:35,346
question to give you something,


1342
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,506
some piece of information that


1343
00:43:36,506 --> 00:43:37,566
can help you improve your


1344
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:38,076
designs.


1345
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,546
And I really like that May-Li


1346
00:43:40,646 --> 00:43:42,336
said this word, "trust," to


1347
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:43,746
trust the people around you.


1348
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:46,646
So be open to feedback.


1349
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:48,986
It makes everything better and


1350
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:50,816
just ups the overall quality of


1351
00:43:50,846 --> 00:43:52,726
design in your work.


1352
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:55,876
So this next technique is more


1353
00:43:55,876 --> 00:43:57,706
of a mindset, and it came up


1354
00:43:57,756 --> 00:43:59,396
when I asked Cas, who works on


1355
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:01,626
platform patterns, "How do you


1356
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:03,506
approach designing for so many


1357
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:03,866
people?"


1358
00:44:03,866 --> 00:44:06,876
>> Knowing what you don't know,


1359
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:08,696
in a way.


1360
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:12,286
What I mean is that if you're


1361
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:13,266
looking at these things or if


1362
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:14,346
you're designing for these


1363
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:15,396
things, obviously, you have


1364
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:19,046
ideas and ways of using a


1365
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:20,516
certain device or an app in your


1366
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:21,396
own way, in your own


1367
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:22,826
environment, in your own habits,


1368
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:24,856
and you might know a little bit


1369
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:26,266
about how your friends are using


1370
00:44:26,336 --> 00:44:27,956
it, or how you've seen other


1371
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,296
people use it, or maybe feedback


1372
00:44:29,296 --> 00:44:30,996
you're getting, but it's a


1373
00:44:30,996 --> 00:44:32,426
really big world, and there's a


1374
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:34,516
lot of people out there, and


1375
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:35,876
they all have their own needs,


1376
00:44:35,936 --> 00:44:38,076
their own habits, their own way


1377
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:39,356
of going through life.


1378
00:44:39,356 --> 00:44:40,546
And so you have to be very


1379
00:44:40,546 --> 00:44:42,766
mindful that how you think about


1380
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:43,926
things or your opinions are not


1381
00:44:43,926 --> 00:44:45,506
always, first of all, correct


1382
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:48,896
ones, nor the only ones.


1383
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:50,916
>> I really like how Cas put


1384
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:53,146
this at the beginning -- know


1385
00:44:53,196 --> 00:44:54,146
that you don't know.


1386
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:56,286
And he also used this word


1387
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:57,326
"modesty" through our


1388
00:44:57,326 --> 00:44:58,176
conversation.


1389
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:00,156
To be unassuming when you're


1390
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,046
designing for so many people.


1391
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:05,376
And that is a really great


1392
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:06,646
headspace to be in when you're


1393
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:08,846
approaching design; to be modest


1394
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,686
and to be mindful.


1395
00:45:11,316 --> 00:45:14,656
So how do you help keep people's


1396
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:16,606
experiences top of mind when


1397
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:17,246
you're designing?


1398
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:19,826
>> So in many ways, I just have


1399
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:21,966
to be skeptical and ask


1400
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:23,516
questions if the idea in front


1401
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:25,566
of me, is that going to work for


1402
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:27,266
someone in a wheelchair, for


1403
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:27,726
example?


1404
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:28,866
Is that going to work for


1405
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:33,086
someone that has never used this


1406
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:33,686
app before?


1407
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:36,476
Is it going to work for someone


1408
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:37,996
coming from a PC to a Mac?


1409
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:39,716
You just have to ask lots of


1410
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:41,756
questions, and it can just start


1411
00:45:41,756 --> 00:45:43,206
people thinking about, oh, yeah,


1412
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:44,456
did I care enough to consider


1413
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:47,346
that aspect of it?


1414
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:49,816
>> Right. So this may seem


1415
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:51,996
really simple, but it's


1416
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:53,756
important to ask questions,


1417
00:45:54,106 --> 00:45:55,236
especially from different


1418
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:55,956
perspectives.


1419
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:57,296
That's going to help you


1420
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,836
maintain quality throughout your


1421
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,366
work and keep those other


1422
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,706
people's experiences in mind.


1423
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,296
So design is a really


1424
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:06,936
collaborative process, and


1425
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:08,336
there's a lot that goes into


1426
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:09,706
making collaboration work.


1427
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:12,146
At one point or another, we're


1428
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:13,386
all going to start on a new


1429
00:46:13,386 --> 00:46:15,636
project or a new team, so what


1430
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:17,806
helps make that process a little


1431
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:18,456
bit easier?


1432
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:21,006
>> I always like to set


1433
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:22,236
expectations upfront.


1434
00:46:22,886 --> 00:46:24,666
I just say, hey, this is how I


1435
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:25,016
am.


1436
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:27,956
This is how I work.


1437
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:29,386
This is how I communicate.


1438
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,196
How do you work?


1439
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:31,356
How do you communicate?


1440
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,806
What's your preferred method of


1441
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:33,586
communication?


1442
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:36,076
And by the way, here's the goals


1443
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:38,126
that I think we are working


1444
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:38,516
toward.


1445
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:39,856
And here are the things that are


1446
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:40,566
important to me.


1447
00:46:40,566 --> 00:46:42,246
And please share with me the


1448
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:43,186
same for you.


1449
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:45,396
And I'll always sort of say it


1450
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:46,666
with a caveat like, "We're going


1451
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:47,946
to get all this business out of


1452
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:48,836
the way, and we're going to


1453
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:52,826
speak very directly about it."


1454
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:55,666
>> I know for me, talking about


1455
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:56,896
communication can be awkward,


1456
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,056
but after I tried this


1457
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,686
technique, I learned that it


1458
00:47:00,686 --> 00:47:03,316
helps avoid so much drama and


1459
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:04,016
confusion.


1460
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,866
So talk about communication,


1461
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:08,506
especially if you're working on


1462
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:08,986
teams.


1463
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,346
Work towards the same goal about


1464
00:47:11,346 --> 00:47:12,556
creating something great.


1465
00:47:14,026 --> 00:47:16,396
So really, these six techniques


1466
00:47:16,796 --> 00:47:18,596
are all about caring about the


1467
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:20,596
other people and having tools to


1468
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:22,566
talk about it, and you have to


1469
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:24,056
care about other people and put


1470
00:47:24,056 --> 00:47:24,956
yourself second.


1471
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:27,506
Be mindful of their lives and be


1472
00:47:27,506 --> 00:47:29,816
modest about your own because we


1473
00:47:29,816 --> 00:47:31,606
just learned you can't assume.


1474
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:33,216
You have to go out and try your


1475
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:35,166
designs through prototyping and


1476
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,826
also really remain open to


1477
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:37,476
feedback.


1478
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:39,256
That's essential to making


1479
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,586
progress in design because, as


1480
00:47:42,586 --> 00:47:44,876
May-Li said, we all develop


1481
00:47:44,956 --> 00:47:47,866
blind spots, and we're not only


1482
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:50,026
designing to make progress, but


1483
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:51,356
we want to get closer to


1484
00:47:51,356 --> 00:47:52,886
reaching our own aspirations and


1485
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:53,446
our own goals.


1486
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:56,866
So these techniques are used by


1487
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:58,656
real designers that I talked to,


1488
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,876
and they help them go through


1489
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:02,176
the process of designing, and it


1490
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:03,566
makes their days a little bit


1491
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:05,836
easier, so I hope they can help


1492
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:06,936
you too.


1493
00:48:07,856 --> 00:48:09,806
So after all of these


1494
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,956
interviews, I learned that


1495
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:14,636
quality is the result of time,


1496
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:16,326
effort, and care.


1497
00:48:17,116 --> 00:48:19,316
It's considered, it's crafted,


1498
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:21,096
and it means something different


1499
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:21,906
to different people.


1500
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:24,976
I also learned that quality


1501
00:48:24,976 --> 00:48:27,366
impacts our every day, that your


1502
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,076
intentions are truly felt.


1503
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:32,316
High quality evokes trust, and


1504
00:48:32,316 --> 00:48:34,246
that's really important, as well


1505
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:36,786
as it has to be earned.


1506
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,416
It's also important to strive


1507
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,166
for simplicity, to aspire to be


1508
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,126
stunning, and design to be


1509
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:43,536
timeless.


1510
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:45,966
Just think about how your app or


1511
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,726
game can have a positive impact


1512
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,386
on people's lives.


1513
00:48:49,936 --> 00:48:51,856
And finally, working towards


1514
00:48:51,856 --> 00:48:53,116
quality is all about


1515
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:54,986
communication, collaboration,


1516
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:57,496
and understanding, especially


1517
00:48:57,496 --> 00:48:58,866
understanding the people you are


1518
00:48:58,866 --> 00:48:59,626
designing for.


1519
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:02,586
So really, quality is a


1520
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:03,166
principle.


1521
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:06,156
It is intentional, and it's


1522
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:07,326
something that you have to ask


1523
00:49:07,326 --> 00:49:09,326
yourself, what does quality mean


1524
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:09,916
to you?


1525
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:11,506
And you need to know your


1526
00:49:11,506 --> 00:49:14,196
interpretation to go forward, to


1527
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:16,486
put in that hard work that meets


1528
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,076
your expectations and hits your


1529
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:21,006
aspirations because, at the end


1530
00:49:21,006 --> 00:49:23,046
of the day, you're not designing


1531
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:23,656
for you.


1532
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:25,676
You're designing for other


1533
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:27,226
people who are going to use your


1534
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:28,466
app or your game.


1535
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,846
So make great designs for them.


1536
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:34,176
Now, there are two important


1537
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:35,726
statements on quality in great


1538
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,856
design that stand alone.


1539
00:49:38,616 --> 00:49:39,646
These are going to play back to


1540
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:41,536
back, and I hope each offers


1541
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:42,596
something different that you can


1542
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:44,396
take away from today.


1543
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:49,216
>> Sensing the human behind the


1544
00:49:49,216 --> 00:49:51,626
experience I think is really an


1545
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:53,696
earmark of something great.


1546
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,096
>> A great design is going to be


1547
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:02,586
the product of tremendous amount


1548
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:04,666
of effort, and creativity, and


1549
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:07,316
skill, and [laughs] late nights.


1550
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:10,086
It's going to seem effortless,


1551
00:50:10,186 --> 00:50:12,606
and it should hopefully recede


1552
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:14,146
in people's consciousness.


1553
00:50:14,736 --> 00:50:16,906
And in a way, I think you're


1554
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:18,656
very aware of an interface which


1555
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:20,456
has been poorly designed, and


1556
00:50:20,456 --> 00:50:21,706
you're not at all aware of an


1557
00:50:21,706 --> 00:50:23,356
interface which has been well


1558
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:23,826
designed.


1559
00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:29,546
>> So I talked to a lot of


1560
00:50:29,546 --> 00:50:31,586
people, and I saved something


1561
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:33,446
special just for the end.


1562
00:50:34,266 --> 00:50:35,856
Since I had the opportunity to


1563
00:50:35,936 --> 00:50:37,026
talk to so many different


1564
00:50:37,026 --> 00:50:39,566
designers, I had to ask them onw


1565
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:40,906
final question, and it's


1566
00:50:40,906 --> 00:50:42,226
something that I've always


1567
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:45,036
wanted, wondered myself: What


1568
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,536
are designers' favorite colors?


1569
00:50:50,896 --> 00:50:51,906
>> Oh, wow.


1570
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,916
>> My favorite color?


1571
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,716
>> I have to say--


1572
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,066
>> Is there such a thing?


1573
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:58,816
I don't think so.


1574
00:50:58,896 --> 00:51:00,076
>> I would have said glitter,


1575
00:51:00,076 --> 00:51:01,076
but it's not a color.


1576
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:02,436
>> One of the things that I


1577
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:04,496
really love is Tahitian blue.


1578
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:06,736
>> But colors to me are like


1579
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:09,006
moods, and I do not have the


1580
00:51:09,006 --> 00:51:09,936
same mood every day.


1581
00:51:09,936 --> 00:51:10,796
I don't think I even have the


1582
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:12,516
same mood every hour, so.


1583
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:13,436
>> I really like white.


1584
00:51:14,236 --> 00:51:15,186
Is it really a color?


1585
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:16,366
I think that's one of the


1586
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:17,486
reasons why I like it.


1587
00:51:17,486 --> 00:51:18,646
>> My favorite color has been


1588
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:19,046
amber.


1589
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:20,896
>> I mean, lately, it's been


1590
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:22,216
green for some reason.


1591
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:22,926
I don't know why.


1592
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:25,746
>> I got to go back on this


1593
00:51:25,746 --> 00:51:26,046
answer.


1594
00:51:26,046 --> 00:51:29,346
Oh, it's actually Pantone 347.


1595
00:51:29,346 --> 00:51:30,856
>> My favorite color is blue.


1596
00:51:31,376 --> 00:51:33,996
>> Like a happy blue, and blue


1597
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:35,566
is, like, always such a color of


1598
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:37,076
responsibility, which is, like,


1599
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:37,976
so me.


1600
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:39,806
>> But I just think it's, like,


1601
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,596
soft and friendly.


1602
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:44,886
And food that's pink tastes


1603
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:44,976
good.


1604
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:46,416
>> I'm going to go with red.


1605
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,506
>> Throw out a hex value.


1606
00:51:47,506 --> 00:51:48,996
I don't have a favorite color.


1607
00:51:49,446 --> 00:51:50,466
Every color's great.


1608
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:53,316
>> [laughs] All right, maybe


1609
00:51:53,316 --> 00:51:54,886
I'll just answer for this moment


1610
00:51:55,096 --> 00:51:56,326
in time.


1611
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:58,426
>> I don't wear any green.


1612
00:51:58,596 --> 00:52:00,376
My car's not green.


1613
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:04,866
But I just like the idea of


1614
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:05,346
green.


1615
00:52:05,696 --> 00:52:07,746
>> And I can't pick one because


1616
00:52:08,026 --> 00:52:09,326
I wouldn't be able to pick a


1617
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:12,966
single musical note, so I'll use


1618
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:14,476
all of them where it makes


1619
00:52:14,476 --> 00:52:14,876
sense.


1620
00:52:15,786 --> 00:52:17,846
>> I'll need to check the spec


1621
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:19,046
on that, I think.


1622
00:52:19,456 --> 00:52:20,806
System blue, of course.


1623
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:20,936
Yeah.


1624
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:27,466
>> Special thanks to everyone


1625
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:28,486
who participated in these


1626
00:52:28,486 --> 00:52:29,026
interviews.


1627
00:52:29,476 --> 00:52:30,766
Thank you all so much.


1628
00:52:30,826 --> 00:52:32,276
Have a great WWDC.
