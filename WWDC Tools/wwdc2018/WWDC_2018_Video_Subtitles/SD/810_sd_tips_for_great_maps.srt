[ Music ]


2
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:22,076
>> Maps are everywhere.


3
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:24,016
People have been recording


4
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:25,286
information about the world


5
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,436
around them as far as we can


6
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:27,766
tell.


7
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,916
And we use maps for a wide


8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:30,976
variety of purposes.


9
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:34,836
Like finding a new hiking trail


10
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:38,076
or keeping tabs on the progress


11
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:40,086
of our dinner or dessert order.


12
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:43,706
We can even use maps to orient


13
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:45,726
ourselves in imaginary places,


14
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:47,416
tracking our movement through


15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,626
levels of a game, or a


16
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,596
character's position on a


17
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,866
fictional battlefield.


18
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:55,756
Mapping technologies continue to


19
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,356
evolve, but the essential


20
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:59,246
characteristics of maps remain


21
00:00:59,246 --> 00:00:59,796
the same.


22
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:01,976
They are abstract


23
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:04,016
representations of real or


24
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:06,276
fictional places, that show


25
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:07,556
features relative to other


26
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:09,086
features in space, and they


27
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,916
offer information about the


28
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:12,576
attributes of those features.


29
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,466
Maps are tremendously useful and


30
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,696
they're really fun to make.


31
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:19,596
One option to consider is


32
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,336
MapKit, our native framework.


33
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,096
You can see it here in the


34
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:23,606
activity app.


35
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,306
MapKit does a lot of work for


36
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:26,496
you.


37
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:28,506
It integrates cleanly with the


38
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:29,256
rest of our UI.


39
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:32,366
It contains base map data and


40
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,446
satellite imagery for the entire


41
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:34,936
world.


42
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,506
It allows users to pan and zoom,


43
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:39,736
and it looks great.


44
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,856
But depending on your data and


45
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:43,516
design requirements, you


46
00:01:43,516 --> 00:01:44,956
sometimes need something a bit


47
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:45,786
more custom.


48
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:47,976
So, we'll talk about the process


49
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:50,366
of map creation and review three


50
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,716
key tips for making a map shine,


51
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,176
which will be relevant


52
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:55,676
regardless of how you're


53
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:56,456
creating your maps.


54
00:01:57,176 --> 00:01:58,236
There's a lot to know about


55
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:00,156
making exceptional maps, but


56
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:02,376
here's an excellent place to


57
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:04,556
start.


58
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:07,896
First, know your audience and


59
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:08,626
what they need.


60
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,736
Second, carefully choose your


61
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:13,676
map elements and leave out the


62
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,626
things that aren't necessary.


63
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,916
And third, focus on hierarchy so


64
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,796
that it's immediately clear what


65
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:21,916
is most important.


66
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,016
Why know your audience?


67
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,946
Well, you need to know what your


68
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,446
users are trying to do.


69
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,226
Because this knowledge will


70
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:31,806
shape every part of your map,


71
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:34,316
from the features you include to


72
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,326
your design decisions.


73
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:37,566
And the success of your map


74
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:38,886
really depends on its


75
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:40,576
responsiveness to those user


76
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,036
goals.


77
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,456
Keep in mind that you sometimes


78
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:44,786
have more than one group of


79
00:02:44,786 --> 00:02:46,636
users with different needs.


80
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:49,186
For instance, if you're making a


81
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,766
navigation map, perhaps you'll


82
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,526
have some users traveling by


83
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:57,816
bike, others on transit, and the


84
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:58,636
rest by boat.


85
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:00,516
So, these different modes of


86
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,316
transportation will mean that


87
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,996
your users are concerned about


88
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:04,846
different things.


89
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,306
Grade matters a lot to cyclists,


90
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,626
so they might need contour lines


91
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:10,916
or other indications about


92
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,656
topography.


93
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,146
Train passengers are especially


94
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:15,786
likely to want transit stations


95
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,386
represented very clearly.


96
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:20,196
And those arriving by boat care


97
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:21,976
much more about dock amenities


98
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,346
and bathymetry than others.


99
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,576
Keeping these types of needs in


100
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:27,186
mind helps you make a more


101
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:27,776
useful map.


102
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,896
Let's look at an example.


103
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:33,856
We're going to build a map for a


104
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:35,346
fictional game about my cat.


105
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,496
It's is called Pantera's Big


106
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,986
Adventure and in it, players


107
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,746
travel Pac-Man style around the


108
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,316
neighborhood picking up as many


109
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:45,086
catnip mice as they can before


110
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:46,306
it's time to go home for dinner.


111
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,876
We'll build out the game map and


112
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:50,866
use this exercise to illustrate


113
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,186
those three tips.


114
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:54,746
This map is a bit unusual for a


115
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:55,676
few reasons.


116
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,506
It will also function as a


117
00:03:57,506 --> 00:03:59,356
gameboard, it's showing an


118
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,726
imaginary place, and perhaps


119
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,566
most importantly, it's only


120
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,836
going to exist at one scale.


121
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,966
If we were making a map where


122
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,566
users could zoom in and out,


123
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,136
we'd need to think carefully


124
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,656
about how our data and display


125
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,466
might change at different zooms.


126
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,826
But this is a design studio


127
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,666
short, not a design studio long.


128
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,866
So, we're going to stick with


129
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:19,826
just one zoom.


130
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:22,326
However, the principles are


131
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,056
going to be the same whether


132
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,566
your mapping a cat's escapades


133
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,786
through a fictional neighborhood


134
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:29,026
or making a dynamic map of the


135
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,106
whole entire world.


136
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:32,796
So, let's get started by


137
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,216
thinking about the purpose of


138
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:34,706
this map.


139
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:36,846
We want to make a game that


140
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:38,146
would be perfect to play for a


141
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,986
few minutes on the bus, or while


142
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:41,106
relaxing in a park.


143
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,736
And we're going to want to make


144
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:43,786
sure that our map really


145
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:44,566
reflects this.


146
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,546
It should be fun, kind of


147
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:49,696
cartoony, cute and lighthearted,


148
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:51,776
and really simple to understand.


149
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:53,706
So, let's think about what


150
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:55,026
players will be doing within


151
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:55,656
this game.


152
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,046
It's pretty intuitive, they're


153
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:59,126
going to be moving around the


154
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,306
map finding the mice and


155
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,426
avoiding the hazards.


156
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,036
So, they'll need to see


157
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:06,566
sidewalks, mice, and hazards.


158
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:08,966
Okay, enough talking about maps.


159
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:11,266
Let's get started building it.


160
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,076
We're not going to take the time


161
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:14,936
to style it right away and we're


162
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,356
going to be iterating on this


163
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:17,386
design throughout.


164
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:18,936
This is going to be a work in


165
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:20,946
progress but we're going to keep


166
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,566
the map purpose and the user


167
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,146
goals in mind throughout.


168
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:27,036
So, we'll start with sidewalks


169
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:28,786
because the street is too hot


170
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,946
for delicate kitty toes and


171
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,796
sometimes the grass is damp.


172
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:34,366
And then, we'll add the mice,


173
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,036
and now those hazards.


174
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:41,366
Dogs, Pantera is not a fan, as


175
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,166
well as fountains, which


176
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:45,326
sometimes unpredictably spray


177
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:45,806
water.


178
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,556
So, these are the essential


179
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:51,236
elements from that list.


180
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:52,906
But we should also include


181
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,726
Pantera's house, where she


182
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,766
begins each round.


183
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,186
Of course, Pantera herself.


184
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,856
And the pet store where she can


185
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:04,666
regain her health.


186
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,396
Okay so, this is starting to


187
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:07,206
come together.


188
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:08,966
Remember we're going to restyle


189
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,586
later on, but this map looks


190
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:13,136
kind of bare in places, and


191
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:14,716
doesn't give us all the


192
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,066
information that we might really


193
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:16,296
want.


194
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,976
So, we can all think of elements


195
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,386
that we've seen in other maps.


196
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:22,786
Let's add some of them and then


197
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:24,006
decide whether or not they


198
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:25,896
really belong in this particular


199
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:26,086
map.


200
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,056
We could, for example, include


201
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,246
the rest of the building


202
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:31,026
footprints.


203
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:33,836
Maybe some polygons for those


204
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:34,566
parks.


205
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:36,836
Perhaps a title.


206
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:40,066
Possibly even a legend.


207
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,286
Lots of maps have a compass rose


208
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:43,846
and a scale bar.


209
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:45,766
Oh, right, and since this map is


210
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,076
doubling as a gameboard, we'll


211
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:49,086
need a few other elements too.


212
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:51,646
Like a health indicator, a mouse


213
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:52,036
counter.


214
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:53,626
How can we know if we're


215
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:54,826
successful otherwise.


216
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:55,916
And a timer.


217
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,176
This game doesn't last forever.


218
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:01,406
All right.


219
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:05,126
But wait. It's easy for maps to


220
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:05,936
get overloaded.


221
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,016
And this is a great example of


222
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:09,036
that exact problem.


223
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,086
Way too much is happening here.


224
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:15,746
Our map is chaotic and it's not


225
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:17,466
necessarily reflective of our


226
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,606
intent, which was to create


227
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,756
something that's cute, fun to


228
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,506
look at, and easy to understand.


229
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,646
And, thinking back to the


230
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:26,556
purpose of this map, we're


231
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:27,966
losing sight of the features


232
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:29,276
that are most important to


233
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:31,286
users, mice, sidewalks, and


234
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:31,856
hazards.


235
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:33,656
So, let's fix this.


236
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:38,146
It's time to think seriously


237
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:39,366
about leaving things out.


238
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:41,556
Because when it comes to maps,


239
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,266
knowing what to omit is just as


240
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,616
important as knowing what to


241
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:46,096
include.


242
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,006
We're going to remove some of


243
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:49,556
the elements that aren't really


244
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,376
necessary for this particular


245
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:52,226
map.


246
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:56,366
So, as we know the map exists


247
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,266
within our game.


248
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:59,476
So, don't really need a title


249
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,156
here though of course we'd want


250
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:04,126
a title on many other maps.


251
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:05,986
Legends are really important for


252
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,356
maps with more complicated


253
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,236
symbology.


254
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:09,826
But I don't think we need one


255
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:10,136
here.


256
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,786
It's pretty straightforward.


257
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:16,316
The compass rose is demanding a


258
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:17,466
lot of attention.


259
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:21,236
But this isn't a navigation map


260
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:22,496
and cardinal directions are


261
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:23,906
irrelevant in this game.


262
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,466
And let's lose the scale bar


263
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:26,846
too.


264
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,916
We'd want it if we were using


265
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:33,246
the map to plan a trip but were


266
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:33,336
not.


267
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:35,356
Okay. So, take a look over there


268
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:35,775
on the right.


269
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:38,176
We've removed a lot of noise


270
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:38,616
from the map.


271
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:40,256
And we've ended up with a leaner


272
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:41,515
set of elements.


273
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,076
Notice too that we aren't


274
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:44,566
including things like road or


275
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:45,436
park labels.


276
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:47,106
They aren't needed for this map,


277
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,576
and they would add a lot of


278
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:49,066
clutter.


279
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,846
You can probably think of other


280
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,406
map elements that we're leaving


281
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:52,946
out too.


282
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,886
So, this is moving us in the


283
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:55,766
right direction.


284
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,516
But our map definitely still


285
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:58,136
need some work.


286
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:00,456
Let's think about how to modify


287
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:05,596
our display and make sure that


288
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:06,916
we're highlighting what really


289
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,746
matters and minimizing what


290
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:09,086
doesn't.


291
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,066
So, to do this, we're going to


292
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,666
look back on our list of key


293
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,416
elements.


294
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,846
Sidewalks, mice, and hazards.


295
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,046
And remind ourselves of the


296
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,476
overall vibe that we're aiming


297
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:19,686
for.


298
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:21,766
Fun, cute, and simple.


299
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:23,446
We'll start with some big


300
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:25,216
changes and then we'll move on


301
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:28,126
to tuning the map.


302
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:31,026
So, first up, our buildings.


303
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,066
I like this color of blue,


304
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:33,786
personally.


305
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:35,386
But it's really not working here


306
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:36,296
for two reasons.


307
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:39,276
First many map users associate


308
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:41,256
blue with water, making this


309
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,486
neighborhood look like some


310
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:44,066
strange collection of pools.


311
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,266
And second, I think the color is


312
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,296
distracting here.


313
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:48,776
Remember that the building


314
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,926
polygons are really only here to


315
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:52,686
give us some context and fill


316
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:55,826
out the city blocks a bit.


317
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:57,916
This gray is more subdued, and


318
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:59,686
it lets other elements stand out


319
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:00,126
better.


320
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:01,726
But remember, there are those


321
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,046
two important buildings.


322
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:05,206
Let's restyle Pantera's house


323
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,406
and the pet store too.


324
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,026
And for the pet store we'll add


325
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:11,446
a heart that matches the health


326
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:12,866
indicator as a visual cue.


327
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:16,886
Okay. Now to restyle the parks.


328
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:18,586
They're really prominent right


329
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,216
now, but they're not as


330
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:21,646
important as the sidewalks,


331
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:22,776
mice, or hazards.


332
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:24,986
It makes sense to leave the park


333
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,126
polygons green, since this color


334
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,726
is often associated with parks.


335
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:30,586
But I'm not satisfied with the


336
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:31,046
shade.


337
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:32,426
It's too dark and that makes it


338
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,196
distracting.


339
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,386
Okay, I think this lighter green


340
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,516
is a nice change.


341
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,856
White still seems like a good


342
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,046
color for the sidewalks.


343
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:42,926
Notice how it's standing out


344
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,336
against the dark background.


345
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:45,756
But I think we should bump up


346
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:46,466
the line weight.


347
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:48,706
Yeah, better.


348
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:54,206
Okay. So, the so the base map is


349
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:56,286
more muted now, and that means


350
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,976
that we can turn our attention


351
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,666
to the symbols and game


352
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:00,426
elements.


353
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:02,846
We need to talk about the


354
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,436
photos.


355
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:05,786
They're cute, but I don't really


356
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:06,616
think that they're the best


357
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:07,406
choice.


358
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:08,856
The colors are kind of


359
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:10,766
distracting and there's a lot of


360
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:11,386
detail.


361
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,476
Remember, maps are an abstracted


362
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,156
representation of a place.


363
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,246
We don't have to be literal.


364
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,606
We often use simple symbols in


365
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:20,896
maps.


366
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,946
So, let's try a drawing of a


367
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:23,686
mouse instead.


368
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:27,036
I think this is better in line


369
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,246
with our fun and simple


370
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:28,866
aesthetic.


371
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:30,486
But now we need to make sure


372
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:31,506
that the other symbols match


373
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,016
too.


374
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:37,096
So, we'll switch up our dogs,


375
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,066
and now the fountains.


376
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:43,956
Notice that we lost some detail


377
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:44,266
here.


378
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,466
When we were showing the


379
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,276
fountains as photos, they were


380
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:49,346
different sizes.


381
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,366
But, this is a pretty simple


382
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:51,906
game.


383
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:53,386
So, our fountains don't deal


384
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,816
different amounts of damage.


385
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,716
We're simplifying the map here


386
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,336
by having the symbols match.


387
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,776
Also, if we had sized their


388
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,266
placement symbols the way we did


389
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,786
the photos, the fountain in the


390
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,446
larger park would be the biggest


391
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:07,026
symbol on the map, which would


392
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,356
suggest that it's way more


393
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,266
important than it actually is.


394
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:13,476
Okay, now to change Pantera from


395
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,016
a photo to a symbol.


396
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,576
Still pretty cute.


397
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:22,826
So, this map is coming right


398
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,246
along.


399
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:25,116
We've moved away from the


400
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:27,226
realism of the photos to some


401
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,566
symbols that are easier to


402
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,356
perceive at just a glance.


403
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,626
But now, let's tackle those game


404
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:33,256
elements.


405
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,096
They're just floating around at


406
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,346
the top of the screen where we


407
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:37,906
placed them initially, and I


408
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,496
think that's kind of confusing.


409
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,016
We don't need to do a lot to


410
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:42,216
restyle them because I think


411
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:42,996
they're looking pretty good


412
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,956
already, but let's collect them


413
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,466
and make it really clear that


414
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,836
they're part of the game UI and


415
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,076
not part of the map.


416
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,296
So, first we'll add a shaded


417
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:51,496
bar.


418
00:12:54,136 --> 00:12:55,586
And now we're going to


419
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:57,316
reconfigure our health indicator


420
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:58,446
to fit inside of it.


421
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:00,636
Nine lives is hard to


422
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:02,466
accommodate, but could a cat


423
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,486
game really have a different


424
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:03,956
number?


425
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,566
I don't think so, we've got to


426
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:06,676
make it work.


427
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:08,466
Now, we'll adjust the color,


428
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,526
position, and size of our timer


429
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:15,746
and our mouse counter.


430
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:17,276
And now, I think we're getting


431
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:17,796
closer.


432
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:19,896
This map is shaping up to be


433
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:20,866
pretty cute and fun.


434
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,646
And it's easy for users to


435
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,186
glance at it and see the key


436
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:24,586
features.


437
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,136
But you know I think we can make


438
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:28,056
it even better.


439
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:29,936
I want to make sure that the


440
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:31,786
symbols are really standing out


441
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:33,266
against the colors of the base


442
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:33,386
map.


443
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:35,956
Remember, the goal of the game


444
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:36,936
is to collect the mice.


445
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,626
So, we can give users a helpful


446
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:41,406
cue by making them a really


447
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:42,276
eye-catching color.


448
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,486
Let's try out an orangey-yellow.


449
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,856
So, now they pop a little bit


450
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:48,096
more.


451
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,196
And let's see what else we can


452
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,096
do with color here.


453
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,406
I notice that Pantera and the


454
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:55,226
dogs have similar markings on


455
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:55,996
their faces.


456
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,806
So, let's color them so that


457
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:58,816
they're more distinct.


458
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:01,276
Pantera can be purple, like her


459
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:01,616
house.


460
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:04,436
And let's make the dogs brown.


461
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:08,216
Now the fountains look a little


462
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,126
bit out of place.


463
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:10,406
We should color them too.


464
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:12,296
We'll go for blue, they're water


465
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:12,956
after all.


466
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:18,596
Okay. So, I think we're really


467
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:19,426
getting close.


468
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,276
But this isn't quite it yet.


469
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,536
I have some concerns about the


470
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,026
dogs.


471
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:25,756
We don't want them to actually


472
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:27,306
looks scary, of course.


473
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:28,456
Remember, our game is supposed


474
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,996
to be fun and lighthearted.


475
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:31,456
But they almost look too


476
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:31,986
friendly.


477
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,356
And we want to make it clear


478
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:34,956
that players need to avoid them.


479
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:39,176
So, let's try adding some


480
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:41,926
eyebrows.


481
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:44,356
Okay. With the addition of these


482
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:46,546
dog eyebrows, I think we've got


483
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:47,436
something pretty good.


484
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:50,366
Happens all the time.


485
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:52,936
So, let's take a look back at


486
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:53,496
our progress.


487
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,156
On purpose this time.


488
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:59,456
We started here with all the


489
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:01,336
elements we knew we'd need.


490
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,516
And some that we weren't sure


491
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:02,876
about.


492
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:05,236
And then we removed some of


493
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,646
those extraneous elements to get


494
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:08,506
here.


495
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,556
This is getting clearer, but


496
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,706
it's not really done yet.


497
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,706
Then we restyled the elements


498
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:20,266
that we kept and we ended up


499
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:20,736
here.


500
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:24,376
Notice that the data is very


501
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:24,966
similar.


502
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,976
We've changed the way that we've


503
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:29,566
depicted it, but it's a lot of


504
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:30,896
the same information just


505
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,926
presented in a different way.


506
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:36,586
So, thinking back to those


507
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,636
initial goals, is this map


508
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:39,516
successful?


509
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:41,596
Is it immediately apparent what


510
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:42,536
matters most?


511
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:44,516
Does it look kind of fun and


512
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:44,836
cute?


513
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,756
Do you think players will be


514
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,736
able to understand what is where


515
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,196
and what it means with just a


516
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:50,476
glance?


517
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:52,966
These are the kinds of questions


518
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,256
to ask yourself throughout your


519
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,066
design process.


520
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:57,306
Make sure that you're taking


521
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,786
every opportunity to show your


522
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,446
map to other people and get


523
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:01,446
their feedback too.


524
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:03,826
Maybe your friends, family, and


525
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,296
colleagues will agree that your

map is nailing all those goals.


527
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,866
Maybe they'll feel like it's


528

531
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,006
satisfied.

about knowing your audience,

leaving out the things that they


542
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:48,716
don't really need, and making it


543
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,396
clear with visual hierarchy,


544
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:51,506
what matters most.
