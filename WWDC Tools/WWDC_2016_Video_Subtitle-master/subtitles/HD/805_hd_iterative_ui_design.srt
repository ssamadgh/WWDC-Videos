[ Applause ]


3
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:29,896
>> Good morning everyone.


4
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:30,476
Wow it's loud.


5
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:32,136
Thank you all for coming.


6
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,786
We're really excited to be here.


7
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,166
My name is Ryan Olshavsky.


8
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:38,326
And with me down
there is Jonathan Cho.


9
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,056
We're designers on an
iWork team at Apple


10
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:44,076
where we make the Numbers,
Pages, and Keynote apps


11
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:46,356
for Mac, iOS, and iCloud.


12
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:51,506
Jon and I have been
designing software interfaces


13
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:54,546
for quite a while both
at Apple and elsewhere.


14
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:57,126
And if there's one thing
that we've learned on all


15
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:02,636
of our years of experience, it's
that good design is not easy.


16
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,946
And I know that sounds like
something a designer would say


17
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,136
because it's good
for our job security


18
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,326
if everybody believes this.


19
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:14,066
And maybe some of you have seen
what designers do and thought,


20
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,226
well that doesn't look too hard.


21
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:20,266
And you're right a lot of times
great design can see obvious


22
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,486
or effortless.


23
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,386
But what makes design difficult
are the questions you have


24
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,626
to answer to do it well.


25
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,936
Questions like, what
are we making?


26
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,116
Who is it for?


27
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:34,286
Does it actually work?


28
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,396
And did we get it right?


29
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:42,006
These questions do not
have obvious answers.


30
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,486
And they're always
challenging even


31
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:46,126
for the most experienced
designers.


32
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,576
And if you're a solo developer,
or you're the only designer


33
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,466
on your team, or if you just
never really designed anything


34
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,956
before, trying to answer
these questions can be a


35
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:55,926
daunting task.


36
00:01:56,386 --> 00:02:00,486
But we do it anyway, because
as you know design matters,


37
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:04,966
it's important and it can have
a profound impact on the quality


38
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:07,726
of your app and on
the people who use it.


39
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:12,316
A poorly thought out design
can turn the most basic


40
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:15,776
and obvious interaction
into a frustrating


41
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:17,796
and potentially embarrassing
experience.


42
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,796
A great design, on
the other hand,


43
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,286
can transform an
intimidating and difficult task


44
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:27,736
into something simple,
approachable, and elegant.


45
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:29,896
Even when it's based


46
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:33,686
on something extraordinarily
complex under the hood.


47
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:38,556
Now unfortunately there are
no shortcuts to great design.


48
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,916
There's no magic button you
can press to turn a bunch


49
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,456
of disparate features
into a compelling


50
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,526
and successful product.


51
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,976
Design is not effortless.


52
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:51,986
It takes time, commitment,
concentration and rigor.


53
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:56,366
But the good news is there are
ways to make design easier.


54
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,896
There are tools, techniques
and methods you can use


55
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:03,476
to mitigate uncertainty
and help you get


56
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:05,056
to a great design sooner.


57
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:09,476
So today, Jon and I are going to
share with you a few techniques


58
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,446
and methods that we use on our
team, in our own design work


59
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,456
to help you find answers
to a few common questions.


60
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:19,236
Specifically, what
are we making?


61
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:21,696
Where do we start?


62
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:25,426
And what's the right design.


63
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:29,236
So first, what are we making?


64
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,306
We're going to start
with this one


65
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:33,046
because if you can answer this
question it makes all the other


66
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,706
questions a lot easier.


67
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:38,686
So maybe you have a bunch
of amazing features,


68
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:41,696
but can't decide which
ones are worth building.


69
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,336
Or maybe you've identified a
potentially lucrative audience,


70
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,006
but don't know exactly what
functionality the people


71
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,216
in that audience want or need.


72
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,956
Or maybe you've built a
really awesome map already,


73
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:53,916
but don't know who
exactly it's for.


74
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:58,186
A powerful way to answer those
questions is to define your app.


75
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:04,916
That is, take all the things you
can imagine your app could do.


76
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,666
Identify the features that
matter most to the people


77
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,916
who will use your
app, and the features


78
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,736
that serve your own
goals for the app itself,


79
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:19,995
in order to determine
what your app should do.


80
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:24,066
So as an example, throughout
this session Jon and I are going


81
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,386
to pretend to design an app.


82
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:30,536
And how many of you here
have been to Caffé Macs?


83
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,736
Great. Well, if you haven't
Caffé Macs is the cafeteria


84
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,816
down in Apple Headquarters
in Cupertino.


85
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:40,156
It has a rotating menu
of freshly prepared food


86
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:41,996
and most Apply employees
eat there every day.


87
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:46,106
But a lot of people walk down
to the café, stand in line,


88
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,936
order their food, pay for their
food and then just take it back


89
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,436
to their desk and eat there.


90
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:52,936
So to make it a little
easier for those people,


91
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,176
we're going to design
an app for a new service


92
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,996
that lets employees order a meal


93
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,026
and have it delivered
directly to their office.


94
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,166
Which is pretty cool.


95
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:04,266
So, fair warning, you're
going to see a lot of pictures


96
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:06,856
of food coming up, so if you
weren't able to get breakfast


97
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,426
or a snack before the
session, I apologize for that.


98
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:13,216
So, let's go through the
process of defining this app.


99
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:15,736
So like I said first,
we need to identify,


100
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:20,516
and collect all the features
we think our app could have.


101
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,076
So you want to include
anything that's obvious.


102
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,746
So we're pretty sure we'll
need a menu of entrees,


103
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,626
details about those entrees
and a way to place an order.


104
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:33,456
But you also, and include
basically anything else.


105
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:36,066
Capture all the features
you think you


106
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,266
and your audience might
like to see in your app.


107
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:41,596
So in our case we might want
a way to schedule delivery,


108
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:46,346
see ratings, quickly
reorder meals.


109
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,956
Maybe we could offer
a catering service.


110
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:48,786
And so on.


111
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:51,826
There aren't any good or bad
ideas at this stage so feel free


112
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:53,696
to include anything you want.


113
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,856
And then once you have
your list you actually want


114
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,986
to set it aside for a little bit
because the next thing you need


115
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,896
to do is figure out
who you're designing


116
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,146
for and what they need.


117
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,766
Now this can often be
one of the hardest steps,


118
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:09,396
because it's not uncommon
for people on the same team


119
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:12,466
to have completely
different ideas in their mind


120
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,906
about who is going
to be using your app.


121
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:18,256
But without a shared
understanding


122
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:23,366
of who your user is, and what
their goals are you might end


123
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:27,066
up with a hodgepodge of features
that nobody needs, or worse,


124
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:29,316
you might spend a lot of time
and effort building an app


125
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:33,196
that nobody knows about because
you targeted the wrong audience.


126
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,266
So let's start with a
couple of simple tips.


127
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,556
First, you are not the user.


128
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:43,576
You might be a user of your app,
but if you design for yourself,


129
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,346
you risk building in
preconceptions and biases


130
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:47,626
about the user experience


131
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,946
that might be completely
wrong for everyone else.


132
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:54,386
For example, I'm an Apple
employee and I'll be a user


133
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:56,406
of the Caffé Macs app
that we're going to design,


134
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:59,486
but I almost exclusively
eat cheeseburgers.


135
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,836
And if I were to design the
app for my interest alone,


136
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:06,176
I'd put the burger of the
day at the top of the screen,


137
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,306
and that would be it because
that's all I really care about.


138
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:13,386
And that would be great for me,
but maybe not so much for people


139
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:16,996
who prefer salad, or who like
fish, or whatever else it is


140
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:18,486
that normal people eat.


141
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,256
Designing for yourself
distracts you


142
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:24,616
from what matters
most to everyone else.


143
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,316
But the opposite is also true.


144
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,516
Your audience should
not be everyone,


145
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,486
because this is too
vague, it doesn't allow you


146
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,896
to draw any meaningful
conclusions


147
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:38,226
about what would be most
important, or most valuable


148
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:39,736
to the real people
who will use your app.


149
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:44,196
Instead you need to focus on
the essential characteristics


150
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:45,576
of your target audience.


151
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,476
And one way to do that is


152
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,646
to image you're interviewing
someone who's going


153
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:52,916
to use your app to
find out what they like


154
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,296
and what they don't like,
and what they care about.


155
00:07:56,436 --> 00:08:00,796
In our case, we might ask our
customer do they prefer a fresh


156
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:02,616
meal, or something
off the shelf?


157
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,546
Do they like to take
a leisurely lunch,


158
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:06,416
or just grab something
between meetings?


159
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,246
Do they get the same
thing every day?


160
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:11,736
Or do they like to try
something new and different?


161
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,496
And do they prefer
to eat healthy food?


162
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,846
Or do they just pickup
whatever looks good?


163
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:20,676
Try to capture a range
of characteristics


164
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,206
in a few questions like these.


165
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:29,126
And then pick the answers that
best reflect the people you want


166
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,226
to serve with your app.


167
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,586
You can use your instinct
and expertise to do this,


168
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,106
and if you have user
research or marketing data,


169
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,866
you can use that to
inform your choices too.


170
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,626
In our case, it's already pretty
easy to walk down to the Caffé


171
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,346
and get a premade
salad or sandwich.


172
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:48,066
So, instead, we want to focus
on the people who are looking


173
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:52,506
for a quick interesting, fresh,
and healthy meal every day.


174
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:57,066
Once you know the
characteristics


175
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,156
of your customer, you
can rephrase those


176
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,026
as a set of goals.


177
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:04,916
So, our customer goals
are to eat a fresh meal,


178
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,586
eat quickly, or sorry.


179
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:09,846
Enjoy a fresh meal, eat
quickly, try something new,


180
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,276
and make healthy choices.


181
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,416
Articulating your
audiences' goals


182
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,296
like this will help you focus


183
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,376
on their needs throughout
the design process.


184
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,506
But what about you?


185
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:24,366
What about your goals as an app
developer, or a product owner?


186
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:27,786
Maybe you want people to
rely on your app every day.


187
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:32,326
Or maybe you want it to be a
super fun app to play with.


188
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:35,446
Or maybe you want it
to be blazing fast.


189
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,716
You want to capture those
characteristics too,


190
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:45,026
as app goals that describe what
you think your app should be


191
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,786
like, how it should feel


192
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,596
and what makes it
memorable, or unique.


193
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:53,436
So our app goals might be


194
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:56,876
to provide a convenient
simple delivery service,


195
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:59,966
so people don't have to walk
all the way to the café.


196
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,676
We want to highlight
the daily entrees


197
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,086
so customers know
all the great options


198
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:05,996
that are available to them.


199
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,676
And we want Caffé Macs
diners to be happy, of course,


200
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:10,886
so they keep coming back.


201
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:14,246
Now, note that this list
does not include things like,


202
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:17,486
be profitable, or earn a
great return on investment,


203
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:20,976
or optimize food costs.


204
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,636
While those are important goals
from a business standpoint,


205
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:27,226
they don't really provide
any meaningful direction


206
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,646
for the design.


207
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:32,976
And that's because business
goals describe what you want


208
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:35,526
to get out of your app
after you release it.


209
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:39,396
App goals on the other
hand describe the qualities


210
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:42,926
of experience you want
your users to have.


211
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:45,676
You need to understand both
types of goals, of course.


212
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:49,186
But it's your app goals that
will inspire and motivate you


213
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:50,986
to design and build
a great product.


214
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,716
All right so finally, to figure


215
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,786
out what exactly
our app should do,


216
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,106
we need to consider all those
features we came up with


217
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,686
in step one from the perspective


218
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:05,136
of our customer goals
and our app goals.


219
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,516
So, here's our list again.


220
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,676
And by looking at each one
of these in the context


221
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,996
of our goals, you can pretty
quickly identify the ones


222
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,256
that are appropriate
for our app.


223
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,876
So, in addition to the
basic functionality,


224
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,436
we can also include an
entree rating system


225
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:25,026
that serves our customers'
goals, finding something new


226
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:25,876
and interesting to eat.


227
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,896
And a feedback link
serves our own app goals


228
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,686
of making diners happy
because it gives them a way


229
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:34,866
to let us know if
they're satisfied or not.


230
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,826
By the same method we
can also exclude features


231
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,146
that do not serve our goals.


232
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,976
Now this isn't to say
that these are bad ideas,


233
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,846
or that they're not
worth doing some day,


234
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,386
they just don't fit our
current definition of our app.


235
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,536
So we can set them aside
for now and maybe get back


236
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:51,786
to them in a future release.


237
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,826
All right, check this out.


238
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,276
Now that we actually
have a list of features


239
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:58,236
and we know what we're making.


240
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:02,146
We have a nice succinct
set of functionality based


241
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:06,056
on a solid understanding of
what's most important to us,


242
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:09,356
and what's going to matter to
the people who will use our app.


243
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,906
And so now to tell
you more about how


244
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,076
to actually start
designing your features,


245
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:15,416
I'm going to hand
things over to Jon.


246
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:21,836
[ Applause ]


247
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:22,886
>> Thank you Ryan.


248
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:27,196
So now that know
what we're making,


249
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,346
let's start designing our app.


250
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,256
But where do we start?


251
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:36,326
Well what I like to do is I
like to start with what I know.


252
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,846
You might not know how all
of your app is going to look


253
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,566
or work yet, but
there's probably one


254
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,296
or two things you
do know you'll need


255
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:44,056
and you can start
by designing that.


256
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:49,016
For example, if you're designing
a messaging app, you might want


257
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,426
to start by designing
the conversation screen,


258
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:53,246
because you know that's where
a lot of people are going


259
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:54,076
to be spending their time.


260
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,506
Or, if you're designing a
dating app, you might start


261
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:00,096
by designing the profile
screen, because you know


262
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,816
that that's going to be a
big part of your experience.


263
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:07,666
In our case, I'm designing
a food delivery app.


264
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,156
So I don't know much
about what I need,


265
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:13,906
but I know at the very least,
I'm going to need a menu of food


266
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,726
so that people can
order from it.


267
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,466
So I'll start by
designing the menu screen.


268
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:24,546
So for this demo, I'm going
to design UI in Keynote.


269
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,036
You might already know Keynote
as a great presentation app,


270
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:31,786
but it's also a great
app to draw UI.


271
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:34,706
It creates layouts very easily,


272
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:36,516
you can try out different
animations.


273
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,596
You can even make
interactive prototypes


274
00:13:38,596 --> 00:13:39,796
that you can load
onto your phone.


275
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:44,196
In our group, we like Keynote
so much that we design all


276
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:45,526
of our apps using Keynote.


277
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:49,306
In fact, even Keynote was
designed using Keynote.


278
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:51,476
Think about that.


279
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:55,546
[ Applause ]


280
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,506
That shouldn't even be possible.


281
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,546
But it is because
Keynote is awesome.


282
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:07,226
So, let's start drawing UI.


283
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:11,536
UI is made up of a
couple of simple elements.


284
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,276
It's made up of shapes and lines


285
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,276
and I can insert those
from my top here.


286
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:17,206
I can just tap to
insert a shape.


287
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:18,996
I can tap to insert a line.


288
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:21,486
UI also has text.


289
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,476
And I can insert
text by clicking


290
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:24,926
on this and get a textbox.


291
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:28,346
And UI also has images.


292
00:14:29,146 --> 00:14:32,676
On my desktop I have
a folder of food


293
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:34,096
and I can just drag
it into Keynote.


294
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:37,066
And I can resize that.


295
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:41,826
Great. So to start, I'm just
going to start with a shape.


296
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,306
I'm going to copy
and paste a shape.


297
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:48,546
I'm going to change its
size to 375 by 667 points,


298
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,856
because this is the
resolution of an iPhone 6.


299
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:56,706
And I'm going to make it white
and put it right on the center.


300
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:59,896
So in just 30 seconds I've
already designed a simple


301
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:00,306
iPhone app.


302
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:02,566
It's a flashlight.


303
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,006
Ha,ha [laughter].


304
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:06,086
I'm just kidding.


305
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,496
So I'm going to draw a menu
screen, and one thing I


306
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:14,136
like to do is I like to take
screenshots of apps that I use


307
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:15,216
and use them as references.


308
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:19,586
So here I have a screenshot
that I took of my messages app.


309
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,876
So I'm just going
to drag that in.


310
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:24,336
It comes in a little large
because it's retina resolution.


311
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:27,386
So I'm just going to resize it.


312
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,356
And I'm going to put this next
to my screen that I'm drawing.


313
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:35,016
And now that I have
this screenshot next


314
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,026
to what I'm drawing, I
can use it as a reference.


315
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:40,836
So I'm going to start by
taking shapes and outlining


316
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,696
out the layout of my screen.


317
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:47,426
So I'm just going to resize
this box to be a header square.


318
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:50,326
I turned on my accessibility
zoom functionality


319
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:52,846
in system preferences so I
could zoom in really quickly


320
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:55,456
and make sure that
everything is pixel perfect.


321
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,896
Okay. I'm going to do
the same thing for lines.


322
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:05,546
I know that this
line is 1 point.


323
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,076
Again, I'm going to zoom


324
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:16,686
in to make sure it is
exactly where I want it.


325
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,346
Great and now I'm just going


326
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,936
to start duplicating this
line a bunch of times.


327
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:27,716
I don't really care where
it's positioned right now.


328
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:28,746
I can be a little bit sloppy,


329
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:30,996
because I'll clean
that up later.


330
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,936
The only one I do care
about is this last line.


331
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:39,956
I want to make sure that
this last line is exactly


332
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,886
where I want it.


333
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:46,426
Great, because now I can
just select all of my lines


334
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:50,976
and space them out evenly,
and the line then to the left.


335
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,436
So that was a really quick way


336
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,666
to just get all my lines
in place [applause].


337
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:58,866
Oh, okay. That was not
even the impressive part.


338
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,726
So now I want to change
the colors of my lines


339
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:03,716
and I can do that here.


340
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:04,945
I can make it gray.


341
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:06,826
Or if I wanted to
use a specific color,


342
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,596
I could use the system
color picker,


343
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,096
and use the eyedropper tool.


344
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:13,476
This turns my mouse
into a magnifying glass


345
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:16,516
and now I can click on a
specific color on my screen


346
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:18,796
and it will use that
color for the line.


347
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,606
And now I'll do the same
thing with my header bar.


348
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,086
I'll get this light gray.


349
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,156
So I've already got the outline


350
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,715
of the screen that
I want to draw.


351
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:30,846
So the next thing I want
to do is match the text.


352
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:34,736
So I'm going to take this
text box, and I can try


353
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:37,336
to match the style of the
text of the messages app.


354
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:42,136
So I can start by just typing in
the text that I want to match.


355
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:45,126
You can see that the font
and the size is incorrect.


356
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:50,556
I know that iPhone system
font is San Francisco.


357
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,476
So I can set it to
San Francisco.


358
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,536
And I'm just going to
make this font smaller.


359
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,086
It looks like what I'm trying
to match is actually semi-bold.


360
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:03,446
And I could actually
just zoom in there


361
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,586
and make sure that it is exact.


362
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:07,936
Great. So it looks like
a pretty close match.


363
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:11,666
I can do the same
thing for this subtext.


364
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:22,866
Close enough.


365
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:28,406
Okay. So now I've got my
text looking like the text


366
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:31,586
on my screenshot, and
this actually looks,


367
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:37,016
maybe like it's gray so I'm
going to drop the opacity a bit.


368
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:39,666
So now the next thing I want


369
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,996
to do is start putting
content into my UI.


370
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,096
I've got this text file


371
00:18:45,096 --> 00:18:47,696
of different entree
names and descriptions.


372
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:49,616
So I'm just going to copy and
paste some of these in here.


373
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,886
Resize this.


374
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:04,326
Great. I also want to get
the title of my screen.


375
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:08,656
So I'll try to match that.


376
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:12,036
This looks like it's
actually the right size.


377
00:19:12,626 --> 00:19:13,016
That's great.


378
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:15,426
Stick this in the center.


379
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,856
And I'll call this Caffé Macs.


380
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,956
Okay. So now I've got some
pretty good text in here.


381
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,256
The next thing I want to
do is put in some images.


382
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:33,886
I'm going to take my picture
of my mahi-mahi and resize it.


383
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:39,576
Now I want to get the
sizing and the shape exact.


384
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:40,846
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going


385
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,786
to use a shape and
use it as a mask.


386
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:47,976
So I'm going to just make this
square the exact size I want.


387
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:53,936
And now, if I select
both of them,


388
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:58,936
I can crop the image
using the shape.


389
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:02,156
Going to nudge it a bit.


390
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:02,756
Excellent.


391
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:07,496
And now my picture of fish
is the exact size I wanted.


392
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:11,706
I can mask images in other ways.


393
00:20:12,056 --> 00:20:15,696
I want to get the status
bar of this screenshot.


394
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:16,576
I don't want to draw it.


395
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:19,196
So I'm just going to
duplicate this image,


396
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,546
double click the mask it


397
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:23,276
and just grab the bar
and stick it on top.


398
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:25,896
I saved myself a
couple minutes there.


399
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:30,636
And the last thing I want,
is I want this little arrow.


400
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:31,886
I've got this other trick.


401
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:34,496
I can actually take a
screenshot of any part


402
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:39,016
of my screen using the
keyboard shortcut command,


403
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:40,106
control, shift 4.


404
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,126
It's hard to remember,
but it's useful.


405
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:45,266
When I do that it turns my
mouse cursor into a camera.


406
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:48,656
And now I can just draw
a box around this arrow.


407
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:54,156
And it's copied to my clipboard
and now I can just paste that.


408
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:57,356
So that's a not well
known keyboard shortcut.


409
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,456
Great. So now I've got one row.


410
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:03,876
So I'm going to group
these together.


411
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,976
And again, I'm going to do the
same thing I did with my lines.


412
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:10,846
The only one I care about
getting right is this last one,


413
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:16,746
because I can just
select all of them,


414
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:18,886
space them out and align them.


415
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,926
Great. And now the
only thing I have


416
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:27,176
to do is replace these images
and copy paste some more content


417
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:30,406
in there to get it
looking like a real screen.


418
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:34,026
To save some time I've actually
drawn the screen beforehand.


419
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:38,316
So it looks something
like this once I swapped


420
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,686
out all of the content.


421
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:43,796
So in just I don't know, three
minutes, I drew the screen.


422
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:50,546
[ Applause ]


423
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:54,646
So I want to talk a little bit
about the exact steps I took


424
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,826
in the last couple minutes.


425
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:58,526
I started by using
screenshots as references


426
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,636
to match colors,
sizes and texts.


427
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,156
I also used screenshots
to collage bits


428
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,466
of UI that I wanted to use.


429
00:22:06,236 --> 00:22:09,316
I drew a bunch of squares and
lines, and I resized them a bit


430
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,636
and I zoomed in and
out a lot to make sure


431
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:12,676
that they were pixel perfect.


432
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:17,256
And I used believable content
so that, I used realistic photos


433
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:20,836
and texts to make my UI
look more believable.


434
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:24,806
I think with a little
bit of practice


435
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:27,066
and effort these steps
are simple enough


436
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,886
that anyone here can
do what I just did.


437
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:31,686
So now I'll hand
things back to Ryan.


438
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:38,006
[ Applause ]


439
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:39,366
>> Thank you, Jon.


440
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:40,826
Great work as always.


441
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:47,456
All right so here's our
awesome Caffé Macs menu design.


442
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,466
And we're done.


443
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,016
Right? This seems good enough.


444
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,806
Meets all the functional
criteria of a menu.


445
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:54,736
Looks great.


446
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,636
It's tempting to just
stop here and move


447
00:22:57,636 --> 00:22:59,956
onto the next feature
or the next screen.


448
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,786
But how do we actually know


449
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:05,686
if this first design
is the right design?


450
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,966
Well, I can tell you from
experience it's probably not.


451
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,826
And that's because you can't
know if your design is right


452
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,276
if you try only one idea.


453
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:19,486
Instead you need to look at
the problem from other angles


454
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:26,556
and iterate on your design to
find new insights and approaches


455
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:27,876
that you might miss otherwise.


456
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:33,016
Basically, you want to look
at your app design and ask,


457
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:34,296
what could we do differently?


458
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:38,266
So here's our design again,
what could we do differently?


459
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:42,546
Well, in our case, it's based
on, our design is based on rows


460
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,896
so one thing you can do is just
change the size of the rows.


461
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:48,246
Here by making the rows taller,
we can't fit as many entrees,


462
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:49,646
but we can make the
photos larger.


463
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:53,006
And you can also increase
or decrease the amount


464
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:54,306
of information that's
on the screen,


465
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:55,706
so here we've added the prices.


466
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:59,796
You can consider different
layouts, and adjust the amount


467
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:01,896
of white space between
your content.


468
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:04,686
That's the space around
and between the things


469
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:05,436
that are on your screen.


470
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,946
So here we've added margins
around the photos which opens


471
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,936
up the UI a little bit.


472
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,966
You can also try
different topography styles.


473
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:15,766
For example, here we're using
a larger, lighter weight font


474
00:24:16,226 --> 00:24:18,796
for the names, and we've
added some color to the prices


475
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,506
to make them stand out on
screen a little bit more.


476
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,496
You can also just go where
your curiosity takes you.


477
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,076
So, we wondered, what it the
menu didn't have pictures


478
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:28,226
of food, because why not?


479
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:29,216
It's worth a try.


480
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,766
But what we found is that
without a visual anchor


481
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:36,576
on each row, we needed to
make the entrée names bigger


482
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:39,066
and bolder, which gives
the menu a different feel.


483
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:42,036
And note that I'm not
actually judging any


484
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:42,766
of these designs yet.


485
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,756
We're just really brainstorming
with pictures to kind


486
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:46,856
of shake out new ideas.


487
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:50,726
So another technique you
can use is to do a 180.


488
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:52,996
So while this design
is very text oriented,


489
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:56,736
what about one that's
very image oriented?


490
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,246
So we have a grid
of photos here.


491
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,926
It kind of looks like a
totally different app right.


492
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:03,366
You can also think about the
proportions of your imagery


493
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:06,756
and what shapes suit
your content the best.


494
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:08,656
So while these photos
are square,


495
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:11,196
maybe wider landscape
photos work better.


496
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,806
You can also look at different
ways to contain your content.


497
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,356
Here each entrée is
on a tile or a card,


498
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:20,646
which helps them feel more like
distinct items on the screen.


499
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:24,826
Think about how you use
the space available to you,


500
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:26,636
these photos are edge-to-edge,


501
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,676
which makes the most
of the iPhone screen.


502
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:31,416
And in this layout to
fit the entree details,


503
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:33,846
we superimposed them
on the photos


504
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,346
to create a different
visual style.


505
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,256
And remember you
aren't restricted


506
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:44,886
to a uniform grid
of boxes or rows.


507
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:47,686
You can play with the size and
proportions of your content


508
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:51,326
to create completely
different effects.


509
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:53,016
You can combine ideas
to create new ones.


510
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:54,946
So, here we took the
edge-to-edge photo-style


511
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:57,856
and merged it with the list
view layout of our first design.


512
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:04,246
Think about how immersive you
want the experience to be.


513
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,786
These larger photos
dominate the screen,


514
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:09,806
which encourages the viewer to
spend more time with each one.


515
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:14,406
And if your text is critical
make sure you pay attention


516
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,396
to how readable it is.


517
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:17,346
Can somebody with
a vision impairment


518
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:19,916
or color blindness make
out the important details?


519
00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:26,506
And finally what if we took this
large photo idea to an extreme


520
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,116
so that the image takes up
basically the whole screen.


521
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:33,206
Here scrolling vertically
might be a little strange,


522
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:37,246
so instead we're using a
swipe navigation scheme


523
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:38,716
so you just swipe
between the entrees.


524
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:41,726
So, consider how your
content could be served


525
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,026
by different navigation schemes.


526
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:47,886
All right so here
are 11 alternatives


527
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:48,956
to our original design.


528
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:50,676
These were all drawn
in Keynote as well.


529
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:54,526
And you want to basically
just keep asking what can we


530
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:55,196
do differently?


531
00:26:55,596 --> 00:26:57,996
Until you've come
up and expressed


532
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,686
as many interesting alternatives
as you can come up with.


533
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,746
And again you can do that
by organizing your content


534
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:08,416
into different layouts,
playing with text size,


535
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
color, weight, and font.


536
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:13,676
Experimenting with proportions
of your content, increasing


537
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:14,576
and decreasing the amount


538
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:16,066
of information that's
on the screen.


539
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:19,736
Doing 180s and pushing
ideas to extremes.


540
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:21,406
And considering different ways


541
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:23,156
of navigating through
your content.


542
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:26,056
So the next question is,


543
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:30,046
will any of these designs
actually work for our app?


544
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:31,326
We don't know yet.


545
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:35,026
This is a step when
you and your team get


546
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,946
to actually judge your designs.


547
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:38,256
This can be the fun part.


548
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,896
So you want to set aside
your ego and your pride


549
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,226
and forget all the time you
spent drawing your mockups.


550
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:46,366
And instead pretend you're a
third party whose job it is


551
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:49,796
to evaluate and critique your
designs to find their strengths


552
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:51,846
and weaknesses, and
find the best one.


553
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:57,306
So to do that you have to
scrutinize each options


554
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,246
and ask some tricky questions.


555
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:04,226
Things like, how well
does the design serve your


556
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,216
audience's goals?


557
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:07,886
How well does it address
your own app goals?


558
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,386
And does it fit the
definition of your app?


559
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:14,616
Does the design provide people
with the right information?


560
00:28:15,016 --> 00:28:16,856
Is there enough detail
to take action?


561
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:18,016
Is it readable?


562
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:21,136
Is the design intuitive?


563
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,416
Are you using interface controls
that people are familiar with?


564
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:28,106
And are you using terminology
your audience will understand


565
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:30,046
given their context
and experience.


566
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,696
And finally, does the
design feel right?


567
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,486
Even if it meets all
the other criteria,


568
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:38,376
and it's objectively
a good design,


569
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:40,276
does it feel the
way you want it to?


570
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:43,296
Does it have the personality and
the appearance that you want?


571
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:45,226
That's just as important
as everything else.


572
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,926
These questions are
all very subjective.


573
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,426
And you will most likely
get into disagreements


574
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:54,676
with your teammates and even
yourself about the answers.


575
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:56,676
But asking these
questions and trying


576
00:28:56,676 --> 00:29:00,476
to answer them honestly
will really help lead you


577
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:02,836
to the right design.


578
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,196
So to demonstrate what
we're talking about Jon


579
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:08,746
and I are going to now critique
our own designs in front of all


580
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:11,896
of you, to find the one that
we thinks works the best.


581
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:16,186
So let's take a second
and just consider them.


582
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:18,936
All right what do you think Jon?


583
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,116
>> Looking at them side by
side, it's a little bit obvious


584
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:25,016
that some are better than others
so I think we can just go ahead


585
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,596
and eliminate a couple
right now.


586
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:26,936
>> Okay.


587
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:29,946
>> Let's get rid of A,
you know the first one.


588
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:32,306
It's pretty good, but it's
not as good as the other ones.


589
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:33,416
>> All right.


590
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,416
>> Let's get rid of D,


591
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:36,476
it doesn't have any photos,
that's wort of weird.


592
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:36,806
>> Yeah.


593
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:38,956
>> A food app, we need photos.


594
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:42,226
Let's also get rid of E.


595
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:44,136
Yeah that one has
too many photos.


596
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:46,976
It feels so crowded
and you can't even see


597
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:47,836
that much information.


598
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:51,326
>> True. I think we
can get rid of F also.


599
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,886
It has a little bit
more information,


600
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:55,176
but I think the visual layout
is maybe a little too busy


601
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:57,486
and the entree names are getting
cut off that's not great.


602
00:29:57,786 --> 00:29:58,316
>> That's a good point.


603
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:00,886
>> I think we can get rid
of option I, the proportions


604
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:03,436
of those photos are
kind of interesting,


605
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,956
but you can't really see
enough of the food to know


606
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:06,936
if it looks good or not.


607
00:30:07,276 --> 00:30:07,476
>> Okay.


608
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:10,236
>> And then option L, even
though I love the big photo,


609
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,126
I think paging through 12


610
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,526
or 15 different entrees
is probably just going


611
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,766
to be too tedious so I think we
should get rid of that one too.


612
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:17,076
>> I agree.


613
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:20,776
>> All right now we're down
to six, that's good progress.


614
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,146
All right [laughter].


615
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:28,336
Didn't take very long at all.


616
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:30,646
All right so let's look
at the rest of them


617
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:31,866
in a little more detail.


618
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:34,856
So between these two,
they're actually very similar,


619
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,116
they're very functionally
similar.


620
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:39,986
I would say that maybe option B
is a little more conventional,


621
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:44,546
maybe more what people expect
from a menu on an iPhone.


622
00:30:44,546 --> 00:30:46,966
And I actually like the
edge-to-edge photos.


623
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:47,686
I think that's a nice look.


624
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,006
>> You know I actually
like option C.


625
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,726
It's a little bit
more interesting.


626
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:54,586
I like how the topography
is really thin.


627
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,376
I think that's really hip now.


628
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,806
It's also cool how all


629
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,496
of the information is
aligned on the left.


630
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:04,556
It's really each to just scan
down and see names and prices.


631
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:07,936
And I sort of like the
feel of it being more open


632
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,896
and feeling a little
bit more fresh.


633
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:13,246
>> Yeah. I think, yeah
those are good points.


634
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:13,536
Thank you.


635
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:13,826
>> Thank you.


636
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:14,736
>> You've convinced me.


637
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,906
All right let's get
rid of option B.


638
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:22,366
This is totally ad lib
by the way [laughter].


639
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:24,366
>> Okay these two look
pretty similar as well,


640
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,276
they both have edge-to-edge
photos.


641
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,376
G has more of a grid layout,


642
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,296
while H looks more
like a bento box.


643
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,386
I really like, I really like H.


644
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:36,536
You know there's a lot of
different sizes and variety.


645
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:37,566
It feels really fun.


646
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:42,256
>> [Sigh] Yeah H looks cool,
but I think it has a fatal slaw,


647
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,266
which is that some of these
entrees look more important


648
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:44,686
than others.


649
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:46,126
Like, we really want you


650
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,966
to buy grilled mahi-mahi
with this design.


651
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,316
And that's not really the case.


652
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:50,626
These should all
be equal options.


653
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:53,996
I think if we like this style,
I think G does a better job


654
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,846
with balancing this
edge-to-edge look


655
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:59,496
with the actual functional
intent of the app.


656
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,156
>> I still really like
H though [laughter],


657
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,976
but I think you make
good points.


658
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:04,946
>> Yeah.


659
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:05,756
>> I think we should go with G.


660
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:06,666
>> All right fair enough.


661
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:13,076
All right so between these
two, I actually really like J,


662
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,736
like I've said the edge-to-edge
photo thing is doing it for me.


663
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:18,966
And I love that this reminds
me of like a food magazine,


664
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:20,266
which I think is a
really cool style.


665
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,466
>> Ryan, we are not designing
a food magazine here,


666
00:32:23,946 --> 00:32:25,736
we are designing a delivery app.


667
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,046
You can't even see
the words in J.


668
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:30,576
I like how K has a better
balance of photos and text.


669
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:34,456
Because it just seems more
relevant, and more appetizing.


670
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,616
>> All right I see
what you mean.


671

I'll give you K.

00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:40,546
All right.


673
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:42,226
>> Okay, good.

>> Compromise.

down to our top three,

00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,946
>> They look pretty good,
but you know seeing them side


679
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:56,066
by side, I think it's
sort of obvious now


680
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,656
that G is not that great.


681
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,876
These descriptions are
actually really useful to sort


682
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:03,466
of tell people what the food is.


683
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:06,176
And G just seems really
lacking in that regard.


684
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:10,096
>> Yeah. Seeing them all
together, I think you're right.


685
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,506
Even though I love the
edge-to-edge photo I think


686
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:13,416
having the descriptions,


687
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,676
the more information really
makes a better experience


688
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:16,886
so I guess we'll get rid of G.


689
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:17,446
>> Okay.

we're down to C and K


691
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:22,236
in just a few minutes
we've gotten


692
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,946
down to just two options
which is pretty cool.


693
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:27,106
These two are also very
functionally similar.


694
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,066
They both look great I think.


695
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:33,446
They do have pretty
different feel between them.


696
00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:36,306
I don't actually, I
don't have a favorite


697
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,206
of these two, how about you?


698
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:41,456
>> Well [laughter], oh
I can't tell either.


699
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,976
They both look pretty good.


700
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:43,476
>> All right.


701
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:45,626
Well we were actually
worried it might come to this.


702
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:48,226
And so maybe all
of you can help us.


703
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:53,166
So given all of the, now you've
seen us critique our own designs


704
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:56,026

criteria we've been considering,

is the better design?

708
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,545

K is the better design?

710
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:15,766
All right well I think
K pretty clearly won,


711
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:17,146
which is pretty convenient
for us [laughter].


712
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:23,036
All right so our
congratulations, option K.


713
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:27,226
Good job. So we've determined
as a large design team here


714
00:34:27,226 --> 00:34:30,985
that option K is the
best combination maybe


715
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,846
of functionality, efficiency,


716
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:34,696
and the general feel we'd
like the app to have.


717
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,866
So now have we actually
found the right design?


718
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,835
Well, we're on our way, right,
but one screen is not an app.


719
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:45,226
We now actually have to figure
out how this thing works.


720
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:46,786
So to tell you more about that,


721
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:47,815
I'm going to give
this back to Jon.


722
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:50,286
>> Thank you [applause].


723
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:54,976
We need to design a workflow.


724
00:34:55,516 --> 00:34:58,356
A workflow is a set of steps
it takes to complete a task.


725
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,436
In my case the task
is to order food.


726
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:07,266
So let's go back to the
design we just choose.


727
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:12,196
I think I'll take my
advice from before and start


728
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,136
with what I know here.


729
00:35:13,706 --> 00:35:15,506
I don't know much about
what this is supposed to do,


730
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:18,266
but I do one thing,
that if I tap on one


731
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,906
of those entrees I probably
should see more information


732
00:35:20,906 --> 00:35:21,356
about that.


733
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:24,696
So I'll go ahead and I'll
design a detail screen.


734
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:27,406
And maybe it looks
something like this.


735
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:31,356
Okay. So now that I'm here,


736
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:33,196
I probably need a
way to order food.


737
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,786
So I'll put in an Order button.


738
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:39,076
And maybe it will just go on the
bottom of the screen for now.


739
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:40,306
Excellent.


740
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:44,016
And now what happens if I
tap on this Order button?


741
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:46,226
Well, I don't know.


742
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:48,746
Maybe I'll just finish the order


743
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:50,546
and let the user know
that they're done.


744
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:53,206
So, I've designed a workflow.


745
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:56,286
It looks pretty good.


746
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:59,926
I think it gets the job
done of ordering food.


747
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,466
But you know now
that I look at it,


748
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:03,796
I think there's some problems.


749
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:06,686
It's actually missing a
little bit of functionality


750
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:08,366
that we talked about before.


751
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:12,846
You can't actually change order
details, where it's going to,


752
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:15,446
or when it's going to come,
so that's a little bit weird.


753
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:19,746
And now that I look at it, the
commitment is really abrupt.


754
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:23,356
After I hit the order button,
I've already spent $10.


755
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:25,156
There's probably
a rule somewhere


756
00:36:25,156 --> 00:36:26,366
that says you shouldn't do that.


757
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:29,066
So I think there's
a lot of things


758
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,646
that maybe this workflow
could do better


759
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,646
so let's try that again.


760
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:37,536
So, in a couple apps I've
seen the shopping cart model.


761
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,366
So I think I'm going to
borrow that for this one.


762
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:43,066
So in the upper right hand
corner now there's a shopping


763
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:43,716
cart icon.


764
00:36:44,226 --> 00:36:47,936
And now if I tap in food
there's an Add to Cart button.


765
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,536
And now I could tap that,


766
00:36:50,536 --> 00:36:52,226
the button will say it's
been added to the cart.


767
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:54,606
And my icon will
change to let me know


768
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:55,376
that there's something in it.


769
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:58,046
It seems like a pretty
conventional behavior,


770
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:58,926
so that's really nice.


771
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,176
I think people will
know how to use that.


772
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:05,836
And now if I tap on the shopping
cart icon I can show the user a


773
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:07,016
summary of their order.


774
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:11,086
And from here they could maybe
change the options as well as,


775
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:13,226
to get a confirmation
that they're


776
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:15,616
about to spend 11.68 for food.


777
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:19,746
And now if they tap Place
Order, I can show them


778
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:23,986
that the orders complete and
give them information about it.


779
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,366
So, now my work flow
looks something like this.


780
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:29,336
It addresses the problems
I mentioned before.


781
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:33,106
It lets me know the
details of my order,


782
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:36,056
and it does not make the
ordering feel too abrupt.


783
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,026
It lets the user know
what's happening,


784
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:39,046
so I think that's really nice.


785
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:42,936
But you know I don't think this
workflow is that good either,


786
00:37:43,306 --> 00:37:46,026
it's actually a whole lot of
steps for something as simple


787
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:46,966
as ordering a sandwich.


788
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:48,706
So I think we can
make it a lot shorter.


789
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:52,306
And I actually noticed,
having done this twice now


790
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:55,586
that the menu screen
does a pretty good job


791
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:58,426
of giving people
information about the food,


792
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:01,306
and they might not have
to go to the detail screen


793
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:03,406
to actually figure out
if they want to order it.


794
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:06,826
So maybe the user can determine


795
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,116
to order the food right
from the menu screen.


796
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:10,706
So let's try this again,


797
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,976
let's try to make
this workflow shorter.


798
00:38:14,176 --> 00:38:18,376
So here, I put the Buy buttons
right on the menu screen,


799
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:19,916
because that seems like
enough information.


800
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,496
And now if the user taps
on one of those buttons,


801
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:26,396
maybe we keep the shopping cart
model, but instead of an icon


802
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:27,866
in the corner, it's
now this little tray


803
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:28,836
that comes up on bottom.


804
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:32,306
Here, I could actually show
information about the order,


805
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:34,736
and even let them
finish ordering it right


806
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:35,516
from the menu screen.


807
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,906
If they want to I guess, they
could just still swipe it up


808
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,706
and see the full
details of their orders


809
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:41,736
and the different options.


810
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:45,206
But I think for the most part,
this might be enough information


811
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,246
for someone to figure
out if they want


812
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:48,016
to complete this order.


813
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,286
And I could actually extend
this further, if the user taps


814
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:57,046
on the Order button, I could
use the same little tray


815
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,466
and show the confirmation
status.


816
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,996
So now, the workflow
looks something like this.


817
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:07,136
It's three steps, but
it feels a lot shorter


818
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,326
because all that's
happening on the menu screen.


819
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:13,996
And it still has all
of the functionality


820
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:17,796
as the previous design, but
now all of that's optional


821
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:19,656
under the tray rather
than forcing it


822
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,176
to be a mandatory
step for the user.


823
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:24,496
So that's really nice.


824
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:27,166
So I think this workflow
is pretty good.


825
00:39:27,196 --> 00:39:29,216
I think it gets the job
done of ordering food


826
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,506
and I think it does
it very quickly.


827
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:35,196
Notice how to design this,
I used the same principles


828
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:36,306
that we talked about before.


829
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:39,986
I started with what I knew and
then I evaluated and iterated


830
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,816
on all my designs until I ended


831
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:44,456
up with something
I was happy with.


832
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:46,586
So now to wrap things up, let
me give this back to Ryan.

I can't wait to use
our pretend app.

only have a couple minutes.

a few key points to you today.

00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:07,776
It can be a lot of fun,
but it takes time, energy,


840
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,186
and thoughtful deliberation.


841
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:12,096
But by using the methods
we've shared with you today,


842
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,476
it can be a little bit easier.


843
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,806
If you're trying to figure out
what the heck are we making?


844
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:20,546
Define your audience's goals
and your own app goals.


845
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:22,356
And then use those to
choose the features


846
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:24,146
that best serve everyone's
needs.


847
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,006
If you know what
you want to make,


848
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:28,646
but don't know what
the UI should look


849
00:40:28,646 --> 00:40:30,476
or feel like, just
start drawing.


850
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,916
Start with what you do
know and build from there.


851
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:34,746
It's okay if you don't have
the whole system figured


852
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:35,586
out ahead of time.


853
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:38,956
And it's our completely unbiased
opinion, but try using Keynote,


854
00:40:38,986 --> 00:40:41,096
we think you might like it.


855
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,486
And finally to find the right
design, try lots of ideas.


856
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:47,116
Don't settle for
your first concept,


857
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:49,226
or what might be good enough.


858
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,126
Then critique your
designs to determine


859
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:55,746
which options best suits
your customer goals


860
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:56,646
and your app goals.


861
00:40:57,146 --> 00:41:00,346
Keep iterating and evaluating
until the design feels right.


862
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,786
So, we hope you'll
take these techniques


863
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:05,086
and methods back
to your own work.


864
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:09,026
Give yourself the time
to explore, iterate


865
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:10,166
and critique your designs.


866
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,766
We think you'll find
it was worth it.


867
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:16,486
