[ Applause ]


3
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:31,516
>> Good morning.


4
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:33,276
>> Welcome to Create Your Own


5
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:34,756
Swift Playgrounds Subscription.


6
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:35,956
>> We hope you had a great time


7
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:37,186
at the bash last night and we


8
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:38,406
know you're all feeling bright


9
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,836
eyed and bushy tailed and ready


10
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:40,536
to learn about Swift


11
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:40,986
Playgrounds.


12
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:42,456
My name is Grace.


13
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:43,536
>> And my name is Holly.


14
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:44,766
>> I'm a software engineer on


15
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:45,476
Swift Playgrounds.


16
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:46,846
>> And I'm a software engineer


17
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:48,086
on Xcode Source Editor.


18
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:51,496
Swift Playgrounds is an app that


19
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,036
allows anyone to code on the


20
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:54,616
iPad using the Swift Programming


21
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:55,126
Language.


22
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:57,676
As authors, you can share your


23
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:59,006
Playground Books with others by


24
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:00,466
hosting your own subscription.


25
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,096
>> Today we'll be talking about


26
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:03,216
how to make a subscription


27
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:04,965
starting from making Playgrounds


28
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,206
and Playground books and moving


29
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:07,356
all the way through hosting your


30
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:09,146
content online as a feed for you


31
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:09,786
subscribers.


32
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:12,176
>> Today's session will be


33
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,756
broken up into four parts.


34
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,106
First we'll talk a quick look at


35
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:17,786
the Playground book format and


36
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,086
new Swift Playgrounds Author


37
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:20,846
Template for Xcode 9.3.


38
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:22,676
Then we'll look at the Swift


39
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:24,156
Playgrounds subscription format


40
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:25,736
and walk through how to host


41
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,146
your own feed online.


42
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:29,086
>> And I'm going to go watch you


43
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,666
from offstage so I'll see you


44
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:32,000
later.


45
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,756
>> Grace and I have been working


46
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,976
on a set of Playground books for


47
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:38,806
all of you to explore the core


48
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,986
image APIs.


49
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:41,966
Today we're going to build


50
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:43,446
another Playground book so that


51
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:45,286
all of you can explore the CI


52
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:47,086
filters, some of the built in


53
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:47,416
ones.


54
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:49,536
And here you can see me having a


55
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:51,106
lot of fun going through the


56
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:53,116
chapter of our book that teaches


57
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:54,676
about the distortion filters,


58
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:56,516
which are my personal favorites.


59
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,036
Playground books are a mechanism


60
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,706
for you to construct a guided


61
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,606
interactive exploration of a


62
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:04,676
particular topic.


63
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,726
Using a Playground book you can


64
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:07,766
guide your learners through a


65
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,425
sequence of chapters, which are


66
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:10,985
then further subdivided into


67
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:11,566
pages.


68
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,046
Each page contains a source


69
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,516
editor, which you see here on


70
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:16,026
the left.


71
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,776
And you can also choose to


72
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,956
implement an optional, always on


73
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:22,326
live view, which you see here on


74
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:22,676
the right.


75
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,776
Live views are used for


76
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:26,246
visualizing the results of


77
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,416
running the code in the source


78
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,586
editor on a page.


79
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:32,056
To bundle all of this into a


80
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,386
single file, we use a package


81
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:35,546
based file format.


82
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,226
This means that a Playground


83
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:40,236
book is itself a file hierarchy.


84
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,156
It contains a subdirectory for


85
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:45,416
each chapter and nested within


86
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,236
each chapter is a folder for


87
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:48,796
each page in that chapter.


88
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:51,766
And each Playground page folder


89
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,226
contains all of the resources


90
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:54,606
that are required to run the


91
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:56,326
code in the source editor and to


92
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:57,846
display the live view for that


93
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:58,356
page.


94
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,836
Each level in the Playground


95
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:05,466
book hierarchy also contains a


96
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,376
property list file for metadata


97
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,496
that Swift Playground uses to


98
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,536
configure the structure of the


99
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:12,196
book and to construct the table


100
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:12,946
of contents.


101
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,286
And finally, in addition to the


102
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:17,676
content that is shown to your


103
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:19,636
learner in a page, Playground


104
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:21,076
books may contain additional


105
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,816
Swift files called auxiliary


106
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:23,356
sources.


107
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,416
And these are stored in folders


108
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,446
names Sources.


109
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:29,856
Auxiliary sources allow you to


110
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:31,566
provide additional Swift code


111
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,646
like classes or helper functions


112
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:34,866
that can be used throughout the


113
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,906
pages in your Playground book.


114
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,706
You can use auxiliary source


115
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,406
files to achieve many different


116
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:41,916
tasks.


117
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:43,916
And by utilizing these sources,


118
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:45,476
you can greatly simplify the


119
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,746
code that you need to write in


120
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:49,906
each page in your book.


121
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,616
Let's look at an example of


122
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:53,016
using auxiliary sources to


123
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,556
simplify communicating with the


124
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:55,186
live view.


125
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:59,766
You can send values to the live


126
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,736
view by calling the send method


127
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,206
from the Playground Live View


128
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:04,956
Message Handler protocol, which


129
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,176
is declared in the Playground


130
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:07,086
Support framework.


131
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:10,536
Messages are sent to the live


132
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:12,056
view as Playground Values.


133
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,316
Playground Value is an enum that


134
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:15,476
is also declared in the


135
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,716
Playground Support framework.


136
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,826
To simplify converting objects


137
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,596
to Playground values I wrote a


138
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,536
protocol called


139
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,336
PlaygroundValueConvertible in a


140
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:26,056
file called


141
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,536
LiveViewSupport.swift.


142
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,406
And I include this file in the


143
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:31,086
book-level sources folder of


144
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,446
every Playground book that I


145
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:32,756
write.


146
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,376
Then for any type that I want to


147
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,526
send to the live view, like a CI


148
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:38,706
filter for example.


149
00:04:38,706 --> 00:04:40,376
I can extend that type to


150
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:41,126
conform to


151
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:42,846
PlaygroundValueConvertible and


152
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:44,916
implement the asPlaygroundValue


153
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:45,436
method.


154
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,096
This method will convert the


155
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:48,566
original object to a


156
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:49,326
PlaygroundValue.


157
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:52,796
I also wrote a helper function


158
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,836
called sendValue, which takes in


159
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,646
a PlaygroundValueConvertible and


160
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,046
sends it to the current pages


161
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:00,106
live view as a PlaygroundValue.


162
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,426
And finally, when I have an


163
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,526
object in a playground page that


164
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:06,776
I want to send over to the live


165
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:08,536
view, I can simply call


166
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:10,356
sendValue and send in that


167
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:12,416
object as the argument from a


168
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,666
hidden-code block in that


169
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,376
pagescontents.swift.


170
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,886
So as you can see the code that


171
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:19,556
I wrote in my auxiliary source


172
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:21,576
file greatly simplified the code


173
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,036
that I needed to write in my


174
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,546
Playground page for sending a


175
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:26,000
value over to the live view.


176
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:29,996
For more information on the


177
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,466
Playground book package, I


178
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:32,976
recommend you take a look at the


179
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:33,966
Playground Book Format


180
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,256
Reference, which you can find on


181
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:38,486
developer.apple.com.


182
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:40,306
Now, let's take a look at the


183
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,326
Swift Playgrounds Author


184
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:42,896
Template, which you can use to


185
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,076
get started authoring your


186
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,556
Playground books.


187
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,226
The Swift Playgrounds Author


188
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:50,096
Template is a starter Xcode


189
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,476
project that will help you


190
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,016
create, debug, and produce a


191
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:54,756
Playground book.


192
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:57,426
Using the template you can step


193
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:58,726
through the code for your live


194
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,756
view as if it were an app so


195
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,316
that you can identify bugs more


196
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:04,086
easily and develop an efficient


197
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,746
workflow for developing your


198
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:06,566
Playground books.


199
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:08,546
Here you can see me stepping


200
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:09,706
through the code for the live


201
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:11,646
view of the CI filter Playground


202
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:12,986
book that I showed your earlier.


203
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:16,416
The Swift Playgrounds Author


204
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,906
Template is available for you to


205
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:18,576
download from


206
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:22,426
developer.apple.com.


207
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,736
This Xcode project is compatible


208
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,776
with Swift Playgrounds 2.1 and


209
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:29,506
Xcode 9.3, both released earlier


210
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:29,996
this year.


211
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:32,286
This project includes some


212
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:33,686
frameworks that were built using


213
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,706
the Swift 4.1 Compiler since


214
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:36,956
this is what Swift Playgrounds


215
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:38,576
2.1 currently uses.


216
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,296
So it's really important that


217
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:41,636
the version of Xcode that you


218
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,836
use for this project also uses


219
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:45,406
Swift 4.1.


220
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,416
The Swift Playgrounds Author


221
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,966
Template includes three


222
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,296
different targets whose products


223
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:52,736
will help you author your


224
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:53,336
Playground books.


225
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:55,186
The first target is called


226
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:55,816
Playground Book.


227
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,566
The second is called Book


228
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:58,266
Sources.


229
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,156
And the third is called Live


230
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:01,486
View Test App.


231
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:04,246
The Playground Book Target


232
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:05,686
produces a Playground book as


233
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:06,346
its output.


234
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:07,976
And you can see this in the


235
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,536
products group in the Xcode


236
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:10,566
Project Navigator.


237
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:12,996
All of the files for this target


238
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,336
are in the PlaygroundBook group


239
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:15,186
in Xcode.


240
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:16,996
And the template contains the


241
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:18,386
starter files for a playground


242
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,276
book with one chapter and one


243
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:20,866
page.


244
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,336
The template also includes two


245
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:25,796
book level auxiliary source


246
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:27,456
files that provide a default


247
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:29,346
implementation of the always on


248
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:30,656
live view for the Playground


249
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:30,906
book.


250
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:34,656
Next, the Book Sources target


251
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:36,256
compiles all of the book-level


252
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,376
auxiliary sources.


253
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,186
And you can see all of the files


254
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:41,086
for this target in the sources


255
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,146
group inside of the


256
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:43,266
PlaygroundBook group in the


257
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,726
Xcode Project Navigator.


258
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,906
Compiling these sources allows


259
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,466
you to develop your book-level


260
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,146
sources with full editor


261
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:51,946
integration.


262
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,646
This means that you'll be able


263
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:55,186
to use all of the Xcode source


264
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,936
editor features available in any


265
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:58,726
other Xcode project like code


266
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:00,896
completion or quick help.


267
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,986
And finally, the LiveViewTestApp


268
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:05,056
uses this target for displaying


269
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:05,876
the live view.


270
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:07,486
So you're implementation for the


271
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,186
live view of your book must be


272
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:10,646
in your book-level sources if


273
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:13,926
you want to use the test app for


274
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:14,416
debugging.


275
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,496
Lastly, we have the


276
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,906
LiveViewTestApp Target.


277
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:18,806
You can find all of the files


278
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:19,916
for this target in the


279
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,056
LiveViewTestApp group in Xcode.


280
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,426
This target produces an app that


281
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:26,986
displays the live view of your


282
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,776
Playground book similarly to how


283
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,006
it would be shown in Swift


284
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:30,496
Playgrounds.


285
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:33,326
As I mentioned before, the


286
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,556
implementation for your live


287
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,366
view must be in your book level


288
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,385
auxiliary resources.


289
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,446
The LiveViewTestApp allows you


290
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:42,356
to debug your live view in a


291
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,436
full screen or in a side-by-side


292
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,746
mode without first having to


293
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,406
export your Playground book to


294
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:48,116
Swift Playgrounds.


295
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,766
The LiveViewTestApp works on


296
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:53,096
iPad and in the iOS Simulator.


297
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:56,506
The Swift Playgrounds Author


298
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:57,976
Template comes with three


299
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:58,856
supporting frameworks.


300
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:01,096
The first two are the


301
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:02,436
PlaygroundSupport and the


302
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:03,726
PlaygroundBluetooth Frameworks


303
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:04,636
from Swift Playgrounds.


304
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,486
Including these frameworks in


305
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:08,036
the project allows the book


306
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:09,926
sources and the LiveViewTestApp


307
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,506
Targets to take full advantage


308
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:12,766
of the APIs from these


309
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:13,366
frameworks.


310
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,116
And the third supporting frame


311
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:18,116
work is called LiveViewHost.


312
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:19,826
And this framework is used by


313
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,526
LiveViewTestApp for displaying


314
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,000
the live view.


315
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,406
To implement your live view,


316
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,806
you'll need to add all of your


317
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,336
code in the book level auxiliary


318
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,636
sources for your Playground


319
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:32,296
book.


320
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:34,176
Included in the template is a


321
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:35,536
view controller for your live


322
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:36,976
view in a file called


323
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,626
LiveViewController.Swift.


324
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:40,996
Also included in the template is


325
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,406
a helper function for loading an


326
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,376
instance of your live view in a


327
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,016
file called


328
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,446
LiveViewSupport.Swift.


329
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,916
You can add any other files that


330
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,186
you need to implement your live


331
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:52,416
view and you can use any of the


332
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,876
Playgrounds frameworks in your


333
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:54,856
book sources code.


334
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:58,766
Also included in the template is


335
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,046
a storyboard for you to


336
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,626
configure the UI for your live


337
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:01,896
view.


338
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:04,366
You can add any other resources


339
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,686
that your Playground book needs


340
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,276
in the private resources group.


341
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:10,626
And finally, to configure your


342
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,926
live view test for the test app,


343
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:14,546
you'll need to implement a


344
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,446
method in AppDelegate.Swift.


345
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:18,386
Specifically, you'll need to


346
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:19,736
implement the setUpLiveView


347
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,186
method.


348
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:22,936
By default, this method loads an


349
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,566
instance of LiveViewController


350
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,596
from LiveView.storybaord from


351
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:27,536
the helper method that I


352
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:28,266
mentioned in


353
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:29,526
LiveViewSupport.swift.


354
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,346
And this is called


355
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,526
instantiateLiveView.


356
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,396
Now I want to invite Grace back


357
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:36,976
up to the stage and we'll take a


358
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,096
look at the Playground book that


359
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,356
we've been working on using the


360
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,306
Swift Playgrounds Author


361
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:40,726
Template.


362
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:48,746
[ Applause ]


363
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:51,966
OK, so here we're looking at my


364
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,026
Xcode project for the test out


365
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,656
CI filters Playground book that


366
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,796
I showed you a sneak peak of


367
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:57,286
earlier.


368
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,616
And the idea for this book is


369
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:01,376
that a learner can create and


370
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,546
manipulate core image filters in


371
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:04,916
the Source Editor and these


372
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,426
filters will be sent over to the


373
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,556
live view and applied on top of


374
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:09,926
live camera output for them to


375
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,076
see what those filters look


376
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:11,336
like.


377
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:13,956
Here we are looking at the


378
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:15,756
LiveViewController.Swift folder


379
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,566
and I've implemented one of the


380
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:19,846
methods that came in the


381
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,016
template and below that I've


382
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,386
added the rest of the code that


383
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,896
I need to display the live


384
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,856
camera output in the live view.


385
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:29,436
As I mentioned, I also want to


386
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:31,766
apply core image filters on top


387
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,366
of each frame of the live camera


388
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,396
output, so I've added a few more


389
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,376
files in my book level sources


390
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:38,946
and implemented a filter


391
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,226
renderer for applying this


392
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:42,126
filter on top of the live camera


393
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:42,546
output.


394
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:45,226
So now if I select the


395
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,966
LiveViewTestApp Target, I can


396
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,776
actually run this code and see


397
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,116
what my live view will look


398
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:52,366
like.


399
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,986
And I've configured this app to


400
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:56,296
show the live view in a


401
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:57,356
side-by-side mode.


402
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,396
So where we can see what the


403
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:02,366
live view will look like in a


404
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,866
side-by-side mode similarly to


405
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:05,076
how it would be shown next to


406
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,476
the Source Code Editor in Swift


407
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:06,986
Playgrounds.


408
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:08,776
And to simulate sending filters


409
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,276
over to the live view, I've


410
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:11,906
added a couple of buttons, which


411
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:13,096
you see here on the left.


412
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,736
And these are implemented in my


413
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:15,626
test app code.


414
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,466
So now if Grace taps on one of


415
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,566
the filters, we should see that


416
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,716
filter applied to the live


417
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:21,446
camera output.


418
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,216
So this looks great.


419
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,826
I want to try out some of the


420
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,966
other filters, so Grace I really


421
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:28,926
like the CIPointillize filter.


422
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:32,576
So if she taps on that this


423
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,866
looks pretty close but if you


424
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:37,836
can -- if you notice the pink


425
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,536
filter from before is still


426
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,946
around some of the edges and the


427
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:43,116
pointillize filter is a little


428
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,146
smaller than we want.


429
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:45,536
So I'm going to head back over


430
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:47,256
to Xcode because I think we have


431
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:49,236
a bug in my filter renderer that


432
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,286
I wrote in a function called


433
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:51,716
Render.


434
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:53,136
So I'm going to navigate to that


435
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:54,646
function using Open Quickly with


436
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:55,616
Command Shift O.


437
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:58,356
And I'm going to set a


438
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:00,256
breakpoint right before this


439
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:01,136
method returns.


440
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,426
And since each frame of the live


441
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:04,926
camera output is getting a


442
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,536
filter applied on top of it, we


443
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,806
should hit this breakpoint right


444
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:09,026
away because this method is


445
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:09,956
constantly called.


446
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:12,616
OK great. So we've hit the break


447
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:15,106
point and now I can inspect any


448
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,466
of my variables here using the


449
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:17,346
debug console.


450
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:19,456
So specifically I want too look


451
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,766
at the size of the source image


452
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:26,166
and the size of the filtered


453
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,976
image and see how those differ.


454
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,096
OK, so as we can see the size of


455
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,796
the filtered image is larger


456
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:36,816
than the size of the source


457
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,306
image.


458
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:40,066
And on line 59 I'm rendering the


459
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,826
filtered image to the size of


460
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,396
the filtered image, but really


461
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:45,676
what I wanted was the size of


462
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:46,436
the source image.


463
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,576
So I'm going to fix that.


464
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,636
Disable the breakpoint and run


465
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:52,976
it again.


466
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,406
Let's head back over to the


467
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:54,806
iPad.


468
00:13:58,196 --> 00:13:59,706
And let's have Grace take the


469
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,986
same steps as before.


470
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,146
So let's tap on CIColorMatrix


471
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,276
and then tap on CIPointillize


472
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:07,676
and we see that the Pointillize


473
00:14:07,676 --> 00:14:10,126
filter is the correct size, it's


474
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:11,986
the same size as the original


475
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:14,926
live camera output, so now I


476
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:16,366
think all of my code is correct


477
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:18,256
so I actually want to package up


478
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:19,496
my Playground group, copy it


479
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:21,396
over to Playgrounds and see what


480
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:23,006
this live view actually looks


481
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:23,226
like.


482
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:24,716
So if I head back over to Xcode


483
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,036
and select the Playground Book


484
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:30,186
Scheme, I can press Build, and


485
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:32,136
then in the Project Navigator my


486
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,266
Playground Book is under the


487
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:34,366
Build Products Group.


488
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:36,246
So at this point, you'll want to


489
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:37,656
copy your Playground Group over


490
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:39,106
to Swift Playgrounds using


491
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:41,126
Airdrop or iCloud, but for the


492
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,466
sake of time I've all ready done


493
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:42,706
that.


494
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:43,966
So if we head back over to the


495
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:46,276
iPad and have Grace open Swift


496
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,706
Playgrounds, we'll see that my


497
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:50,176
test out CI Filter Playground


498
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:51,176
Book is all ready there.


499
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:52,656
So let's have Grace open it up


500
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:53,866
and we'll see what our live view


501
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:54,846
looks like.


502
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,496
So as you can see we have a CI


503
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,466
filter in the Source Editor and


504
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,646
we've manipulated some of the


505
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:03,026
input values for that filter.


506
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:05,306
So if she taps Run My Code, we


507
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,636
should see that filter applied


508
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:07,776
on top of the camera output.


509
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,556
OK, I really like this filter.


510
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:14,886
I love this color.


511
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:17,156
And hey Grace, do you know what


512
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:18,046
we look like here?


513
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:18,656
>> What's that?


514
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,116
>> I think we look like


515
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:20,766
engineers.


516
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:21,476
>> Yes!


517
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:23,956
>> Yes [laughing].


518
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:27,546
[ Applause ]


519
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:29,836
>> So you just saw us using the


520
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:30,796
Swift Playgrounds Author


521
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,886
Template to write and debug the


522
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:34,106
live view for our Playground


523
00:15:34,106 --> 00:15:35,676
book and we hope that these new


524
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,086
workflows will help you be more


525
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:38,086
efficient in authoring your


526
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:38,856
Playground books.


527
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,486
Now I'm going to hand it back


528
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,026
over to Grace and we'll learn


529
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,336
about these Swift Playground


530
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:43,996
Subscription.


531
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:48,626
[ Applause ]


532
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:49,516
>> Awesome.


533
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:50,916
Thank so much, Holly.


534
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,726
So now that we're refreshed on


535
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,056
the Playground Book format and


536
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,036
have learned about the Swift


537
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,336
Playgrounds Author Template,


538
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:58,876
let's take a look at how to take


539
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,226
those documents and put them


540
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,316
into a subscription.


541
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:04,116
So first off what is a


542
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:04,796
subscription?


543
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:06,166
You should think of a


544
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,016
subscription like Podcasts or


545
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:09,316
like a magazine subscription.


546
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,196
So when new content is published


547
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:13,036
by the author, subscribers will


548
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,256
become aware of it.


549
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,516
Subscriptions show up here along


550
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:17,636
side Apple content.


551
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:19,586
When you publish a new document


552
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:21,126
to your subscription, Swift


553
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:22,376
Playgrounds will fetch it and


554
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,666
display it to the user as a


555
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,106
another document to check out.


556
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:28,736
Users can subscribe to your


557
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:30,426
subscription by visiting your


558
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:31,000
website.


559
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,016
Subscriptions live online as a


560
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,696
feed of downloadable content


561
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:39,586
that you publish.


562
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,486
The way that you publish your


563
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:42,446
content will be through


564
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:44,466
publishing JSON files that have


565
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:45,736
all of the data that Swift


566
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:47,486
Playgrounds needs to download


567
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:48,000
your content.


568
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:51,486
In case you haven't used it


569
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,576
before, JSON is a techs-based


570
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,296
document format for storing and


571
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:56,156
exchanging data.


572
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:58,426
The goal is to communicate to


573
00:16:58,426 --> 00:17:00,016
the consumer of the JSON object


574
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:01,826
what value your content should


575
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:02,806
have for each key.


576
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:04,376
So for example in our


577
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:07,076
subscription the key title has


578
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,756
the value, WWDC Photo Filters.


579
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:14,266
The Playground Feed Format is in


580
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:14,915
two parts.


581
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,786
One part to determine some of


582
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,266
the overarching characteristics


583
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,976
of your subscription and then


584
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:21,685
one part the documents to tell


585
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:23,136
us about teach of the documents


586
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:24,116
within your subscription.


587
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,896
So let's take a look at the


588
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,136
Playground feed format that


589
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:29,366
you'll use when creating your


590
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:30,016
subscription.


591
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:34,426
Our first key is Title.


592
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:36,546
This value should be a string,


593
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:38,106
the title of you subscription.


594
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:39,766
Here's what it should look like


595
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,096
in JSON and here's where the


596
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,696
title shows up in your app


597
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:44,276
within your subscription cell


598
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,076
within Swift Playgrounds.


599
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,246
The next key is the name of the


600
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:50,556
publisher, and that's you.


601
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,036
This keys value should also be a


602
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:54,586
string and it will be the name


603
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:55,536
of the publisher of the


604
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:56,156
subscription.


605
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:57,916
It will show on the detailed


606
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,416
view of each of the documents


607
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,000
within your subscription.


608
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:05,076
Next is the feed identifier.


609
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,156
This should be a reverse DNS


610
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,636
string for the domain that's


611
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:09,676
hosting your feed.


612
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:11,326
We'll get to domains later in


613
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:12,976
this session and reverse DNS


614
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:14,406
just means that it will be that


615
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:15,686
website backwards.


616
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:17,706
So for example, if I'm hosting


617
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,216
my feed at developer.apple.com,


618
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,306
my feed identifier would become


619
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,566
.apple.developer.


620
00:18:26,056 --> 00:18:28,036
The next key is contact URL.


621
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,736
And this what will be used to


622
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:33,886
report issues with your feed.


623
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,216
Next is the feed format version.


624
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,036
This will be the version of the


625
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,716
feed format to which your feed


626
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:40,306
conforms.


627
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,276
This feed format that we're


628
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:43,586
talking about right now is


629
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:44,596
Version 1.0.


630
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,526
And once updates are made to the


631
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,756
feed format that you'd like to


632
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:48,586
incorporate with your


633
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,226
subscription, you can update


634
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:51,726
your feed.JSON file with the


635
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:53,166
changes and bump this format


636
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,786
version up within your feed.JSON


637
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:55,136
file.


638
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:56,886
And remember that this is a


639
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,116
string so it should go in


640
00:18:58,116 --> 00:18:58,386
quotes.


641
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,586
And lastly we need our documents


642
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:02,866
key.


643
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:04,466
So this is the beginning of the


644
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,376
second section of the Playground


645
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:06,876
feed format.


646
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:09,186
The value for this key should be


647
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,986
an array of objects that


648
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:12,636
represent your Playground Books


649
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:13,266
within your feed.


650
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:14,956
So next we'll talk about the


651
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:17,966
format of these objects.


652
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:21,646
Documents is an array of objects


653
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,276
that represent documents with


654
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,126
key value pairs.


655
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,306
Let's go through what you need


656
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:28,856
to represent a document and then


657
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:29,686
we'll put it all together.


658
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,956
Title and overviewSubtitle are


659
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:34,436
strings.


660
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,296
They should be the tile and the


661
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,376
subtitle for each of your


662
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,046
documents.


663
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:39,886
And they show up within your


664
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,276
subscription cell and also


665
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:43,896
within Detail Views for each of


666
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:44,586
your documents.


667
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:50,096
Detail subtitle is an optional


668
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,866
string that you can use to


669
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,236
create a different subtitle to


670
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:54,896
be shown in Detail Views like


671
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:55,146
here.


672
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,496
If you don't provide one, we'll


673
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,000
just omit that section.


674
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,396
Description is text that should


675
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:04,826
describe the purpose of your


676
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:05,306
document.


677
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:06,926
And it will also show up within


678
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:07,916
Detail Views and Swift


679
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:08,396
Playgrounds.


680
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,926
contentIdentifier is another


681
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,506
reverse DNS identifier.


682
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:16,516
It must be unique to the book


683
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,496
and it must match the


684
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:19,016
contentIdentifier within your


685
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,756
books manifest.plistfile.


686
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,026
It should start with the feed


687
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:24,346
identifier of the feed that


688
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:25,486
contains this book.


689
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:26,696
So in this example


690
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,486
io.github.WWDCPhotoFilters.


691
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,326
You should host your content at


692
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:33,636
the same place where you host


693
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:34,596
your feed.JSON file.


694
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,376
But if you don't that's OK,


695
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:37,856
you'll just need to include a


696
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:39,546
secure hash of your Zipped


697
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,046
Playground Book as another key.


698
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:42,746
And you can learn about this


699
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:45,000
more in the feed format online.


700
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:47,726
And there's the


701
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:48,526
contentIdentifier.


702
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:52,136
Content version is the way that


703
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:53,466
you can do versioning with your


704
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:53,776
book.


705
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,596
You need to increment this when


706
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,156
you update your book, and it


707
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,506
always must match the content


708
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:01,000
version in your book's manifest.


709
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:04,036
So next is the URL.


710
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,106
This is very important because


711
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:07,356
it tells Swift Playgrounds where


712
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:08,406
to download your book when your


713
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:09,336
book when your user wants to


714
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:09,716
download it.


715
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,376
This should be a link to the


716
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,986
zipped copy of your Playground


717
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:14,000
Book.


718
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,316
The additionalInformation array


719
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,556
allows you to store additional


720
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:21,066
metadata about your document.


721
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,026
And you can store whatever you


722
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:22,506
want here.


723
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:24,706
This is structured as an array


724
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:26,416
of objects with each object


725
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,106
having key and value pairs.


726
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,226
This example name, made for, and


727
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:33,646
value WWDC would show up like


728
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:34,946
this in Swift programs within


729
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:35,586
the detailed view.


730
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:40,126
You'll need to include the


731
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,856
publish date and last updated


732
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:42,956
date of your content.


733
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,436
These dates need to be ISO 8601


734
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,416
formatted and should reflect the


735
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,806
day that you publish this piece


736
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:51,506
of content and the day that you


737
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,796
last updated this piece of


738
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:53,276
content.


739
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:58,586
And lastly, there are three keys


740
00:21:58,586 --> 00:21:59,836
for images used in your


741
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:00,506
subscription.


742
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:02,976
The thumbnail URL would show up


743
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,416
here within Swift Playgrounds,


744
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,206
as well as within the detail


745
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:09,266
view for any of your documents.


746
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:12,376
Preview Image URLs would show up


747
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:14,606
here in the detail view for each


748
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:16,126
of your documents and can show


749
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,366
users a little bit of extra


750
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,586
information about your


751
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:19,086
Playground.


752
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:22,596
And in older versions of Swift


753
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:24,596
Playgrounds, we used this as the


754
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:25,576
banner image URL.


755
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:27,646
So to support users that are


756
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,866
using older versions of Swift


757
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,006
Playgrounds, you'll also need to


758
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:30,846
include this image.


759
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:35,866
So OK, now that we have finished


760
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,766
up with the feed format, let's


761
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:38,636
jump into publishing.


762
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,036
So you might be wondering, how


763
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:42,326
do I publish all of these files


764
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:42,836
that I've made?


765
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:44,556
You'll need to put both your


766
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:46,896
feed.JSON file and all of your


767
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,336
documents that you've written on


768
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:48,606
the web.


769
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:50,506
For this, you'll need a web


770
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:51,586
host.


771
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:54,706
Publishing your subscription


772
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:55,876
requires a web host.


773
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:57,466
There are a number of different


774
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,146
ways that you can do this like


775
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,716
using GitHub pages, using


776
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:03,026
Squarespace, and others, but for


777
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:04,306
today we'll be working with an


778
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,846
example of GitHub pages.


779
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:09,616
GitHub pages is a tool that lets


780
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,256
you create a website for you and


781
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,866
your project and it's hosted


782
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:13,896
directly from a GitHub


783
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:14,586
repository.


784
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,826
It uses Git to manage content.


785
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:19,156
So let's walk through some of


786
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:20,086
the steps that you'll need to


787
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:21,396
take to use GitHub pages.


788
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:24,956
First you will need a GitHub


789
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:25,286
account.


790
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,456
You can create one through


791
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:28,276
GitHub's website.


792
00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:31,376
Next, you'll have to make a


793
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,426
repository called


794
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:34,446
username.github.io.


795
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,436
It must be named in this way or


796
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:37,066
else it won't work.


797
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:38,896
And this will be the repository


798
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:42,616
where you'll store your content.


799
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:43,896
Once you've cloned that


800
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,996
repository to your Mac, you can


801
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:48,236
create an index.html file to


802
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:49,646
serve as the homepage of your


803
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:49,956
website.


804
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:51,966
This one here will just display


805
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:53,156
Hello WWDC.


806
00:23:55,036 --> 00:23:56,546
To learn more about source


807
00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:57,916
control workflows in Xcode,


808
00:23:58,206 --> 00:23:59,316
check out this session from


809
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:01,000
earlier this week.


810
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:05,456
After you've created that file,


811
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:06,486
make sure it's in your


812
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,686
repository, commit your changes,


813
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,056
push, and then visit your


814
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:12,956
website at username.github.io.


815
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,096
As you continue adding more


816
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,166
files and folders to your


817
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,606
repository and continue to


818
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,876
commit and push them up to your


819
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,896
website, it will update your


820
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:22,026
repository and therefore


821
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:22,836
GitHub's website.


822
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,196
So right now the folder only has


823
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:28,996
one file, index.html.


824
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:30,706
This will serve as your landing


825
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:31,706
page for your website.


826
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,546
But as we talked about earlier


827
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:34,736
you'll need a couple more files


828
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,936
to support your subscription.


829
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:38,696
So as Holly mentioned, we have


830
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:39,906
been working on a subscription


831
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:41,816
called WWDC Photo Filters that


832
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:42,896
has some really cool photo


833
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,246
filtering content using Core


834
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:45,486
Image within Swift Playgrounds.


835
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:46,916
I'm going to walk you though the


836
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:48,536
levels of our repository to show


837
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:49,716
how we've organized it as an


838
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:50,156
example.


839
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:54,456
The first file that needs to be


840
00:24:54,456 --> 00:24:56,506
included is your feed.JSON file.


841
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,676
We've put ours in our repository


842
00:24:58,676 --> 00:24:59,856
at the same level as our


843
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:01,376
index.html file.


844
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:05,036
And next you'll need to store


845
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:05,906
all of your documents.


846
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,086
Each playground that we've


847
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:09,616
published is stored in a folder


848
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:11,226
to keep our repository clean.


849
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:13,056
We have a folder for each of our


850
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,016
pieces of content.


851
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:17,566
So ImageTransitions, IntrotoCI


852
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,316
and so on.


853
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,556
So at the top level of our


854
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:22,206
repository we have our


855
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:24,746
index.html file, our feed.JSON


856
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,456
file and a folder for each


857
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:27,000
document.


858
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:30,906
If I open one of the folders for


859
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,746
a document I see four things --


860
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:35,616
a zips.playgroundbook file and


861
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:36,206
three images.


862
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,506
These three images are a banner


863
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:40,846
image, one preview image, and a


864
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:41,716
thumbnail image.


865
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:43,576
The zipped Playground book will


866
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:44,596
be the Playground book that a


867
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:45,256
user downloads.


868
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:48,876
So let's look at how this


869
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:51,076
compares with our feed.JSON


870
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:51,386
file.


871
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:54,316
At the top level we can see that


872
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:55,586
the feed identifier is the


873
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:57,366
reverse DNS of our website,


874
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:01,000
io.github.wwdcPhotoFilters.


875
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,626
In the documents array, there's


876
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:07,996
an element for each of the four


877
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:09,406
documents that we've posted.


878
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:13,586
And if we look at our first


879
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:15,646
document the contentIdentifier


880
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,586
matches the feed identifier and


881
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:19,000
adds the first book's title.


882
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:24,146
For the URL of the book we have


883
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:24,796
our website


884
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:28,926
/IntrotoCI/IntrotoCI.


885
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:30,006
playgroundbook.zip.


886
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,776
And again this is really


887
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,246
important to get right because


888
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:34,266
it's where Swift Playgrounds


889
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,036
will go to download your


890
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:35,486
content.


891
00:26:35,486 --> 00:26:40,526
The URLs of your images can be


892
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:41,466
relative URLs.


893
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,086
So you only need to include the


894
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:44,466
folder underneath where your


895
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,146
feed.JSON file is stored and


896
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:46,686
downwards.


897
00:26:47,126 --> 00:26:48,206
So here I just have


898
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:50,316
IntrotoCI/thumbnail.png.


899
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:52,526
And each of the documents in


900
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:53,916
your subscription should mirror


901
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:56,626
this format.


902
00:26:57,176 --> 00:26:58,146
Once everything is online,


903
00:26:58,496 --> 00:26:59,676
anyone can subscribe to your


904
00:26:59,676 --> 00:27:00,006
feed.


905
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:02,066
They could do it by manually


906
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:03,766
typing in the URL that points to


907
00:27:03,766 --> 00:27:06,846
your feed.JSON file, or you can


908
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:08,366
use universal links so that a


909
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,326
user can tap on a link from


910
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:12,516
within Safari and get redirected


911
00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:13,366
to Swift Playgrounds.


912
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:15,756
To do that you'll need to


913
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:17,556
combine the URL for your feed


914
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,516
and the Universal link prefix


915
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:20,636
for Swift Playgrounds.


916
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,276
So here's the code for the link


917
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,106
in our index.html file.


918
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,156
I've combined the universal link


919
00:27:28,236 --> 00:27:28,886
prefix,


920
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:33,536
https/developer.apple.com/ul/ --


921
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:36,586
you get it [laughs], with our


922
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:38,226
subscription URL.


923
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,446
Then you can imbed that link in


924
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:43,326
an anchor element with an href


925
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:45,046
attribute so users can simply


926
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,136
tap subscribe and be directed to


927
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:48,066
Swift Playgrounds.


928
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:51,566
So next I'd like to demo the


929
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,306
steps that you should take to


930
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:54,616
add a book to your subscription.


931
00:27:55,516 --> 00:28:01,926
[ Applause ]


932
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:03,526
OK, so like I said, we're


933
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:04,766
working on this photo filtering


934
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,916
subscription that I think is


935
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:06,436
really cool.


936
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:08,556
So I've actually just finished


937
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,556
another book about content aware


938
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:11,176
resizing.


939
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:14,076
Content aware resizing is a way


940
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:15,586
that you can resize your images


941
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:16,566
without losing the most


942
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:17,766
important parts of your image.


943
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,706
So I have this photo of Monument


944
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:21,496
Valley that I think is really


945
00:28:21,496 --> 00:28:23,416
beautiful, but I'd really like


946
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:24,816
to trim it a little bit and make


947
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:26,026
the width a little bit smaller.


948
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:28,076
But I don't want to scale it


949
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:29,366
down and I don't want to crop it


950
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,406
because I don't want to miss out


951
00:28:30,406 --> 00:28:31,746
on the beautiful sunset and the


952
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:32,206
monuments.


953
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:36,116
With content aware resizing, I


954
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,066
can take that photo and look


955
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,176
through all of the different


956
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,786
pixels in the photo, find the


957
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:42,586
least important vertical seams,


958
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,436
and remove those one-by-one so


959
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:45,506
that the width gets a little


960
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:47,446
smaller each time, but I still


961
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:48,346
have the really important


962
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:50,696
monuments and the sunset, the


963
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:52,186
road, and everything is still


964
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:52,976
there.


965
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:56,366
So I've written all that code


966
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,496
within a Playground book that


967
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,686
I've called Content Aware


968
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:00,146
Resizing.


969
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:01,756
And it's stored within my


970
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:03,196
Content Aware Resizing folder.


971
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,106
So this is almost done.


972
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,616
All I need to do is zip it up,


973
00:29:09,726 --> 00:29:11,216
so I'm going to select File,


974
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:13,856
CompressContentAwareResizing.


975
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:14,496
PlaygroundBook.


976
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,316
So now I have a zipped file of


977
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:17,506
my Playground book and I'm going


978
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,466
to go ahead and move this to the


979
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:21,236
Trash.


980
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:23,126
And lastly, I'm going to need to


981
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:24,706
move in a couple of images from


982
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:25,816
the thumbnail and the banner


983
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:27,656
image, the two required images


984
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:28,406
within the feed format.


985
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,436
So luckily I have two images on


986
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,866
my desktop called Thumbnail.png


987
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:34,896
and BannerImage.png.


988
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:36,776
Adjust these two.


989
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:37,506
Perfect.


990
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:39,666
So I'll go ahead and drag that


991
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:40,936
into my folder.


992
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,276
So if I look within my WWDC


993
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:47,616
Photo Filters Repository, I have


994
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:50,426
three folders here right now and


995
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:52,276
each of them have an image, a


996
00:29:52,276 --> 00:29:53,866
zipped Playground book, and then


997
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:54,996
another image for the thumbnail.


998
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:56,266
So this looks pretty good.


999
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:58,786
I think my folder mirrors that


1000
00:29:58,836 --> 00:29:59,366
perfectly.


1001
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:01,806
So I'm ready to put it up and


1002
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:02,786
publish it.


1003
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:04,996
So I've created a workspace for


1004
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:05,846
my repository.


1005
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,206
So I'm going to take this folder


1006
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:12,036
and drag it over, put it within


1007
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:14,146
my repository, and now I have


1008
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:14,986
another folder for


1009
00:30:14,986 --> 00:30:16,366
ContentAwareResizing.


1010
00:30:17,406 --> 00:30:18,676
Double check that everything is


1011
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:20,536
still there and it looks good.


1012
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,986
So the last step that we'll need


1013
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:24,516
to take is to update our


1014
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:25,646
feed.JSON file.


1015
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:29,046
So here's that file and you can


1016
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:30,856
see in My Documents array I have


1017
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:33,076
my Image Transitions object, my


1018
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:34,926
Intro to Core Image object, and


1019
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:36,726
my Test Out CI Filters Object.


1020
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:38,796
So I need to add one more object


1021
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,076
for ContentAwareResizing.


1022
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:43,946
And luckily I've made a snippet


1023
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:47,626
for it and here we go.


1024
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:48,796
So I've all ready filled most of


1025
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:50,396
this out because of my nails


1026
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,646
[laughs], so all I need to do is


1027
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:54,676
type in the title and I'm going


1028
00:30:55,696 --> 00:30:57,456
to call this


1029
00:30:58,236 --> 00:30:59,186
ContentAwareResizing.


1030
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,246
I've decided to omit the


1031
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:03,736
detailed subtitle and I just


1032
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,506
have my overview subtitle try


1033
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:06,886
out ContentAwareResizing with


1034
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:07,236
Swift.


1035
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:09,976
I have a description and my


1036
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,266
content identifier is


1037
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:13,856
io.github.wwdcphotofilters.


1038
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:15,866
ContentAwareResizing, the title


1039
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:16,226
of my book.


1040
00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:17,576
It's the first time I'm


1041
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:18,996
publishing it so my content


1042
00:31:18,996 --> 00:31:20,006
version is 1.0.


1043
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,836
And my URL maps to my website


1044
00:31:22,836 --> 00:31:25,076
and then I have my folder name,


1045
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,136
ContentAwareResizing --


1046
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:28,366
/ContentAwareResizing.


1047
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,566
PlaygroundBook.zip.


1048
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,636
My publish date is right now at


1049
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:34,506
9:40 [laughs].


1050
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:37,056
And my last updated date is also


1051
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:39,036
at 9:40 since publishing it


1052
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:39,716
counts as an update.


1053
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:42,526
I've also included my thumbnail


1054
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,186
URL and my Banner Image URL.


1055
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:46,276
For additional information I


1056
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:48,066
have English as a language.


1057
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:50,796
And my Preview Image URLs I've


1058
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:53,426
decided to leave blank for now.


1059
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,186
All right, so this all looks


1060
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:58,556
good and now all I need to do is


1061
00:31:58,556 --> 00:31:59,936
going to Xcode Source Control,


1062
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,246
Commit, make sure all four of


1063
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:04,436
these files are selected.


1064
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:06,526
So I've added three files and I


1065
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:07,876
modified feed.JSON.


1066
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:10,046
I'm going to commit and say


1067

And, great.


1072
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:26,616
It worked.


1073
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:26,996

So awesome, we have our website

nice subscribe button.

One is Image Transitions, using

the built in transition filters


1099

within Core Image.


1100
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:36,196
One is Combining Filters within

Cool, it worked.


1119
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:11,406
So, in the live view on the


1120
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:13,005
right I have this beautiful


1121
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,795
picture of Monument Valley and


1122
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:15,926
I'm going to have Holly crop it


1123
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:17,005
a little bit and then run the


1124
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,386
code and we'll see what it


1125
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:19,000
produces.


1126
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:26,866
So what this algorithm does is


1127
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,735
it looks at all of the vertical


1128
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:31,166
seams in an image, decides which


1129
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:33,676
of the seams are least different


1130
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:34,646
from the ones around it and


1131
00:34:34,646 --> 00:34:35,766
removes those one by one.


1132
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:37,516
So now we can see it's a little


1133
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:39,275
bit cropped and it looks


1134
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:40,000
