[ Applause ]


3
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:20,356
>> Good morning.


4
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,426
Who here has an app on the store


5
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:25,936
that uses Apple Pencil?


6
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:28,936
All right, a few of you.


7
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,646
And who has an app on the store


8
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:32,916
with Apple Pencil features that


9
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,736
is not a drawing or a painting


10
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:36,136
app?


11
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,276
Oh, one, yes.


12
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,516
Well, today, not only are we


13
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:40,616
going to learn a few things


14
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:42,676
about how to make your app great


15
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,156
with Pencil, we're also going to


16
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:46,056
see that Pencil can be for so


17
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:47,586
much more than just drawing.


18
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,906
Pencil can do a lot of things


19
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:53,896
and it can be a bit daunting to


20
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:55,076
add Pencil interactions to your


21
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:56,596
app, especially if you've never


22
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:57,456
worked with it before.


23
00:00:58,376 --> 00:00:59,666
Today, we're going to look at


24
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:02,676
seven properties of Pencil that,


25
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,316
when implemented, will add


26
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:06,006
entire new dimensions to your


27
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:06,326
app.


28
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:08,426
And to do that, we're going to


29
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:10,056
add Pencil interactions to an


30
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:11,306
existing app.


31
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:12,896
So, here's my app.


32
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:14,296
It's a fairly straightforward


33
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:15,036
sudoku game.


34
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:16,586
The puzzle screen shows the


35
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:17,756
current puzzle we're solving.


36
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:19,716
Tapping a cell brings up the


37
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,306
keyboard where the player can


38
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:22,686
enter a number, and there are a


39
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,266
number of buttons for showing or


40
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,566
hiding the timer, depending on


41
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:27,406
how competitive you are, for


42
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:29,806
getting a hint, and for changing


43
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:30,746
various settings about the


44
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:31,306
current game.


45
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:33,736
So, even though this is not a


46
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:35,416
drawing app, doesn't it seem


47
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,376
perfect for Pencil?


48
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:37,806
Let's make it happen.


49
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:41,896
And the first thing we're going


50
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:43,946
to look at is that Pencil makes


51
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:44,506
marks.


52
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:46,976
I don't know about you, but if I


53
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,046
pick up a pen and I try to write


54
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:50,396
with it and it doesn't write, I


55
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:51,346
toss it out.


56
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,526
We worked really hard on Apple


57
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:55,186
Pencil and we don't want people


58
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:56,386
tossing out their Apple Pencil.


59
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,696
So, don't require tapping a


60
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:02,106
button or entering a special


61
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,056
mode to draw with Pencil.


62
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,706
Pencil should make a mark the


63
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:09,925
moment it touches the screen.


64
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:13,766
When I put Pencil down, I can go


65
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,086
ahead and write my guess


66
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:15,876
immediately.


67
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:21,456
Pencil is familiar; it should


68
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,116
behave consistently with what


69
00:02:23,116 --> 00:02:24,396
people using our app have come


70
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:25,546
to expect.


71
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:28,246
This means that tapping controls


72
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,156
should behave the same whether


73
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:30,376
you touch them with Pencil or


74
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,216
your finger.


75
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:32,816
Here, I can interact with the


76
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,846
various setting sliders using


77
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,446
Pencil just like I would with my


78
00:02:36,446 --> 00:02:37,126
finger.


79
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,156
One thing we definitely never


80
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,006
want to do is have controls that


81
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:41,676
will have different


82
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:43,496
consequences, or worse, do


83
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,326
nothing when tapped with Pencil


84
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:46,336
rather than a finger.


85
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,406
This would be very unpredictable


86
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,276
and confusing.


87
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:53,996
Pencil has a number of sensors.


88
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,726
It can sense tilt, force, and


89
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,736
orientation, and these sensors


90
00:02:58,736 --> 00:02:59,826
can add layers of depth and


91
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,126
expressivity to our


92
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:02,646
interactions, but there are a


93
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:03,666
few missteps to avoid.


94
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:06,436
A good way to use the sensors is


95
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,786
to make marks more expressive.


96
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,326
For example, the continuous


97
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:10,756
variation of pressure and tilt


98
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:12,356
can modulate the thickness of a


99
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:12,796
stroke.


100
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,436
Or the orientation to affect the


101
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:16,556
width of a marker.


102
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:19,886
We don't want to use sensors to


103
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,086
affect things not directly


104
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:22,176
related to Pencil input.


105
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:24,096
For example, here, depending on


106
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,726
how hard we press, we get a new


107
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,226
puzzle of varying difficulty.


108
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:28,676
That's just a confusing


109
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,516
behavior.


110
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:31,246
Sensors should affect the kind


111
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,546
of marks that Pencil makes, not


112
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,676
things disconnected from it.


113
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:39,356
Another way to handle sensor


114
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:40,606
data is discretely.


115
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:41,816
For instance, to modify the


116
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:42,936
input based on the pressure


117
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:43,366
exerted.


118
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,576
So, an idea for a game here is


119
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,416
to let people pencil in a


120
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,416
tentative guess, depending on


121
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,166
how hard they write.


122
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:51,876
Writing lightly lets you put in


123
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,466
a guess in lighter ink, and


124
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,096
writing with more pressure lets


125
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:56,656
you commit that answer in black


126
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:56,896
ink.


127
00:03:57,476 --> 00:04:00,746
We can think about a sensor


128
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,536
reading such as pressor as a


129
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:04,606
continuum and treat it as such


130
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,526
to modulate a quality of a mark.


131
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:09,646
We can also split that continuum


132
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:11,246
binarily, as we just did for


133
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:12,326
this pencil-in feature.


134
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,206
In this case, we'll want to make


135
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:15,866
sure to give clear feedback as


136
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,096
to which side of the split we're


137
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:17,296
on.


138
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,685
We definitely don't want to


139
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,026
break that continuum into more


140
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:23,586
than two discrete parts though,


141
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,236
as it would become very hard to


142
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:26,176
differentiate.


143
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,816
People can tell the difference


144
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,326
between writing soft or writing


145
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:30,886
hard, but they can't tell the


146
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:33,096
difference between 5 or 8 or 15


147
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:34,146
different levels of pressure.


148
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,486
Handwriting is tremendously


149
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:42,106
expressive, and as a result, so


150
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:43,216
is Pencil input.


151
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,626
As we get our game for people to


152
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:47,966
try, we notice that people will


153
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,276
often write slightly outside of


154
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,376
the boundaries of a cell and


155
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:52,536
this is a totally normal side


156
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:54,406
effect of handwriting being so


157
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:56,226
personal and freeform, but it


158
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:57,466
means we need to be flexible


159
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,186
with how we handle input.


160
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:01,666
What we shouldn't do is impose


161
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,096
unnecessary constraints on


162
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,786
input, like rejecting it if it


163
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:06,136
doesn't fit perfectly within the


164
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:06,446
cell.


165
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,826
So, what we're going to do here


166
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,736
is assign the answer to the cell


167
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,736
it covers the most and we also


168
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:14,576
scale and move it to make it fit


169
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:15,926
neatly into the cell, which is a


170
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:16,596
nice little touch.


171
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,986
Now, an interesting question


172
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:21,666
comes up.


173
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,736
What should we do if the player


174
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:25,236
starts drawing or writing


175
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:27,066
outside of the main sudoku grid?


176
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:29,586
One thing we can try doing is


177
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,716
just nothing, but it doesn't


178
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:32,576
feel very good.


179
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,026
It goes back to our earlier


180
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,736
point about making a mark.


181
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,626
It breaks the impression of


182
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,266
fluidity and it might even lead


183
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,616
some people to think that their


184
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,036
Pencil is impaired, or the


185
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:43,016
battery is discharged.


186
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:46,816
Something we can try is to show


187
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:48,766
transient marks, marks that


188
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,516
disappear shortly after they've


189
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,426
been made, to communicate that


190
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:53,956
everything is working fine, just


191
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:55,376
the margins don't do anything


192
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:55,796
special.


193
00:05:58,016 --> 00:05:59,776
Another option we can try is to


194
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,876
just let people draw and


195
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:02,456
annotate in the margins just for


196
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:02,826
fun.


197
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:04,446
And this could be particularly


198
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:05,806
great if later we add


199
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:06,956
multiplayer to our game.


200
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:09,616
Now, there is no right or wrong


201
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:10,236
answer here.


202
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,336
It is up to you and what you


203
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,326
want your app to be; but doing


204
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:15,866
something is always better than


205
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,546
doing nothing, even if that


206
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,016
something is just to communicate


207
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,336
that Pencil is working.


208
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,666
If you're not drawing with


209
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,266
Pencil, you're writing.


210
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,566
And because you're writing on an


211
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,226
iPad and not a piece of paper,


212
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:31,836
we have to ask ourselves


213
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,176
questions about whether we want


214
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,776
to process the input further.


215
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:37,666
For the case of our game, should


216
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:38,726
we convert handwriting to


217
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:42,356
digital or should we keep it


218
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:44,896
analog as it is?


219
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,766
One reason to convert it to


220
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,646
digital is to be consistent with


221
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:49,406
keyboard input.


222
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:51,716
And one reason to keep it analog


223
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,216
is that it's fun and personal.


224
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:55,786
Again, here there are no right


225
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:56,636
or wrong answers.


226
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:58,226
It will depend on your specific


227
00:06:58,226 --> 00:06:58,996
circumstances.


228
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:00,486
You do want to keep it


229
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,046
consistent so that people using


230
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,326
your app know what to expect.


231
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,746
And if we do choose to keep the


232
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,676
input analog, it's always a good


233
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,176
idea to digitize it under the


234
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:10,736
hood to enable things like


235
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,786
searching for text or, in the


236
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:14,096
case of our game, so that we can


237
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,846
validate the final answer to the


238
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:20,856
puzzle the player came up with.


239
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,346
So far, we've been talking a lot


240
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,136
about Pencil and it can be easy


241
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:25,336
to forget that there is a human


242
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:26,056
holding it.


243
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,636
Different people will hold and


244
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,696
use Pencil differently.


245
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,446
For example, if I watch a


246
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:33,986
left-handed person use our game,


247
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,066
we'll notice that their hand and


248
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,106
arm gets in the way of the


249
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,276
controls on the left side of the


250
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:38,666
screen.


251
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:40,596
The positioning of these


252
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:41,966
controls wasn't much of an issue


253
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:43,526
when our app was used primarily


254
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:45,556
with touch, but it becomes an


255
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:46,296
issue with Pencil.


256
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,876
So, what we can do is move the


257
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,616
control to the top or bottom of


258
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:54,466
the screen or just make them


259
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:55,156
repositionable.


260
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,546
And, finally, Pencil is really


261
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:04,636
great when it provides


262
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:05,366
shortcuts.


263
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,076
That is, letting people do


264
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:08,796
things faster by drawing and


265
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:10,326
writing rather than tapping on


266
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:10,766
the screen.


267
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:13,686
So, how do we erase a cell in


268
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:14,096
our game?


269
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,226
It's a two-step process.


270
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,896
The first step is we tap the


271
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,936
cell we want to erase, and the


272
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,346
second step is we press the


273
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:23,056
backspace key.


274
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:25,476
So, can we turn this two-step


275
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,316
interaction into a one-step


276
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:28,576
interaction with Pencil?


277
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,176
Something that would feel pretty


278
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,765
natural is letting people cross


279
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:35,006
out their answer, so let's give


280
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:35,556
that a try.


281
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,135
Seems to work pretty well.


282
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,516
But, as I give my game for


283
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:46,076
people to try, I notice


284
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:46,976
something interesting when they


285
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,606
try to erase a cell.


286
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:52,456
Some people will strike it


287
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:56,306
through, others will scribble it


288
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:03,546
over, and yet others might draw


289
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,686
something like an X mark.


290
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:08,616
Handwriting is really


291
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,406
expressive; different people


292
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,246
will cross things out


293
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:11,756
differently.


294
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:13,816
So, in this case, it's probably


295
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:14,646
better not to ask people to


296
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:15,556
perform a specific mark they


297
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,366
would have to remember.


298
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,786
In addition to being hard to


299
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:20,116
remember, specific marks might


300
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,166
have different meanings in


301
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:21,926
different cultures.


302
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,006
For example, in the U.S., it's


303
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:25,296
pretty common to use a checkmark


304
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:25,926
to mean correct.


305
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:27,776
In other countries, that might


306
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,756
not mean anything or even mean


307
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:30,226
incorrect.


308
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:34,086
So, what we do is we just let


309
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:35,456
people erase a cell by


310
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,796
scribbling over it.


311
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:39,436
Whether they slash it out, draw


312
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:42,056
an X, scribble over it, draw a


313
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:43,606
straight line, it doesn't


314
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:43,986
matter.


315
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:45,436
All of it works and erases the


316
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:45,726
cell.


317
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:48,946
Let's look at another two-step


318
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,596
interaction, getting a hint.


319
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,336
First, we'd have to tap the hint


320
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,306
button and then we tap the cell


321
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,136
we want a hint for.


322
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,176
And this is another interaction


323
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,446
that we can bring down to one


324
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:01,666
step using Pencil.


325
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,166
Perhaps we can let the player


326
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,876
draw a question mark on the cell


327
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:07,976
they want an answer to.


328
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:09,216
And this feels pretty good.


329
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:12,206
And in this case, because the


330
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:13,756
question mark is mirrored in the


331
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,786
icon of our hint button, I feel


332
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,126
pretty good about using that


333
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:22,186
mark as a shortcut for hint.


334
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:23,706
Now, these seven properties are


335
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,726
by no means an exhaustive list


336
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,316
of all the ways Pencil can make


337
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:29,036
your app great, but I hope


338
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:30,006
they've shown you a side of


339
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,366
Pencil that perhaps you did not


340
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,366
expect and I hope they help you


341
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,056
start thinking about what adding


342
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:36,376
Pencil interactions would mean


343
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:37,316
for your app.


344
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:38,456
Thank you.
