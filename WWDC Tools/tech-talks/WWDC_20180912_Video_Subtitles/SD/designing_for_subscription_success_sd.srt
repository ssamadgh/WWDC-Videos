00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,835
Hi, my name is Lauren Strehlow.


2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,203
I'm a design evangelist,


3
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,671
and we're going
to be talking about


4
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,608
designing
for subscription success.


5
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,943
Subscriptions are the fastest
growing business model


6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,578
on the App Store.


7
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,180
But why is it almost every time


8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,450
you're ready to sign up
for some awesome new service,


9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,187
or subscribe to some new,
exciting content,


10
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,522
this is the feeling
that you get?


11
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,025
That’s because
it's all too common


12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,363
for subscriptions to feel
complicated, confusing,


13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,698
and just&nbsp;take too long
to sign up.


14
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:36,470
So for a great user experience,
make your subscription


15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,274
effortless, transparent,
and engaging.


16
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,777
In other words,
make it easy to subscribe.


17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,514
Let's focus on each
of these principles


18
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,150
to improve the user experience
and design


19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,819
for subscription success.


20
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,757
What does it mean for your
subscription to be effortless?


21
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,293
First, it means people
should know


22
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,994
that you have
a subscription.


23
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,263
They shouldn't have to look
for how to sign up.


24
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,467
So be visible, get out there,
and don’t be shy!


25
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,569
Let people know that you have
a subscription


26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,005
and ask them to sign up.


27
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,342
One approach would be to persist
a subscribe button


28
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,177
in you app’s interface.


29
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,113
So here,
in the New York Times app,


30
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,983
they persist -- tastefully --
a subscribe button


31
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:26,153
that is visible across
all of their articles,


32
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,622
and this is done really well.


33
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,358
It's not annoying or pushy
because it families together


34
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,327
with their interface.


35
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,928
Don't present your subscription


36
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,431
like an a pop-up ad
or notification,


37
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:41,468
because ads and notifications
are intended to be dismissed,


38
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,105
and you don't want people
to dismiss your subscription.


39
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,442
Another way to be visible would
be to present your subscription


40
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:53,046
when a person has shown interest
in a feature or piece of content


41
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,616
that you offer
through your subscription.


42
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,920
This is the dating&nbsp;app, HER,
and as a category,


43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,055
dating apps have been
in the subscription business


44
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,525
for a long time
and they do it really well.


45
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,562
So let's just say you are
swiping through a few profiles


46
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,832
and accidentally pass on someone
who is cute,


47
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,502
so at that moment
you attempt to rewind.


48
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,539
Well, the app HER tastefully
presents an option to subscribe,


49
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,543
because the rewind feature
is a part of their subscription.


50
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,313
It's an appropriate time
to present this offer


51
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,382
because you've shown interest.


52
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,417
And HER does a great job


53
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,020
presenting the values
of their subscription offer


54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,290
right here with this beautiful,
light animation.


55
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,960
So make it easy
for people to sign up,


56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,596
make sure they know you have
a subscription.


57
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:46,266
Be visible, so you can&nbsp;choose
to present your subscription


58
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,468
when a person has
expressed interest


59
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:52,506
or tastefully persist
an option to subscribe.


60
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,474
But no matter which option
you choose,


61
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,610
all subscription apps
should include a way


62
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,846
to sign up from Settings
or Account from within the app,


63
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,649
because that's an intuitive
place where people would go


64
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,018
to look to sign up.


65
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,654
Also, to make your subscription
effortless,


66
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,790
you need to remove friction.


67
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,692
Friction is asking
for too much effort


68
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,961
by asking for
too much information


69
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,465
and requiring too many steps
to sign up.


70
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,868
But how do you know
when you've asked for too much?


71
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,438
Well, this data should help.


72
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,808
This graph represents a snapshot
of one month of data


73
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:32,646
from the top three entertainment
video streaming apps in the U.S.


74
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,514
While their names
have been removed,


75
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:39,619
the important data here is
the clicks to conversion ratio.


76
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,955
A subscription flow
with three clicks


77
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,092
led to a 61 percent
conversion rate,


78
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,394
and a subscription flow
with four clicks


79
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,297
led to a 48 percent
conversion rate.


80
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,265
However, nine clicks...


81
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:56,336
the conversation rate drops
significantly to seven percent.


82
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,605
Now, while this is
just a sample,


83
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,407
it's clear that you should
only ask


84
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,709
for what is absolutely necessary


85
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,613
because quite literally,
less is more.


86
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,116
Less clicks,
less friction,


87
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,552
will equal more conversion
and more subscribers.


88
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,188
Focus people
on singing up first.


89
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,656
Personalization,
favoriting,


90
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,826
and requesting additional
personal details


91
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,597
can all wait until after someone
has signed up.


92
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,932
By being visible
and removing friction,


93
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,101
your app’s subscription
will be effortless


94
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,239
and easier for people
to subscribe.


95
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,407
Next, let's talk about
your subscription


96
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,209
being transparent


97
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,179
because transparency
is the best policy,


98
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,981
and you need
to provide clear terms,


99
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,351
so people understand
what they are signing up for.


100
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,086
Strive to be glanceable;


101
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,855
in one view
and in just a few seconds,


102
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,891
people should be able
to clearly understand


103
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:54,561
what your subscription offer is
and how to sign up.


104
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,463
When making
your subscription offer,


105
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:01,301
always include a concise
value proposition,


106
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,371
a strong call to action,


107
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,241
a place to login
for existing subscribers,


108
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,310
the ability to restore
a purchase


109
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,746
if someone has a new device,


110
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,215
and a place to sign up
that includes


111
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,484
clear terms and pricing,


112
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,419
and always offer multiple tiers,


113
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,189
because somebody may want
to sign up for a day,


114
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,058
a week, a month, or two years,


115
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,361
so try offering three or four
different subscription tiers


116
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,965
to figure out what works best
for your audience.


117
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,067
And be sure to follow
App Review guidelines


118
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,036
to ensure that your
subscription offer


119
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,904
is within policy.


120
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,473
People have to have the ability
to easily see


121
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,044
terms and conditions
when they're asked to subscribe.


122
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,947
The MLB At Bat app does
a great job


123
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,684
and offers all of this
in one easy-to-understand,


124
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,285
glanceable&nbsp;view.


125
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,720
And all of this is important


126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,023
because most of us
are signing up on our phones.


127
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,826
So please,
keep it simple.


128
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,495
By providing clear terms,
people will be able to make


129
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,999
an informed decision
to subscribe.


130
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,568
All right,
I saved the best for last.


131
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,805
Your app needs to be engaging
from the start


132
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,840
before people subscribe.


133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,611
And the best way to engage them
is through experiencing your app


134
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,813
and all of its
wonderful contents.


135
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,949
Being able to experience
and try before you buy


136
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,987
is a part of how we all make
purchase decisions today.


137
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:31,057
From trying on clothes
to attending an open house


138
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:35,061
or even test driving that car
before you buy or lease it.


139
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,397
People are able to experience


140
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,699
before they have to make
a purchase decision,


141
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,004
and the same principle
applies to your app.


142
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,107
There are three ways to engage
people through experience


143
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,243
and that will make it easier
for them to subscribe.


144
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,045
First is a free trial,


145
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,848
where people can try out
the entire app for free,


146
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,750
for a limited time.


147
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,320
Free trials work best
for established brands,


148
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,789
when people already have an idea
of what is included


149
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,357
with the subscription.


150
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,393
So if you have
an established brand,


151
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,927
a free trial is a great way


152
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
to let people engage
with your app


153
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,432
and experience it
before they subscribe.


154
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,335
You can also make the majority
of your app available for free


155
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:19,372
and offer a premium feature
as a subscription.


156
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,208
For example,
in the app Sleep Cycle,


157
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,778
you can use most of the features
for free,


158
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,113
but the Trends feature --
shown here --


159
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,117
is only available to people
who have subscribed.


160
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,887
Sleep Cycle makes it really easy
for people to sign up


161
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,455
right from here,


162
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,524
and this is a great technique
to offer people


163
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,493
a peak of the content
behind this blur,


164
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,530
as it gives people an idea
of the kind of data


165
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,599
they would see as a subscriber.


166
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,469
Third, sampling content
is a great way


167
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,272
to engage people
through experience.


168
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,375
Sampling helps people understand
what type of content


169
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,711
they would have access to
as a subscriber,


170
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,947
and this works well
for a majority of apps.


171
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,482
In the New York Times app,


172
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,018
you're able to read 10 articles
free per month


173
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,686
as a non-subscriber.


174
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,888
This is a great sampling
experience


175
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,058
because the New York Times
lets people have control


176
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,560
over what they sample,


177
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,428
and it allows people
to find the content


178
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,197
that they're interested in.


179
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,899
In turn, that helps them
better understand


180
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,069
the value
of the overall subscription.


181
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,939
The objective here is to let
people experience


182
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,975
and become engaged
with your app's content,


183
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,311
and that content
and that experience


184
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,547
will make it much easier
for them to subscribe.


185
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,716
So no matter which option
you choose,


186
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,785
make sure it works
for your audience.


187
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,621
Think about their current
user experience


188
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,690
and the type of content
that they currently have


189
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,558
available in your app


190
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,227
and how adding a subscription


191
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:50,330
could impact
that current experience.


192
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,932
So design your subscription
to be effortless


193
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,735
by being visible and reducing
friction to sign up,


194
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,505
be transparent with your terms
and pricing,


195
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,207
and engage people
before they subscribe


196
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,010
through a rich experience
of your app.


197
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,046
Then, it'll be easy to sign up.
