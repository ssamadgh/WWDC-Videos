attendees over 120 sessions over a

12
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,520
hundred hands-on labs where you can take
your code in and get to help tuning it
and porting it to some of our newer

13
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,570
devices and there are over a hundred
Apple engineers here this week a

16
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,239

talk about three things today you know

17
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:37,610
if the if the hardware is the the brain
and sinew of our products the software

18
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:45,019
in them is their sole and today we are
going to talk about software we've got

19
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:54,140
some great stuff to talk about
OS 10 lion iOS 5 and some kind of
interesting new cloud stuff so let's

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,530
start with Lion tell us all about Lion
I'm going to ask to my colleagues Phil

21
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:11,590
Schiller and Craig federighi to take us
through line and give us some demos pill

22
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,110
okay proceed

23
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:30,299
oh good morning everyone how you doing
yeah come on energy in the room this is

24
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:37,950
the Developer Conference that's what I
liked it I am really honored to be the
first to present to you the first of our

25
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,430
new products today in this product is
all about the Mac and the Mac is doing

26
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,819
incredibly well our customer base
continues to grow at a tremendous pace
we now have over 54 million active Mac

27
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,700
users around the world and growing the
customers love the products and press
and analysts have really incredible

28
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,940
things to say about it things like this
from All Things D there's really no

29
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:15,599
other way to say this the Mac is kicking
ass now that's really nice but what did

30
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,150
John mean well this is what he means the
last quarter the PC market actually

31
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:28,039
shrank year-over-year one percent while
the math grew 28%

32
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,570
in my book that's an ass-kicking now ass
do you think this is an aberration the

33
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,640
Mac has outgrown the industry every
quarter for the past five years it is

34
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,570
going so strong and it's because the
products are incredible products like

35
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,490
the new MacBook Air it's beautiful its
thin its light its fast the whole PC

36
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,660
industry wants to copy it but as you
know we've been leading in notebooks for

37
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,160
a while we're the first to really drive
the majority of our PC business to a

38
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,220
notebook business and it's almost
three-quarters of the Mac's we've

39
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,920
shipped today but whether you want a
great new notebook or a killer desktop

40
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,550
with the new iMac these Macs are the
best that we have ever made in the

41
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,060
history of Apple and they're great not
just because of the hardware they run

42
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,350
but because of the software Mac os10 is
the heart of the Mac and if you're

43
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,120
keeping track you know we launched Mac
OS 10 ten years ago we built it on a

44
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,460
solid UNIX foundation we added to it the
ease-of-use and simplicity that we know

45
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,440
Apple is renowned for and we built into
it amazing technologies for all of our

46
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,360
great developers to make the world's
best applications to run on it and for

47
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,070
those of you who are around and remember
this this is what Mac OS 10 looked like

48
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,630
ten years ago when we launched it

49
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,550
it was a revolution in its day and over
the last 10 years it's evolved to become

50
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,290
more refined more powerful more
beautiful than ever before the Mac os10

51
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:09,500
is looking incredibly strong so where do
we take it next well next up in OS 10 is

52
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,220
lying a major release with over 250 new
features and if you'd like me to go

53
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,530
through every one of them today yes
while I'd love to I'm told I don't have
enough time to tell you about 10 key new

54
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,490
features so we'll really get into 10
awesome features first up right into it

55
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,370
number one multi-touch gestures one of
the great things about the mat in the

56
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,210
beginning was that it uh sure Dan era of
a graphic unit user interface with a

57
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,530
mouse and cooking and dragging but so
much has changed over the last 10 years

58
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,150
we now build multi-touch trackpads into
all of our notebooks and we offer them

59
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,180
on our desktops we've learned a lot from
iOS as well

60
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,800
so now lion can count on multi-touch
from the beginning you can have

61
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,930
beautiful fluid momentum based scrolling
you can have incredible multi-touch taps

62
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,610
to zoom in on stories or pictures you
can dynamically zoom with beautiful

63
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,260
fluid pinch motions you can swipe
through your photographs your slides

64
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,400
your web pages all with an incredible
physical realism that's never been

65
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,900
possible the PC operating system before
and this has implications across the

66
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,580
system and a lot of little important
areas here's a simple example the scroll

67
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,970
bar why do we have scroll bar scroll
bars were there so it could click with

68
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,900
the mouse and drag and scroll but now if
you're pushing your window with
multi-touch you don't need them they can

69
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,120
disappear and if a much more beautiful
reading environment but when you go to

70
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,920
scroll they magically appear give you a
sense of place and proportional size and

71
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,210
then disappear when you don't need them
so multi-touch is now built throughout
the system in a very powerful way number

72
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,030
two full screen applications we've had
some full screen applications before and
these are really important for notebooks

73
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,670
11 inch and 13 inch where you want to
get take advantage of every pixel on the

74
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,860
display but developers have had to work
hard to make their applications

75
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,850
hand-coded to do full screen
including apps like like iPhoto well now

76
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,000
with lying we've built in a standard
method for developers to create full

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,530
screen applications and it has a simple
system control in the top right so all

78
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,000
users know where to tap and then bring
their applications full screen but this

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,570
isn't full screen like it was before
because now you can keep your

80
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,010
application running full screen with a
simple swipe gesture get back to your

81
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,240
desktop get something you need go back
to application never having left full

82
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,690
screen in fact you can have more than
one full screen application running at

83
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,219
the same time so we've worked on a
number of our applications to bring them

84
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,730
into the new full-screen mode of Lion
system applications like Safari mail

85
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:52,550
iCal iLife applications iPhoto iMovie
GarageBand I work with keynote numbers
and pages and all these applications

86
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,550
going fullscreen to have a great
experience right out of the box here's

87
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,620
an example of how it looks this is now
running fullscreen in Safari you can

88
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,830
have a beautiful place for viewing your
documents and now there's a new feature

89
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,500
since we've got all this extra room on
the left-hand side called the reading

90
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,890
list keep track of things want to get to
later

91
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:17,360
here's iCal running fullscreen here's
preview showing you PDF documents

92
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,110
running fullscreen so you just have a
beautiful experience like we've never

93
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,750
had on a computer before with full
screen applications next feature for

94
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,450
many users this will be the best feature
of Lion it's called Mission Control now

95
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,560
we all like to run a lot of software the
Apple we've created many features to
help customers find just what they need

96
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,089
expose for finding a document dashboard
for getting at a quick widget spaces for

97
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,250
organizing your work environment but did
it all work together in one unified way

98
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,940
well now with line we've unified that
with a simple gesture to get into

99
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,810
Mission Control and this is a bird's-eye
view of everything going on in your
system on the main window well that's

100
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,050
the current desktop you're working on
with all the documents now organized by
what application is running on them and

101
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,900
you can tap on any document and bring it
to the front that's right there Center

102
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,940
for you to work on up above are all your
spaces so you can have multiple desktops

103
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,500
you can have multiple full screen apps
running get to anyone with a single tab

104
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,250
and on the left of those spaces is a new
special one just for your dashboard

105
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,720
widgets you can get to again with a
single tab

106
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,430
so that's Mission Control and what I
like to do now is before we move on have
Craig federighi come up and give you a

107
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,300
demo of these three new features all
working together

108
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:45,730
Craig hello good morning so
let's take a look at lion in action

109
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,680
we're going to start with gestures great
played it place to experience gestures
is here in Safari the first thing you'll

110
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:00,009
notice is apparently something funny is
that how simple this UI looks because

111
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:04,449
there are no scroll bars it's a really
clean look we don't need scroll bars
anymore because we can simply push the

112
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,019
content with our fingers we can flick
and get momentum get a nice little

113
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:17,410
bounce the page feels really alive
beneath your fingers you can also expand

114
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:23,949
your fingers and fluidly zoom just like
that zoom out and you get a nice little

115
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:30,339
bounce page goes right back into place
if I want to smart zoom I just double

116
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:36,069
tap with two fingers it's smart zooms in
double tap again smart zooms out now I
want to show you something really cool

117
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,110
with gestures and that's how it can
navigate in Safari I'm going to drill

118
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,889
into a story and then after I've read it
I want to actually get back to the

119
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:49,779
previous page well now I can just take
two fingers and swipe the page right off

120
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,620
to the side and return back to my
previous page I want to get back and

121
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,370
swipe right back really fantastic in
fact I can swipe through my entire

122
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:10,089
Safari browsing history just like that
really smooth next up I'd like to show

123
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,899
you full screen apps let me launch
iPhoto here and you can see that I

124
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,220
photos adopted Lions and standard new
full screen control so I'll just take

125
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,839
lion or take iPhoto fullscreen it's a
great way to look at my photo album if I

126
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,949
want to get back to my desktop take
three fingers and I can just swipe the
desktop swipe iPhoto away and back to my

127
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,769
desktop but I didn't have to leave
iPhoto take it out of full screen it's

128
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:38,079
actually right there take a peek at it
go back just like that we loved this so

129
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,670
much that we made gestures accessible in
exactly the same way swipe over to the

130
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:48,040
left and I have access to my dashboard
you can see Safari supports full screen

131
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,509
as well let's go take our Safari window
full screen so now we have our dashboard

132
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,500
over our desktop over here to the left
we have Safari and of course I photos

133
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,079
still the
full screen as well you'll notice how

134
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,800
Safari is making great use of all the
available space on the screen for my

135
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,779
content if I want to get at my bookmarks
bar my menu just go to the top you see

136
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:12,880
they slide right out like that really
nicely and when I want to exit full

137
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,130
screen I have a control right there in
the upper right animates right back out

138
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,269
let's take a look now at photobooth this
is an app absolutely

139
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:27,579
born to run in full screen you can see
I'm surrounded by the curtains of the

140
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:32,199
the photobooth and in here I can
experience some fantastic new face

141
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:40,529
detection at fast so notice as I move
the birds actually track

142
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,449
it's right it's the most important
feature in line and we can also use this

143
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:54,459
base tracking technology to perform some
targeted facial enhancements for

144
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:59,170
instance I can finally have those big
eyes that I've always hoped for so let's

145
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:06,189
make a picture of that so that's that's
pretty cool so playing around yeah

146
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:11,829
that's great stuff so you know you can
spend hours at this so fullscreen is

147
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,179
fantastic but of course Mac users love
to get do a lot of things at once and

148
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,079
that often means that they have a lot of
windows in fact my desktop often looks a

149
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,669
little bit more like this right I've got
a lot going on so how do I get across

150
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:28,809
all of those different activities well I
just take three fingers swipe up on the

151
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:33,819
trackpad and I'm in Mission Control from
here I can get at any window I want so

152
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:37,839
if I want to get it I Cal here I click
it comes forward sweet back into Mission

153
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,309
Control over to dictionary same thing
and across the top you see I have my
dashboard my desktop my full screen apps

154
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:50,079
so I want to get to iPhoto just click
comes forward from anywhere three
fingers up and I'm back in Mission

155
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:57,100
Control I can also quick look my windows
if I just hit spacebar here get a better

156
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,299
look at my calendar or take this pile of
preview windows and spread them apart

157
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:05,589
with a little gesture up but you know
what's really awesome is the way that

158
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:09,220
multiple desktop spaces are now
integrated right into Mission Control

159
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,089
just take my mouse up to the corner of
the screen and the little space pops up

160
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,669
I click I've just created a new space
and I can populate it by just dragging
the windows I want to work within that

161
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:27,089
space just like this I've set up a new
desk

162
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,029
really useful I can swipe through the
spaces of course here in admission

163
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,399
control go over to my desktop and if I
want to then take even an entire app and

164
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,550
all of its windows and create a new
space for that I can click on the

165
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,990
preview icon drag the whole pile to the
corner I've just created another space

166
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:51,360
and the spaces are just as easy to clean
up as they were to create I just click

167
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,740
they delete and they float windows fly
right back to my original desktop space

168
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,040
so that is Mission Control thank you
very much

169
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,060
Thank You Craig to see how these new
features now work seamlessly together to

170
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,050
create an incredible experience in OS 10
unlike anything we've had on a personal

171
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,850
computer before
next up the Mac App Store we launched

172
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:25,040
the Mac App Store this past January and
users have found out that it is the best
place to purchase and discover new

173
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:32,570
software applications now for years
there have been many software channels

174
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,829
to buy PC software and they all work
kind of the same way you hop in your car
you drive downtown you buy a DVD if they

175
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,160
happen to have it you drive back home
you load it up or you wait for it to

176
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,820
come mail-order will no more well now
with the Mac App Store you can get your

177
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,540
software right from the comfort of your
own home on your Mac and in the last six
months something incredible has happened

178
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,750
the last six months the Mac App Store
has now become the number one PC

179
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:05,360
software channel for buying software
that's incredible passing Best Buy and

180
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,349
Walmart and Office Depot and the
developers that have gotten on board

181
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:14,359
with the Mac App Store seen some great
success - for example Autodesk they

182
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,688
brought their SketchBook Pro application
to it and since they've put it on the

183
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,520
Mac App Store they've seen a million new
users on the Mac feral interactive has

184
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,429
brought a host of games including Mini
Ninjas hopefully you've all played it

185
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:32,179
doubling of overall revenue since they
brought into the Mac App Store and small

186
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,470
great developers like Pixelmator has
brought their amazing new image editing

187
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,429
application to the Mac App Store they've
seen a quadrupling of the revenue in

188
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:45,440
fact they made a million dollars in the
first 20 days so the Mac App Store has

189
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,700
been a big hit for large and small
developers so what's new in lying well

190
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,000
first its built right in you don't have
to go and download it and get it and

191
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,690
decide to use it it's built in for every
Mac user and there's a lot of great

192
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,929
features for you developers to take
advantage of some of them you're used to

193
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:05,360
from the iOS App Store like in-app
purchases you can now build those in
push notifications if you want to alert

194
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,700
users about important information you
can make your applications more secure

195
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,809
there's a built-in sandboxing method now
in the Mac App Store and for users

196
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:19,679
downloads will be even faster because
you can get these updates as Delta

197
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,970
updates so that's the Mac app so it's a
really important part of the whole

198
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,799
experience of line is you'll hear more
about number 5 a simple but powerful

199
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,490
idea
Launchpad would it be great if no matter

200
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,730
where you are in your system if you want
to get in an application and quickly

201
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,409
launch it you can with a simple gesture
well now you can with Launchpad you

202
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:47,580
simply make a simple gesture a pinch
motion and all your applications fly
onto your screen no matter where they

203
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,020
are in your system
Launchpad knows where they are you can

204
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,210
have multiple pages of applications that
you can organize any way you want when

205
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,600
you go and buy a new application on the
Mac App Store and downloads installs
right into your Launchpad and you can

206
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,600
make it look however you'd like you can
rearrange your icons you can create
folders just as we're used to from iOS

207
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:18,169
and now you can do that on your Mac as
well so that's Launchpad next resume

208
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:22,350
here's a simple idea from the beginning
with the computer you've had to run
applications sometimes you quit them you

209
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:28,440
go back and you're back at the starting
point you get you have no more windows

210
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,890
open your documents aren't open you
usually have to pick a template why

211
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,809
can't applications get you back to work
quickly well that's what resume does now
when you launch an application and lyan

212
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,020
it brings you right back to where you
were when you quit it remembers what

213
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,260
documents you were opened remembers the
text that was selected in the document

214
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,679
remembers where the palettes were in the
windows and everything just how you like

215
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,960
it
and resume doesn't work just on an

216
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,429
application it works system-wide so the
next time you have to shutdown and

217
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,700
restart your your math for a reason
maybe you've installed some new software

218
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,840
and it asks you to reboot get you like
everything just the way it is well don't
worry you get the new login window you

219
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,380
log in and line will bring you back to
the work environment as you left it when

220
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,520
you restarted all your applications
running all those spaces you set up all
just the way you like it

221
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:27,559
so that's resumed number seven autosave
from the beginning of using computers

222
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,910
we've all had to remember one really
important fact save save save all your

223
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,540
work as you're going whether it's file
save or command S on the Mac you better
keep saving it's the one time you might

224
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,549
forget to save what you're doing
something goes wrong and what are you

225
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:45,290
going to hear you should have saved what
you're doing why should you why can't

226
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,610
the computer help you well that's what
Lyon does as you're creating a document

227
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,120
Lyon can automatically save it in the
background without you having to do

228
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,630
anything but I was happy to see anything
your work is just being saved for you

229
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,770
this is a really powerful but simple
thing but but as we got into we found
there's more things we can do for you

230
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,160
since we're Auto saving so if you zoom
in on the title bar of your documents

231
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,190
you'll see the name of your document is
actually a menu now that you can tap on

232
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,700
and take advantage of the power of
autosave but for example let's say

233
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,880
you're doing work and you don't like the
work you did and you're worried it got

234
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,240
auto saved over what you liked that
you've done previously well now I can

235
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,100
just select revert to last open and get
back to where you were when you started

236
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,490
maybe you love the changes you've made
and they're exactly what you want you

237
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,220
don't want it to ever get auto saved
over it again because it's perfect the

238
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,970
way it is you can just select lock and
now your documents locked it's like a

239
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,049
template and nothing can ever change it
you can even right from within the

240
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:44,030
application select duplicate and create
a second document just like the first

241
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,120
one that you can start working on
another version so you have the power of

242
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,700
all of this right from the title bar of
your window so that's auto save now auto

243
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,470
save gave us a great idea to go even
further with the next feature and that's

244
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,900
called versions so you're working on a
document you're entering the text you're

245
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,120
formatting you're adding copy you're
adding graphics and all along autosave
is saving your document in fact it's

246
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,860
saving all these versions of your
document as you're working so we call

247
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,610
that versions it's automatic you don't
have to do anything we'll do it for you

248
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,299
with Lyon if you love something at a
split second you can of course take a

249
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:27,500
manual snapshot if you want and it's
very efficient we only store the

250
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,740
difference between the versions there
are

251
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,790
new documents and you don't have to
worry if you ever share your work with

252
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,760
someone else that they're going to get
all that back work that you won't don't

253
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,840
want them to get when you copy it off or
you send it an email we only send the

254
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,520
current version so how do you get it
take advantage of this power of autosave

255
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,160
inversions
well again go back to that menu on the

256
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,760
top and there's another choice there
that you may have noticed browse all

257
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,320
versions you tap on it and you get this
beautiful new interface it looks a lot

258
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,640
like time machine but rather than being
about your whole system it's about that

259
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,870
one document you're working on on the
left is the current version on the right
all the past versions and you have a

260
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,540
time scale on the right just like time
machine you can scroll back through them

261
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,990
and they're all live you can switch you
make any one the current one you can

262
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,460
even cut and paste between them so
that's versions what I like to do is ask

263
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,550
Craig to come back up and give another
demo so how this all works together

264
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,080
Craig again

265
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,320
alright well let's let's start with
Launchpad you see it's an icon right

266
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,570
here on my dock I click I get an instant
view of all of the applications on my

267
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,810
system no matter where they're installed
I can page through them really nicely

268
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,340
with gestures and when I want to launch
let's say like address book it's just a

269
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,470
single click to bring it up can also
gesture with a forefinger pinch to get

270
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:56,040
in as well so of course when I want to
add things to my Launchpad the best way

271
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,000
to do that is with the Mac App Store I'm
going to launch it right here you can

272
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,590
see on the Mac App Store we have great
featured applications top paid and free

273
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:10,440
apps categories we have also all of your
purchase tabs so then if you buy another

274
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,260
Mac or you buy on one Mac you want to
get the app on the other one you can

275
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,540
download them here at no additional
charge

276
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,920
and of course updates with just a click
you can bring all the apps you have

277
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,680
installed on your system from the App
Store up to date

278
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,660
well now let's try adding Twitter to our
Mac we're going to click here go to the

279
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,430
Twitter product page and with a click
you can buy the app actually lifts up

280
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:37,080
out of the App Store and flies right
into my Launchpad downloads and is ready
to use

281
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,750
from here I can just click and position
it wherever I want I can move it maybe

282
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,950
to the first page and as you see we have
folders like this productivity folder

283
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,600
works great I want to create my own
folder just pick something up drop it
and I've created a folder just like that

284
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,810
in Launchpad next I'd like to show you
just how fantastic the Mac is now with

285
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,640
Lion working with documents I'm going to
open the document that I've been working

286
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,450
on here on the history of guitars when I
start editing a document often I'll

287
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,160
position my windows just the way I like
them like this maybe open up some

288
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,420
inspectors position them the way I want
them and then I'll set down to editing

289
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,650
now this guitar this looks maybe a
little bit too metal for my target

290
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:28,470
audience so I'll delete that take take
this move it aside maybe change the font

291
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,120
here on this on this document so I'm
done with my edits for now and I'm going
to quit I want you to watch what happens

292
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,540
when I quit

293
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:44,120
absolutely nothing I wasn't prompted to
say I didn't need to be because Lyon was
actually saving for me all along but it

294
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,170
wasn't just saving my document it was
saving exactly the state of how I was

295
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:56,240
working so now when I go back and launch
pages again you see it brings back all

296
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,020
my inspectors just the way they were
brings back my window position where it

297
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,920
was and even has my text selection
highlighted just as I left it

298
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,200
perfect restore but we're not just
storing the latest version of the

299
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,850
document we're keeping a history of the
document as it's edited so if I want to
go back maybe I regret these edits I

300
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,000
want to get back to the previous version
I go right here and browse all versions

301
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,160
and I'm taken right into the star field
where I get a view of my current version

302
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,780
on the left and the history on the right
if I want this previous version to

303
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:35,390
become current I click restore it picks
up flies on top and becomes the current

304
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,260
version of my document and I'm restored
but you saw that was actually more

305
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,280
history than that I'll go back into the
star field here you can see I actually

306
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,960
have a full timeline here on the right I
can go back to the very beginning of

307
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,740
this document when it was just a few
paragraphs or step forward as I was

308
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,530
adding pages and so forth but when I
restore a document you know very often

309
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,500
I don't want really the whole old
version I like mostly what my new

310
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,070
document has become but often I want to
harvest maybe just an image or perhaps a

311
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,050
particular slide and bring it into the
current version with versions I can

312
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,970
because these two windows are actually
live here so if I have on my current

313
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,840
version maybe a page that could really
use an image to punch it up a little bit

314
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,440
I go back to this past version I see oh
look there's there's a guitar that would

315
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,510
be just perfect well I can just select
the guitar in the old version copy it

316
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:32,210
and then paste it right into the latest
version and like that I've created just

317
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:39,950
the document I was
looking for and that's version thanks

318
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:49,590
Thank You Craig next number nine well as
long as we've had computers we wanted to

319
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,010
share documents we have a new feature to
help you do that and make it easier than

320
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,270
ever it's called airdrop you've got your
computer your friends got their computer

321
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,440
and trying to get documents between them
has always been such a pain in fact the

322
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,000
easiest way to do this that no one's
done better than is good old sneakernet

323
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,650
copy it off of one walk over your
friend's computer copy it back on

324
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,860
Millian solves that with a new
technology airdrop that's a peer-to-peer
Wi-Fi based network so how does it work

325
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,570
when you go into the finder in line
you'll see on the sources on the left a

326
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,480
new choice called airdrop you tap it you
get a new display inside the finder what

327
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,460
you see is yourself Center bottom right
there and the people around you who are

328
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,230
also running airdrop at the same time
you see their pictures I'm going to drag

329
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,059
a document over to Shawna's computer I
just drag the document on top of her

330
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,080
picture and it asked me are you sure you
want to send this and I confirm I do now

331
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,340
in Shauna's computer because she's also
now running airdrop she sees pops up

332
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,059
over my picture I'm trying to send her a
document she confirms she wants to

333
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,290
receive it and it downloads right into a
Downloads folder and that's it that's

334
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,670
what it takes to now wirelessly share
files between line computers so it's a

335
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,450
peer-to-peer Wi-Fi based network there's
nothing to set up it's Auto discovery

336
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:13,200
Auto setup we have confirmation on both
ends just to be safe and your data is

337
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,890
protected over the air because it's
fully encrypted as it's transferred so

338
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,030
that's airdrop that brings us to number
10
[Applause]

339
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:28,590
number ten is mail a completely new
version of mail in Lyon it's beautiful
the layout on it is incredible it works

340
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,190
in a window it takes advantage of full
screen you can work in a two-column or

341
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,490
if you want to have access to your mail
sources a three column view right there

342
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,900
on the left and you see that the design
of it's really optimized around reading

343
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,980
your mail have a beautiful full height
message window on the left and the

344
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,960
message list you see snippets like we
used to from iOS now built into mail

345
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,410
across the top you have a favorites bar
sort of like a browser does now in mail

346
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,900
that can be favorite folders where you
like to keep things you want to get at

347
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:03,330
quickly probably the most one of the
most powerful features is searching with
searching now we have new search

348
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,720
suggestions so you start to type what
you're looking for and mail recognizes

349
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,990
whether that's a person or a subject and
prompts you with the choices you have

350
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:17,550
across your entire mail database what
you can find quickly when you select one

351
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,570
it becomes what we call a search token
that's an interactive search token where

352
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,570
you can set some parameters on it and
you can have more than one create

353
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,290
boolean searches if you want but
probably the best feature of the new

354
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:34,400
mail is something we call yes you can
love to add it's okay boolean search is

355
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,070
probably the best feature something we
call conversation view in mail today as
you've got a conversation going you've

356
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,580
got some messages we responded to or
replied and forwards you see the mail

357
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,510
gets longer and longer and they're
indented and color coded things stripped

358
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:55,140
out it gets more and more difficult to
follow the flow of this and appreciate

359
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,300
the messages that were sent well now in
line is a brand-new conversation view
that shows your messages just as they

360
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,180
were sent

361
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,690
you see the messages you see the people
who send them you see the attachments

362
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,160
still in line all there for you to view
it's completely compatible with doing

363
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,429
email with other people who don't have
line and can't get the same beautiful

364
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:20,190
view
so that's male and lion I'd like to

365
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:29,490
bring Craig up for one last demo to show
off male okay well I absolutely love the

366
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:34,200
new male in Lion let's let's take a look
so it's got this great full height

367
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,780
message list perfect for laptops just
like this I've got my message list on

368
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,210
the side with snippets makes it really
easy to find the message I'm looking for

369
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:50,250
with this new favorites bar across the
top so I can click through my mailboxes

370
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,780
really easily but if I want to get back
to my full list they're available right

371
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,480
here as well I really find the new
search to be just awesome because when I

372
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,350
search I'm often searching for a person
let's say like Bill I start typing pH

373
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:09,240
see it prompts me for people in my mail
right now that match so I go Phil

374
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,490
Schiller found messages from Phil just
like that I can use it can retarget the

375
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,500
search to specific inboxes or search all
and of course as Phil showed you I can

376
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,230
pick whether I'm searching for from two
or the entire message

377
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,789
well suggestions don't just apply to
searching for people they also work for

378
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:30,570
other things as well like let's say a
subject I'll search for trip you see

379
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,600
that it's actually prompting me do you
want to search for messages the contain

380
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,370
trip or where trip just appears in the
subject line or even suggest specific

381
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:42,750
subject lines that match so I can select
this and I've done a subject search on

382
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,039
trip what about dates I'm going to type
March start typing March

383
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,940
there you see it prompts me March 2011
like that I've searched for all my

384
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,690
messages in March but what's really
awesome is the way you can combine these

385
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,770
really quickly to pinpoint just the
search you're looking for so let's say

386
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,820
looking for a message about that Phil
sent me it's the subject was something

387
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,820
about reservation it was from Phil
Schiller and it was last month like that

388
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,740
drills down to exactly the message

389
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:22,089
it's really nice as awesome as that is
my favorite feature is conversations so

390
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:27,549
this beautiful view all the messages
that were sent in the conversation just

391
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:31,269
as they were sent with all the images
and so forth and you'll notice that all

392
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,739
of that extra forwarded reply text
that's redundant in the conversation is

393
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:40,239
stripped right out it's gone but if I
want to show it I want to see mail the

394
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:44,499
way it kind of looks in lessor mail
programs I can click like this it folds

395
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:49,710
right out yeah this is awesome

396
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:55,929
if I want to reply to a particular
message in a conversation I can hover we

397
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:01,299
get a reply control and watch this
animation loop so message hops right out

398
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:05,379
so that's great and finally when you
want to file a whole conversation away

399
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:10,359
you can just drag it all at once drag
all the messages put it your folder and

new with Lion server isn't another

409
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,920
operating system it's just a bunch of
applications you can purchase to run on

410
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,900
top of Lion so amazing depth of features
for you and for all the developers out

411
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,900
here we have over 3,000 new API for you
to take advantage of the power of Lion

412
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,930
amazing stuff you can do all the things
we showed here you can have full screen
applications you can create versions you

413
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:19,599
can take advantage of autosave all of
that can easily be done with all these

414
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,400
new api's so line is an incredible new
new release so how are we going to get

415
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,170
it well in the past one thing every
version of Mac OS 10 is shared in common

416
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:36,250
is it came on an optical disk no more
now line.we available only in the Mac

417
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,920
App Store
[Applause]

418
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:47,450
and that allows us to make it the
easiest upgrade you have ever seen when

419
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,870
it's ready you'll go into the Mac App
Store and you'll see a page there where

420
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,770
you can read about it see screenshots
read reviews when you're ready click buy

421
00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:00,010
and it downloads right onto your Mac and
starts the upgrade process right there

422
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,580
so it's on the Mac App Store will be
about four gigabytes in size about the
same size as a single HD movie that you

423
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:10,550
might download it installs right in
place no more rebooting from an optical

424
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,140
disk and because it's part of the Mac
apps from the Mac App Store rules it
follows the same rules when you purchase

425
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,060
it you can use it on all of your
personal authorized max you have to buy

426
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:29,000
multiple copies that's where I am I know
what you're thinking what should we

427
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,100
charge for this but what would you
charge on the past most major leases of

428
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,910
Mac OS 10 have been one hundred and
twenty nine dollars and I think there's

429
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,140
a lot here for $129 but we love it so
much that we want to make it available

430
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:48,400
to even more people so we're going to
price it at just $29.99

431
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,060
I was hoping you're going to like that
so when do you all get your hands on it

432
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,060
here at the conference we're going to
have a Developer Preview the latest

433
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,570

436
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,800
products we wanted to tell you about
today

437
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,470
the next product we're going to talk
about is iOS 5 and to do that I'd like
to invite up Scott Forstall

438
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,759
welcome so I'm here to tell you about
iOS five before I get into the cool

439
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:58,059
stuff let me give you a quick update on
iOS as you know iOS powers the iPhone

440
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:07,569
the iPad and the iPod Touch and to date
we have sold wait for it over two
hundred million iOS devices and that

441
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:23,650
makes iOS the number one mobile
operating system with more than forty

442
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:33,279
four percent at forty four percent of
the market now the latest addition to

443
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:38,920
the iOS family is the iPad 2 which is an
incredible product even thinner and

444
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,180
lighter than the original it comes in
black and white it has cameras on the
front and back it is an amazing product

445
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:51,099
and our customers just couldn't wait to
get their hands on it or else they'd

446
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:57,009
actually did have to wait to get their
hands on it in the first fourteen months

447
00:38:57,009 --> 00:39:04,499
we have already sold more than
twenty-five million iPads

448
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,440
we created a whole new category of
device with the iPad and have sold more

449
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,100
than 25 million with the iPad to joins
the iPhone and the iPod Touch for an

450
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,660
incredible lineup of iOS devices and
we've got some great stores to go along

451
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:31,220
with these as well like the iTunes music
store we've already sold more than 15

452
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:41,370
billion songs from the iTunes music
store this course makes it the number

453
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:46,350
one retailer of music in the world
next is the iBook store you know we

454
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:51,150
launched the iBook store just a little
more than a year ago already all six

455
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,040
major publishers have signed up and are
providing books to the bookstore our

456
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:02,090
customers love it our customers have
downloaded more than 130 million books

457
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:13,680
great and of course there's the App
Store now the size and momentum of the
App Store is really hard to fathom there

458
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:24,330
are currently more than 425 thousand
apps on the App Store and more than 90

459
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:30,150
thousand of these were made specifically
for the iPad they take full advantage of

460
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,800
the large touchscreen display and they
make the iPad a better product so we'd

461
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,780
like to thank our developers for these
great apps

462
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:49,450
now our customers love it our customers
have downloaded more than 14 billion

463
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:58,090
apps from the App Store and that's in
less than three years it's amazing now

464
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:03,910
our developers are being well rewarded
for this Apple so far has paid out more
than two and a half billion dollars to

465
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,610
developers building apps for the App
Store thank you

466
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,700
now these apps as you know cover every
genre imaginable there's great travel

467
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,910
apps like this walking tour from Lonely
Planet they're incredibly addictive

468
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:34,530
games I'd say even mind controlling the
addictive games like tiny wings great

469
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,359
entertainment titles like HBO GO which
lets you take HBO wherever you are and
you can watch it right on your iPad

470
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:47,940
they're deep apps like mobile mem which
allow physicians to look at CT scans and

471
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:54,420
PET scans right on their iPad and this
has been fda-approved this next one from

472
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:00,200
Jepsen's been FAA approved and it allows
pilots to look at the charts and the
maps for airports around the world right

473
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:09,660
on their iPad and there's great business
apps out there like WebEx which allows
you to have a multi-party video

474
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:17,940
conference and really hold a virtual
meeting so some great apps out there for

475
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:24,270
our stores we have more than 225 million
accounts all with credit cards and

476
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,349
one-click purchasing to make it really
easy for our customers to find what they

477
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:32,130
want purchase it and download it
directly to their device

478
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:38,550
these stores go with an incredible
lineup of iOS devices let's talk about

479
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,500
the future of iOS and that is iOS 5

480
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:53,160
iOS 5 is a major release this is
incredible for our developers and for
our customers

481
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,390
for developers there are more than 1500
new api's and some great enhancements to

482
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:07,350
our tools for our for our users there
are more than 200 new features let me go

483
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:16,190
ahead and walk you through ten now
number one notifications

484
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,849
I'm sure you're all familiar with
notifications you look something like

485
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:34,220
this it looks best when giants are on
top so you get scoring alerts you have
alerts to pop up they game to audio

486
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:42,140
they can also badge the home screen
icons well these have been massively

487
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:48,559
popular in fact we have already pushed
more than a hundred billion push

488
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:54,769
notifications is scaled beautifully
we've heard from our customers they're
receiving so money they'd like a better

489
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,519
UI to get them and we agree and so we
have built something that solves some of
the problems in the current one

490
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,180
currently when you get a notification it
interrupts you if you're playing a game

491
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,990
you get a modal alert you have to deal
with that mode alert before you can go

492
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:16,430
on also in the lock screen you get this
nice list of things that have happened

493
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,880
while your phone's been locked but when
you unlock it

494
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,690
that list isn't persistent there's no
way to get back to that list and go

495
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,609
through those notifications well we have
designed the solution that solves those

496
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:34,819
issues and goes far beyond it and we
call it notification center Notification

497
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:42,619
Center is a single place which combines
together all of your notifications you

498
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:47,660
can get to it at any time from anywhere
on your iPhone or iPad or iPod touch
just by swiping your finger down from

499
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:53,950
the top to reveal the Notification
Center

500
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:05,059
so we think it is beautiful it has your
missed calls and voicemails text

501
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:10,400
messages mail messages scoring alerts
Facebook updates any push notifications

502
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,660
that come from the App Store all end up
right here in Notification Center and
we've even added stocks and weather

503
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:23,539
right up top now we didn't stop there
notifications are no longer interrupting

504
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:28,430
so now if you're playing a game and
someone sends you say a text message get
a nice animation from the top it's right

505
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:39,109
there you can keep on playing your game
and it'll automatically dismiss itself
if you have just tapped on it it would

506
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:43,700
take you to that app but doesn't matter
because you can always get back to at

507
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,989
any time just by swiping your finger
down from the top we've also improved

508
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:54,160
the lock screen you can see more
information for notifications here

509
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,960
and one of my favorite features is for
any one of the notifications in the lock

510
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,580
screen you can just slide your finger
across it and it takes you directly to

511
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:16,180
the app that sent the notification let
me go ahead just show this to you now so

512
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:22,000
I've got a phone here running iOS 5 you
see more information there now I'm just

513
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,730
going to swipe my finger right across
that text message and it takes me

514
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,420
directly to the messages app and right
into the conversation it's really

515
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:35,560
convenient now to get to the
Notification Center just swipe my finger

516
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,110
down from the top and there it is
dismiss it by swiping up really nice

517
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:47,920
animation you can see that we're still
in winter here in San Francisco I get

518
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,620
all of my messages here so text messages
and scoring alerts down at the bottom

519
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:59,500
here I have some alerts from mlb.com at
bat if I tap on that X button I can just

520
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,580
go ahead and clear that out if I see
another notification like the Facebook

521
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:08,920
one I tap on it takes me directly to the
Facebook app so it's really convenient

522
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,880
and at anytime again
swipe down from the top and you get back

523
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,540
to Notification Center and that is
Notification Center

524
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:36,380
number two is newsstand you know I love
reading newspapers and magazines right

525
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:42,830
on my iphone my iPad and recently we
added subscriptions this makes it easier

526
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:47,359
for you get all the new issues without
missing anything already

527
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,070
most of the major publishers of
magazines and many of newspapers have

528
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:58,300
signed up to support subscriptions now
these are incredible titles things like

529
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:05,630
National Geographic and spin to great
music magazines and of course when you

530
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,619
read these on your iPad you get audio
and video in addition to all the

531
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:16,640
articles Vanity Fair science magazines
like Popular Mechanics and popular
science Esquire GQ fashion magazines

532
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:29,240
like Elle The Oprah Magazine tech
magazines like Wired and automobile
magazines and sports magazines The New

533
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:39,380
Yorker and newspapers new ones like the
daily but also the New York Times the

534
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:46,490
San Francisco Chronicle Daily Telegraph
and other international papers and we've
now created a single place right in the

535
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,830
app store that combines all of these
newspaper and magazines so you can find

536
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:00,380
them all in one place when you purchase
them they're automatically downloaded

537
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:05,930
and placed in the newsstand it's a new
place right on the home screen looks
like it's beautiful news rack in

538
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:13,359
addition to this we do background
downloads

539
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,799
so if a new issue comes out say of a
newspaper while you're sleeping when you

540
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:29,020
wake up and pick up your iPad that new
newspaper is already there ready for you

541
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,700
to read it and you can read it offline

542
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:40,470
on top of this we set the cover to be
the front page of the new newspaper and

543
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:44,730
we'll set it to be the cover of the new
magazine for magazines

544
00:49:44,730 --> 00:50:00,700
so that is newsstand next is Twitter now
as I'm sure everyone's familiar Twitter

545
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,920
is an incredibly popular service people
send more than a billion tweets per week

546
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,020
and we hear from a lot of our customers
on iPhone and iPad and iPod touch that

547
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,029
they love Twitter and so we want to make
it even easier for all of our customers

548
00:50:16,029 --> 00:50:21,069
to use Twitter on iOS products we're
doing a number of things for this first

549
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:27,130
we're adding single sign-on so now when
you go to the Settings app its built in

550
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:32,049
on the iPhone or iPad you can enter your
username and password and now you're

551
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:36,099
configured for Twitter for any app you
download off the App Store it'll just

552
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:39,730
say can I use your credentials when you
say yes you're logged in you don't need

553
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:45,059
to real aughh in every single time so
single sign-on

554
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:52,950
next we've integrated Twitter in with
many of our apps like camera and photos
so now if you're at a concert you take a

555
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,670
photo you want to tweet that photo just
tap on the action button it's a new

556
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:06,119
option tweet and it brings up this
beautiful tweet sheet gives you a nice

557
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,049
thumbnail of the photo give you a
countdown of how many characters you

558
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:15,839
have left to type and you can even
optionally add your location tap on that

559
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,599
and now you've tweeted the photo it's
that simple

560
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:30,960
in addition to tweeting from photos and
camera you can tweet articles from

561
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,670
Safari websites you can tweet videos
from YouTube and you can tweet about

562
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:41,279
businesses or locations for maps beyond
all of this we added integration with

563
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:45,869
contacts now you might have a lot of
contacts that don't have photos but

564
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,619
Twitter may have photos for those people
and so you can use Twitter to

565
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:55,710
automatically update the photos in your
contact list and even the at user name

566
00:51:55,710 --> 00:52:01,759
for your friends that's Twitter
integration throughout the OS

567
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:13,620
next is Safari
you know Safari is the best mobile web

568
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:19,380
browser out there it's also the most
popular in fact nearly two-thirds of all

569
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:26,490
mobile web browsing is done on Safari
beyond this we took apples Safari engine
and open sourced it and it's the basis

570
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:36,540
of all web browsing on Android so Safari
engine is the basis of more than 90% of

571
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:42,870
all web browsing on mobile devices well
iOS 5 we're making Safari even better

572
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:49,110
we've got some great features the first
is reader Safari reader becomes

573
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:54,270
available up here as a new button when
you're reading a story on a website if

574
00:52:54,270 --> 00:53:00,390
you just tap on that button we take the
story you're reading and make it front

575
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:04,320
and center we get rid of all the
distractions set the font size rights

576
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,630
and even if it's a multi-page story so
you'd have to tap through multiple web

577
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:14,700
pages normally to get to it we put in a
single scrolling story it's really
convenient

578
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:28,000
on top of that you can now email the
contents of the story before you could

579
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,310
just email the link but now when you
email you get the link plus the contents

580
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:41,890
in your compose window and all and all
of this works really well on the iPad it

581
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:46,390
works great on the iPhone as well it's a
perfect size for it sets the font size

582
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,849
right it's really nice to read stories
so that's the for a reader the second

583
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:58,869
one is reading lists reading lists is a
simple and convenient way for you to

584
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:04,660
quickly save a story to read it later
just put it in the reading list and when
you add an item to reading list it gets

585
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:11,290
added to the reading list on all of your
iOS devices and even the reading list on

586
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:15,810
Safari on Mac and Safari on Windows

587
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,830
so if you don't have time to finish it
here on the iPad you can finish reading

588
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:30,340
it later on your iPhone and the next
feature is tabbed browsing we have added

589
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:35,760
full tab browsing and Safari on the iPad

590
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,400
and you know let me just show it to you

591
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:51,070
alright so here I have my iPad running
iOS 5 I'll launch Safari here and the

592
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:54,790
first thing you'll see with tabbed
browsing is it is lightning fast to

593
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,390
switch between Windows now just tap on
it and you're there

594
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:05,440
great now I'm on the DP review site
which is a fantastic review site for

595
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,660
cameras and they have really extensive
reviews in fact you don't have to tap

596
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,440
through many many pages to read the
whole review if I look at this one here

597
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:21,910
it's a 20 pages long if I tap the reader
button here it loads the entire story up

598
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,680
and reader now I can just scroll through
it gets rid of all the distractions lets

599
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:32,040
me concentrate just in the content that
is reader

600
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:41,490
you even see that when it goes between
pages here where you would have had to
you know tap to say next page it

601
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,349
automatically gives you a little page
break so you know when it's going

602
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:50,010
through those pages now let's say if I
don't have time to finish the story

603
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:57,119
right now I can just tap the bookmarks
bar item and here I have reading list I

604
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,770
tap plus and now it's added this to my
reading list and again I can go finish

605
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:08,339
this on Mac on you know on Safari on my
Mac or any of my other iOS devices it's

606
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:11,700
great and if I really like this and I
want to tweet about it let me show you

607
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:17,099
the Twitter integration while we're here
by tap tweet brings up the tweet sheet

608
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:22,430
we do completions of a hit I have a
friend Gary done so I hit at G
automatically fills in the name tap that

609
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:35,490
and say you know I like this one and I
can optionally add my location tap send

610
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:40,740
and it's tweeted it's that easy so some
really great Safari enhancements and

611
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,970
Twitter integration throughout

612
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:59,360
all right next up these reminders you
know all of us are constantly creating

613
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,380
lists of things list of things to do
list of things to buy like a grocery

614
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:09,690
list some of them have a place
associated like don't forget to walk the

615
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:13,680
dog when I get home and some have a time
associated say buy concert tickets

616
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,530
Monday at 10:00 a.m. so that's when they
go on sale wouldn't be great if you get

617
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:24,240
rid of all these scraps of paper and
store all this on your phone but beyond
that if your phone actually reminded you

618
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:31,320
to do things as opposed to just
statically keeping a list of things well

619
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,610
that's exactly what the reminders app
does on the reminders app you can store

620
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:39,810
lists of things multiple lists of things
for a trip to San Francisco or birthday

621
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:46,170
party or a grocery list you can store
dates associated with these reminders so

622
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:52,470
you'll be reminded on that date you can
also sign location this is really cool I
could set up a reminder to say remind me

623
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:01,110
to call my wife when I leave the
convention today and it'll set a

624
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,540
geofence
up around Moscone Center and so when I

625
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,940
get in my car to leave it will pop up
and say call

626
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:20,880
it solves the problem of unliving right
now I promise call in the car you can of

627
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,620
course search through all your reminders
and reminders will sync with iCal on the

628
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:31,560
Mac using CalDAV and even without look
on Windows using exchange and that is

629
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,100
reminders

630
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:48,430
next this camera you know the iPhone 4
is widely regarded as having one of the
best cameras on a mobile phone it's also

631
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:57,280
one of the most popular in fact if you
look at cameras used to take photos and

632
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:04,840
then post them to Flickr now this is all
cameras not just cameras on phones you

633
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:13,120
see where the iPhone 4 is it is already
by far the most popular camera on a
phone to take photos and it very soon

634
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:20,500
will be the most popular camera overall
but we want to make using the camera

635
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,700
even better and that's what we're doing
the first thing we're doing is making it

636
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,010
way faster just get in and take a photo

637
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,619
so now it's there's some moment
happening your kids doing something

638
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:42,160
really cute you want to capture it you
double-click that home button you get a
new camera icon when you tap on that

639
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,490
camera icon you're brought directly and
immediately to the camera and you're

640
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:51,690
ready to take a photo now

641
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:59,710
what's really cool about this is even if
you have a passcode set will take you

642
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:03,609
right into take a new photo will protect
it and you can't see any previous photos

643
01:00:03,609 --> 01:00:06,339
you've taken or anything else in the
phone without typing your passcode

644
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:11,109
you can start taking a passcode a
picture immediately and you can even use

645
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:14,970
the volume up button now to click

646
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:28,750
and that sound I think people say use
the shutter button to turn your volume

647
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:38,710
up so in addition to this we've added
optional gridlines so you can use the

648
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:43,780
rule of thirds to compose your photo or
line it up you can now pinch to zoom

649
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:51,000
right within the camera and if you hold
your finger over part of the scene now

650
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,020
we'll set the auto exposure and auto
focus lock you can even move it around

651
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,130
you know stick to that

652
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:07,860
now this is a really advanced feature
when we brought it to the iPhone and

653
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,740
we've made it really easy for everyone
to use
now next once you've taken your great

654
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:20,460
photos you can now edit them right on
your iPhone and your iPad you do things

655
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:27,390
like crop and rotate redeye reduction so
if you've taken the photo at left where

656
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:31,080
the flash has caused a redeye you can
automatically remove that redeye

657
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:36,960
right on your iPhone or iPad and we even
brought over the one-click enhance that

658
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:43,080
we pioneered in iPhoto on the Mac and it
brought that to iOS so you can see when

659
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,160
you applied one tap enhance to the right
how the color tones look so much nicer

660
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:52,740
how it pulls detail out of shadow it's
really nice so some great photo editing

661
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:57,740
features and really nice camera
enhancements

662
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:11,470
next is male now male is one of the most
used applications on both the iPhone

663
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:18,600
iPod and iPod Touch iPad and iPod Touch
and we're making it even better in iOS 5

664
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:23,410
we're adding rich text formatting so you
can set things as bold italic and

665
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:27,880
underline you can control the
indentation so you're forwarding

666
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:33,400
something you can uh ninten it's or
further indent it you can now drag the

667
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:41,230
addresses between two CC and BCC don't
have to retype them again we've added

668
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:47,500
support for flagging so you can flag and
unplug this next one has been a

669
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:52,810
incredibly popular request in addition
to searching from two and subject you

670
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:57,430
can search the entire contents of all
your messages both the messages on your

671
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:01,950
phone and all the messages back on the
mail server so search the entire

672
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:07,240
contents of your messages for the iPad
we added a really nice swipe to inbox

673
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:11,800
gesture so it makes it really nice to
use this in portrait so you swipe it on

674
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:18,610
tap on something swipe it off and with
every release of iowa's fought or is we

675
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:23,140
continue to add more support for our
enterprise customers and one example of
that in iOS 5 is we added support for

676
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:32,740
s/mime so now I think we've done a
really nice job of this so now if you

677
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:36,940
have the certificate of someone else you
automatically get this lock icon right

678
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,450
in the addressing field just to show you
this will be encrypted
when sent to the other person let me

679
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:51,760
just go ahead and give you a demo a few
of these features now alright so first I

680
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,790
can show a simple gesture I just pull on
the inbox right from there so anywhere
you are when your portrait just pull it

681
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:02,560
on you have to go hunt up and find the
right button for it you can see we're

682
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:06,640
flagging here so I can tap on that
flagged message a one other feature

683
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:12,160
we've added is a built in dictionary
throughout the OS as a service now so

684
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,940
before we had a dictionary in the iBooks
app but we now brought that

685
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:22,130
to the entire OS so all apps from the
App Store can use it so here if I press

686
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:25,819
down let's say an lychees I don't know
what that is let's say I get a defined

687
01:04:25,819 --> 01:04:37,339
addition to copy tap define there it is
built-in dictionary it's great if I say

688
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:42,680
respond to this message again I can grab
one of these addresses now just drag it

689
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:48,980
to BCC dragged it to and rearrange it
it's really nice and easy as one more

690
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,010
feature I want to show you and it's
actually a system-wide feature having do

691
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:56,450
with a keyboard when we released the
original iPhone we revolutionized the
way people would type on multi-touch

692
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,560
displays and we keep on challenging
ourselves to make that even better we

693
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:08,060
have a new variant of the keyboard in
iOS 5 for the iPad which we think people

694
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:12,470
who like to type with their thumbs while
holding it are really going to like in

695
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:16,040
the bottom right you see the keyboard
button and now it has some grab handles

696
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:26,960
if I just take those and drag it up it
splits it into two so what it does this

697
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,460
moves the keys closer to your thumbs on
the side so you can you can put it

698
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:36,079
wherever you want it's really nice and
it's persistent for every app in the

699
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,560
system it just stays where you put it we
want to put it back down just press and
hold the dock and merge it goes back

700
01:05:41,780 --> 01:06:00,010
down to the bottom so even a split
keyboard that's nail number 8 PC free

701
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:27,079
so we felt these incredible devices the
iPhone the iPad and people get them home

702
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:38,539
they open up their box and I see this I
said what now we're living in a post PC

703
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:43,640
world in fact especially with the iPad
we're offering in the post PC world we
have a lot of customers coming to us and

704
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:51,259
saying I want to buy an iPad is my only
device I don't own a computer I want to

705
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:57,199
buy an iPhone is my only device my only
actually internet access for I live will

706
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:02,059
be my iPhone we know we're selling into
a lot of places where the households

707
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:06,979
just don't have computers and they want
to buy and iOS devices their only device
and that's exactly what we're going to

708
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:14,959
support an iOS 5 now you take your
iPhone out of the box instead of seeing

709
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:19,059
this you're going to see this

710
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:30,330
you can now set up and activate your
device right on the device and you are

711
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:34,710
ready to go it's that easy
of course there's some other things we

712
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:40,880
had to do to make this possible software
updates are now over-the-air

713
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,390
so you no longer need to go and plug
into a computer just to update your
software and of course they're now Delta

714
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:04,440
updates so instead of downloading the
entire OS you just download what's

715
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,390
changed now the next thing we did is we
we looked at all of the apps in the

716
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:14,100
iPhone iPad iPod Touch and asked
ourselves what are the reasons that

717
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:18,540
people go back to a computer today and
let's add that functionality right to

718
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,609
iOS so for instance you have to go back
to a computer to create calendars or

719
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:28,710
delete calendars you can now create and
delete calendars right from iOS you saw

720
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:32,819
four photos we've added really
significant editing functionality in

721
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:37,890
there so you can crop rotate one tap
enhance redeye reduction right from

722
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:42,690
within your iOS device even in mail now
you can create mailboxes and delete
mailboxes right from iOS so we looked at

723
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:52,109
all of the apps in the I phone and the
iPad added that functionality so now if

724
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:55,819
you want to cut the cord you can

725
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:11,379
next is gamecenter iOS is the most
popular gaming platform on the planet

726
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:15,770
there are more than a hundred thousand
game and entertainment titles in the App

727
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:21,049
Store and so about nine months ago we
launched Game Center and we did it to
make it even easier for people to find

728
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,740
players to play games against and also
to make it easy for you to compare how

729
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:35,330
you're doing against your friends well
in just nine months we have 50 million

730
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:43,609
Game Center users now to put that into
perspective Xbox Live has been around

731
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:52,190
for about eight years and they have
around 30 million users so Game Center
is very popular and we're making it even

732
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,080
better in iOS 5 to make it more fun and
social we're adding photos so you can

733
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,520
see photos of your friends change your
photos you can now compare yourself

734
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:09,140
against your friends using achievement
points per game you can see friends of

735
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:17,150
friends as well you also will get
recommended friends that might be great
people to play some of the games that

736
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:23,480
you like we've also added game
recommendations so there might be some

737
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:27,080
really great games out there maybe
they're new that you don't know about

738
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:32,270
and will help you discover those once
you've discovered a game you like you

739
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,950
can purchase and download it directly
from Game Center now this is great both
for our customers and for our developers

740
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:43,490
another thing we've done for our
developers is we've added support for
turn-based games right in to the OS

741
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:54,810
there are some great turn-based games
out there like Scrabble but the

742
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:58,980
developer had to do all the work for
that and now that's supported right out
of the box in iOS 5 so some really nice

743
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:16,860
enhancements to Game Center next is
iMessage now I believe we have the best

744
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:22,920
messaging client out there on the iPhone
it works tremendously well to send text

745
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:30,860
messages and photos and videos and our
customers love it our iPhone customers

746
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:37,110
but what about our iPad customers and
our iPod Touch customers they've been

747
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:42,449
asking us for a messaging solution and
so in iOS 5 we're launching a new

748
01:11:42,449 --> 01:11:47,600
messaging service between all iOS 5
customers

749
01:11:52,979 --> 01:12:01,349
and we call it iMessage so I message
supports the iPhone the iPad and the

750
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:05,780
iPod touch it does everything you've
come to expect from our messaging app on

751
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:13,320
the iPhone so you can send text messages
photos videos send contacts do group

752
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:18,119
messaging everything you come to expect
and we've added some really nice new

753
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:22,499
features things like delivery receipts
so you can see if it's been delivered to

754
01:12:22,499 --> 01:12:27,059
the other person's device optional read
receipts so you can see if it's been

755
01:12:27,059 --> 01:12:32,610
read this is why I favor a typing
indication so you can tell now if
someone starts typing and they're

756
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:38,789
responding to you you know you're about
to get that message I messages are

757
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:44,130
pushed to all your devices so if you
start a conversation on your iPad and

758
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:49,050
later pick up your iPhone you can pick
up right where you left off with all the

759
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:59,900
context of that conversation to date is
supported over both 3G and Wi-Fi and
everything is sent encrypted over the

760
01:13:02,789 --> 01:13:08,729
where over the over the air and I like
to just give you a demo of iMessage now

761
01:13:08,729 --> 01:13:13,199
to do so I also like to invite up jaws
vice president of product marketing to
help me hey da Scott thanks for having

762
01:13:17,909 --> 01:13:20,219
me
absolutely we don't mind on the play

763
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:24,780
game though playing the game okay try
not the bottom right here frolic

764
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:32,039
marketing so he's on the iPhone on the
Left I'm on my iPad on the right hand

765
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:37,320
side I go ahead and launch messages here
so here I have a conversation go with

766
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,590
jaws normally we don't stand next to
each other we have these conversations

767
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:45,539
so most I've talked to you all week
let's grab lunch after the show no okay

768
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:50,999
so when I send this to them you'll
notice as he plays the game it comes in

769
01:13:50,999 --> 01:13:55,199
right at the top and you can keep on
playing the game so it's not

770
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:02,179
interrupting him does his lovely job
playing I'm on a roll don't bother man

771
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:09,990
but at anytime he can get right back to
that message Oh at any time I think this
might be good time so it just by pulling

772
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:22,920
down town that takes him right to this
now as he starts typing see on my side

773
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,920
where there's the three dots of the
balloon that lets me know he's currently

774
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:32,910
responding well check maybe some other
messages while he's doing so so then

775
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:36,630
when he sends the message you see where
it says he gets a little delivered it

776
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:41,490
already knows it's been delivered right
to my device and when I tap on his

777
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:47,190
message it sends a read receipt saying
rad 11:15 a.m. he knows I've read it so

778
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:50,300
read restates three

779
01:14:54,740 --> 01:15:00,360
we can also send high-quality photos and
videos let me go ahead and choose a

780
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:06,220
photo here alright maybe we have a
picnic by the bridge that's so sweet

782
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:15,570
tell from the dots and his side that I'm
composing it right now send it off and
again we go over Wi-Fi as well as 3G

783
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:24,840
sends it over again he gets it nice high
quality and the entire transmission is

784
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:30,990
encrypted over-the-air and again I'm on
my iPad so it supports iPad iPod Touch

this on the push notification system

787
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:54,090
we've built so we know how to scale this
we have incredible features here in iOS

788
01:15:54,090 --> 01:16:00,150

other things like airplay mirroring you

793
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:32,760
can now mirror your entire iPad to write
to your television wirelessly using

794
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,360
Apple TV

795
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,990
Wi-Fi sync to iTunes before you had

796
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,130
exactly before before you had to go back
and plug into your computer to sync and

797
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:58,200
now when you are charging at night let's
say your iOS device will automatically

798
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,150
find iTunes over Wi-Fi and sync with it
and before it sinks it'll back itself up

799
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:12,150
so you automatically get backed up every
single day there's also some really nice

800
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:16,560
new multitasking gestures so you can
just flick right between your apps it's

801
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,010
really nice we're not only is there's
something for every one of our customers

802
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:25,380
there's something for every one of our
developers some great new development

803
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:30,650
tools including significant enhancements
to xcode instruments in the simulator
even core image we brought over the

804
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:40,980
powerful core image framework from Mac
OS 10 to iOS this allows developers to
do complex image operations like redeye

805
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:48,330
reduction face detection right from
within their apps so you're asking
yourself when are you getting it and the

806
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:57,500
answer is we are giving a developer seed
to you today

807
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,480
this is going to be great for the
conference as you learn about all the

808
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,380
new api's than all the sessions this
week you can go and use those api's

809
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:19,190
immediately using your seed and iOS five
will ship to all of our customers this
fall

810
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:25,370
iOS 5 will support the same devices that
we supported with our last software

811
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:31,310
update so that's the iPhone 3GS and
iPhone 4 all the iPads iPad and iPad 2

812
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:40,660
and the third and fourth generation iPod
Touch and that is iOS 5

813
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:55,420
and that is the second of the software
products we want to tell you about today

814
01:18:55,420 --> 01:19:00,030
to tell you about the third I like to
turn it back over to Steve

815
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:19,570
so you like everything so far well I'll
try not to blow it so I get to talk

816
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:24,340
about iCloud we've been working on this
for some time now and we're really

817
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:31,810
excited about it about ten years ago we
had one of our most important insights

818
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:39,760
and that was that the PC was going to
become the digital hub for your digital

819
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,800
life what does that mean well it meant
that that's where you were going to put

820
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,780
your digital photos where else were you
going to put them your digital video off

821
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:54,790
your digital camcorder and of course
your music right you were going to

822
01:19:54,790 --> 01:20:00,760
acquire it in the device or potentially
on your Mac and you were going to

823
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:06,070
basically sync it to the Mac and
everything was going to work fine and it
did for the better part of 10 years but

824
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:18,160
it's broken down in the last few years
why well because the devices have
changed they now all have music they now

825
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:29,980
all have photos they now all have video
and so if I acquire a song I buy it

826
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:36,219
right on my iPhone I want to get that to
my other devices right I pick up my iPad

827
01:20:36,219 --> 01:20:41,949
it doesn't have that song on it so I
have to sync my iphone to my Mac then I

828
01:20:41,949 --> 01:20:45,640
have to sync my other devices to the Mac
to get that song but then they've

829
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,810
deposited some photos on the Mac so I
have to sync the iPhone again with the

830
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:54,760
Mac to get those photos and keeping
these devices in sync is driving us

831
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,850
crazy

832
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:05,110
so we got a great solution for this
problem

833
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:10,270
and we think this solution is our next
big insight which is we're going to

834
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:18,100
demote the PC in the Mac to just be a
device just like an iPhone an iPad or

835
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:23,530
iPod touch and we're going to move the
digital hub the center of your digital
life into the cloud because all these

836
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:32,170
new devices have communications built
into them they can all talk to the cloud

837
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:40,600
whenever they want and so now if I get
something on my iPhone it sent up to the

838
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,510
cloud immediately let's say I take some
pictures with it

839
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:49,200
those pictures are in the cloud and they
are now pushed down to my devices

840
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:54,910
completely automatically and now
everything is in sync with me not even

841
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,900
having to think about it I don't even
have to take the devices out of my

842
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:07,030
pocket I don't have to be near my Mac or
PC now some people think the cloud is

843
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:14,080
just a hard disk in the sky right and
you take a bunch of stuff and you put it

844
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,610
in your Dropbox or your I disk or
whatever and it transfers it up to the

845
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:22,060
cloud and stores and then you drag
whatever you want back out on your other

846
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:30,490
devices we think it's way more than that
and we call it iCloud now iCloud stores
your content in the cloud and wirelessly

847
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:40,990
pushes it to all your devices so it
automatically uploads it stores it and
automatically pushes it to all your

848
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:50,020
other devices but also it's completely
integrated with your apps and so

849
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:58,440
everything happens automatically and
there's nothing new to learn it just all
works it just works

850
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:13,130
now you might ask why should I believe
them they're the ones that brought me

851
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:27,700
MobileMe it wasn't our finest hour let
me just say that but we learned a lot

852
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:35,390
now the three core apps in MobileMe were
contacts calendar and mail three things

853
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:42,260
we'd obviously like kept up to date
we've thrown them away we've reacted and

854
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:48,260
rewritten them from the ground up to be
iCloud apps and we've put them on all of

855
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:56,810
our devices so as an example in contacts
when I make a new contact on my iPhone

856
01:23:56,810 --> 01:24:00,610
it's automatically brought up to the
cloud where it's stored on the cloud
right the truth is on the cloud and then

857
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,090
it's automatically pushed down to my
other devices so they're all in sync

858
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:13,100
it's that easy
I just update a contact on my iPhone and

859
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:17,600
don't even think about it and that
contact is updated on all my other

860
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:23,300
devices and if I change it on any device
it's updated on all devices wirelessly

861
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:29,440
automatically without me doing a thing
so that's contacts here's calendars
works much the same way I make a new

862
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:38,450
calendar event for my iPhone it's stored
in the cloud and it's pushed to my other

863
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:45,590
devices pretty cool
we've also added calendar sharing so as

864
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:51,080
an example if I'm sharing a few
calendars with my wife school and soccer

865
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:57,710
calendars let's say right and I add a
new calendar for a teacher parent

866
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:06,250
conference on my phone it's again
automatically pushed up to the cloud and

867
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:11,449
automatically push to my wife's iPhone
if she adds
the key adds an appointment for a soccer

868
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:21,860
game again goes up to the cloud and back
to my iPhone it's that simple

869
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:29,570
and so calendars has it stores your
calendars in the cloud changes on any

870
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:34,460
device or push to all your devices and
we have shared calendars we think you're

871
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:41,929
going to love the new calendars it just
works and then we have mail mail was in

872
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:47,060
the best shape of all but it's even
better now we give you a mail account it

873
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:53,150
at me calm your new messages again are
pushed to all your devices and like we
use through your inbox and folders are

874
01:25:55,040 --> 01:26:03,400
all kept up to date on all devices
so that's mail and no ads

875
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:14,500
we build products that we want for
ourselves too and we just don't want to

876
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:20,980
ads so we can't get there so these are
the three apps that form the core of

877
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:28,420
mobile me we used to sell them for a
subscription price of $99 annually as of

878
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:36,720
today this product ceases to exist and
those three apps are out of the food

879
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:55,660
but we didn't stop there we've got three
more apps that we've brought into the
iCloud universe the first is of course

880
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:09,580
the App Store the App Store you've
bought a lot of apps so far and you can

881
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:12,060
buy them of course directly on your
devices

882
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:17,260
maybe the app you want isn't on the
device you've got with you so for all

883
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:23,350
your purchase history now you can see it
on all your devices even if the apps not

884
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:32,260
there and we've added this button here
which is download from the cloud and if

885
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:36,250
you want that app on that device you
just push that button and that app is

886
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:41,220
automatically sent to that device right
and there's no extra charge

887
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:47,290
no extra charge now we've done that for
your purchase history what about four

888
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:51,640
devices you buy in the future well four
devices when you buy them in the future

889
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:58,960
you want to buy Yelp let's say the cloud
downloads it to all your devices again

890
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,450
at no extra charge all automatically

891
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:12,890
so that's what we're doing with the App
Store iBooks same thing you've got your

892
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:17,090
purchase history of all the books you've
bought on any device you want to get it

893
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:22,460
on your iPhone se just push the button
it downloads to that device when you buy

894
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:29,270
a new iBook let's say you want to buy
this book here the wave it downloads it

895
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:36,500
to all your devices now and if you're
reading it on one device let's say

896
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:42,320
you're reading it on your iPad and
you've just got to run you get to a page

897
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,250
you bookmark that page that bookmark is
sent up to the cloud and stored and

898
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:50,930
again push to all your other devices so
maybe you can read another the rest of

899
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:57,130
the chapter as an example on the train
to work it all just works

900
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:07,920
and now back up we talked about being PC
free Scott talked about how you can

901
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:15,840
wirelessly backup your devices daily to
your PC or your Mac but let's do it to

902
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,370
the cloud as well for those people that
want to be completely PC free so we've

903
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:29,430
added wireless backup to the cloud and
basically once daily we're going to

904
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:34,950
backup a lot of your important contents
to the cloud if you ever get a new phone
and have to replace a phone you

905
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:40,950
literally type in your Apple ID and
password and everything will be loaded

906
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:44,840
onto that phone automatically in wires

907
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:57,300
so we automatically do daily backups to
iCloud over Wi-Fi

908
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:04,300
we backup your purchased music apps and
books we backup your camera roll with

909
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:10,270
your photos and videos we backup your
device settings and we backup your app

910
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:24,070
data all to the cloud so that is backup
and those are three other apps that come
with iCloud but we couldn't stop there

911
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:35,530
and so we have a final three apps that
are amazing
the most inventive part of iCloud I

912
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:52,530
think and I'd love to tell you about the
first one is documents in the cloud so

913
01:30:53,790 --> 01:31:02,590
if I'm on my iPad and I create a Pages
document right I create a Pages document

914
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:09,850
and it automatically uploads it and
stores it in the cloud when I close that

915
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:15,310
document completely automatically and it
then pushes it to all the devices that I

916
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:25,840
have pages on so I can get the document
between my devices and we have put that

917
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:32,710
into Pages Numbers and Keynote as a
matter of fact the versions we just

918
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:40,060
released last week have this in there
and to demonstrate what this is like

919
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:45,730
with I work I'd love to invite Roger
Rosner who's our VP of I work up to give
us a quick demo

920
01:31:49,229 --> 01:31:57,539
thank you Steve alright let's take a
look at how I work and iCloud will work
together let's say you're working on a

921
01:31:59,849 --> 01:32:04,530
keynote presentation on your iPad making
a beautiful presentation with all those

922
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:09,599
awesome keynote graphic effects and
animations but you're away from home you

923
01:32:09,599 --> 01:32:14,219
didn't bring your iPad with you and you
run into somebody who wants to see your

924
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:19,679
presentation well the good news is last
week we shipped I work for iPhone and

925
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:24,690
even better for anybody who bought and
iWork app for your iPad you can download
that app for your iPhone at no

926
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:31,380
additional charge so let's fire up
keynote on this phone this is the first

927
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:35,849
time we've run it here so it's going to
say hi then it's going to say do you

928
01:32:35,849 --> 01:32:41,369
want to use iCloud we say yes and
immediately it sees all your keynote
presentations that you've been working

929
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:47,519
on in the cloud and starts to download
them in the background to your iPhone so

930
01:32:47,519 --> 01:32:51,989
I'll open this one we were just looking
at and as you can see it's all there and
even remembered what slide we were

931
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:59,929
looking at and if I want to I can just
hit play play it right on my iPhone and

932
01:32:59,929 --> 01:33:07,550
I put exactly zero effort into getting
that file over here pretty neat

933
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:19,460
of course all the iWork apps use iCloud
so let's take a look at pages and you

934
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,550
know imagine you're out and you you're
inspired to make some changes to a

935
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:28,300
document you've been working on so I'm
going to move this graphic over here

936
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:32,210
maybe I just took a photograph that I
think would be great to spruce up my

937
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:38,000
cover page so I'll go to my camera roll
I'd serve my graphic use alignment

938
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,340
guides to place it and I'm done and I
stick the phone in my pocket and I

939
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:48,500
forget about it and in the background
iCloud is grabbing all those changes and

940
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:54,110
then immediately pushing them back down
to my iPad so when I get home pick up

941
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:58,340
the iPad fire up pages you can see in
the upper left my document thumbnails

942
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:01,030
already been updated

943
01:34:06,579 --> 01:34:13,280
and there are all my edits absolutely no
effort on my part and that is how I work

944
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,739
works with iCloud I think you're going
to like it

945
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:31,909
thank you thanks Roger
and documents in the cloud really

946
01:34:31,909 --> 01:34:40,400
completes our iOS document storage story
- in other words a lot of us have been

947
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:47,150
working for 10 years to get rid of the
file system so the user didn't have to

948
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:52,429
worry about it when you try to teach
teach somebody how to use a Mac the

949
01:34:52,429 --> 01:34:56,690
easiest of all computers to use
everything's going along fine until you
hit the file system and then difficulty

950
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:05,659
is staggering for most people so we've
made it on the iOS devices to where you

951
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:09,860
don't ever have to think about it the
app manages the presentation of its own

952
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:15,679
documents just like mail manages the
presentation of its own messages but the

953
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:21,380
piece that we weren't finished with was
how do we move those documents around to

954
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:28,579
different devices and documents in the
cloud solves that problem for us apps

955
01:35:28,579 --> 01:35:34,639
can store documents in iCloud iCloud
pushes those documents to a user's

956
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:39,409
devices automatically
the documents update on all devices when
changed on any device and we are

957
01:35:44,389 --> 01:35:49,450
releasing
[Applause]

958
01:35:54,750 --> 01:36:03,070
it's really easy to tie your apps into
iCloud's storage system and again you

959
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:07,900
can have complex documents apps like
pages or we've got another storage

960
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:13,630
facility for key value data so as an
example if you've got an app that just

961
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:18,190
track stocks you can just update the key
value pairs and we'll store that in the
cloud as well so documents and key value

962
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:30,750
data works across all iOS devices and
Macs and PCs to

963
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:44,080
so we think this is going to be pretty
big and that is documents in the cloud

964
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:55,430
this next one is maybe my favorite one
and it's called Photo Stream and it's

965
01:36:55,430 --> 01:37:02,240
going to bring the cloud to photos how
many times have we taken photos on our
iPhone maybe of our kids in the

966
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:10,490
afternoon and wanted when we got home to
share them on an iPad and have to go

967
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:14,690
through the process of moving them over
wouldn't it be great if by the time I

968
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:19,670
got home they were already there on the
iPad well that's what Photo Stream is

969
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:25,460
going to do for us across all of our
devices so again I take photos on any

970
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:32,240
device puts it in the camera roll and
that will be automatically uploaded to

971
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:38,120
the cloud where it's stored and
automatically downloaded to all my other

972
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:46,220
devices including in this case a Mac and
so I've got my photos on my iPad just

973
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:54,320
waiting for me when I get home now in
addition I can import photos right into
iPhoto as an example on the Mac it'll

974
01:37:57,710 --> 01:38:02,030
upload those to the cloud and do exactly
the same thing with them by pushing them

975
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:05,810
down to all my other devices so it's
apps that I its photos that I take or

976
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:13,070
photos that I import and we built this
right into the apps I hope you've seen
that as we've gone through this we've

977
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,840
built this right into the app so there's
nothing new to learn

978
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:23,330
so photo stream on the iPads photo app
we've built it right in right next to

979
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:27,680
albums we have a button called Photo
Stream you push it and you're looking at

980
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:32,240
the photo stream it's that simple
there's not a separate app that you have
to go learn it's right there in your

981
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:39,500
Photos app it's right there in your
Photos app on your iPhone it's just

982
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:43,130
right there with all your other albums
there you go

983
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:45,790
Photo Stream

984
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:55,350
on the map on the map we built it right
into iPhoto and so it's right there on

985
01:38:55,350 --> 01:39:03,440
the side your photo stream and on a PC
they don't have a Photos app so we use
the pictures folder right in addition to

986
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:21,870
that we even built it in to Apple TV so
Apple TV Apple TV talks directly over
the internet directly to the photo

987
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:29,700
stream servers doesn't even go through
your PC talks directly the photo stream

988
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:39,990
servers so you can watch the photos
right on your Apple TV so one of the

989
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:44,910
problems we faced was it will photos are
large and will use up all the memory on

990
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:50,310
your devices there are also large
they'll consume vast amounts of storage

991
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:55,740
in our server farms so we've came up
with a great scheme we're going to store
photos on your devices we're going to

992
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:04,680
store the last thousand photos right
let's store the last thousand and any

993
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:08,550
photos you want to keep permanently just
move them into an album and they'll stay

994
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:15,030
forever but they'll be parading by you
the last thousand photographs on your

995
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:19,560
Mac or PC because we have more storage
will store all of them you can get rid

996
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:24,510
of them by just deleting them but we'll
store all of them and on the server will

997
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:28,170
store them for 30 days which is more
than enough time for all your devices to

998
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:33,930
connect and automatically download those
photos so we think we've got a great

999
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:38,730
system here that's going to move our
photos around among all of our devices
even Apple TV so that when I take a

1000
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:47,730
photo anywhere I can view it on all my
other devices we think this is going to

1001
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:52,170
be really exciting to demonstrate this
I've asked Eddy Cue or VP of Internet

1002
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:56,750
services to come out and give us a demo
of photo stream

1003
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,550
thank you yep

1004
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:04,810
so I want to take some photos to start
with now I love cars and I happen to

1005
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:09,990
have brought one of my favorite ones
with me here today and here it is and
we're going to go to our my iPhone and

1006
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:21,400
launch the camera app Lightning McQueen
is looking good
I love the headlights and now these

1007
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:40,870
photos are on my iPhone but let's go
look at my iPad now we've built Photo

1008
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:45,040
Stream right into the Photos app so
right next to albums this photo stream

1009
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:49,740
and there is the pictures I just

1010
01:41:55,619 --> 01:41:59,729
I didn't have to learn anything new at
all and if I want to save them

1011
01:41:59,729 --> 01:42:05,820
permanently on my iPad I can just select
them and move them to an existing album
or even create a new album that's it

1012
01:42:11,899 --> 01:42:17,309
now these photos aren't just on my iPad
they're on all of my devices let's move

1013
01:42:17,309 --> 01:42:22,379
over to the Mac where I've got iPhoto
running and we've built again Photo

1014
01:42:22,379 --> 01:42:37,979
Stream right in and there are the photos
I just took so now when I take a photo

1015
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:42,929
on one of my devices they automatically
appear on all of my devices without

1016
01:42:42,929 --> 01:42:45,689
having to do anything at all it's that
simple

1017
01:42:45,689 --> 01:42:48,949
and that's Photo Stream

1018
01:42:53,570 --> 01:43:01,810
okay okay not awesome

1019
01:43:03,099 --> 01:43:12,230
so photos you tape or import upload to
iCloud iCloud pushes them to all your
devices works over Wi-Fi its iCloud

1020
01:43:18,829 --> 01:43:23,000
stores each photo for 30 days which is
plenty enough time for all the devices

1021
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,520
to be connected devices store the last
thousand photos and again you can just

1022
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:35,630
drag them to an album they stay forever
and Macs and PCs store all photos so

1023
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:39,920
we're really really pleased with Photo
Stream we think you're going to like it

1024
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:50,320
a lot last but not least is iTunes in
the cloud

1025
01:43:55,099 --> 01:44:06,239
you know it's the same old story right
about I buy something on my iPhone right
wolf and and it's not on my other

1026
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:11,250
devices
I grab my ipod and I go to listen to

1027
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:15,810
that song I bought yesterday my iPhone
it ain't there well the first thing

1028
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:21,420
we've done again is for the songs you've
already bought we've added a purchase

1029
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:28,050
button that shows you your entire
purchase history of all the iTunes songs

1030
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:33,690
you bought on any device you can look at
it by all songs or recent songs or you
can look at it by artist so I'm going to

1031
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,710
pick Bob Dylan here and I can download
any of these albums that I've bought on

1032
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:46,920
iTunes to this device just by pushing
that cloud download button or I could go

1033
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:53,460
in to one of them and just download
whatever songs I want to this device so

1034
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:58,710
anything I bought I can now download to
any of my devices at no additional

1035
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:03,110
charge which is

1036
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:12,590
this is the first time we've seen this
in the music industry no charge for

1037
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:19,280
multiple downloads two different devices
and for the future I flick one switch to

1038
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:28,580
on and now any song I buy on any device
again will automatically be downloaded

1039
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:34,790
to all my devices so when I want to buy
a song in this case in a Dell song it

1040
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:41,660
will push it to all of my devices so to
give us a demo of that again I'd like to

1041
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:56,000
invite idiot thank you thanks Steve so
I'm on my iphone and I want to listen to

1042
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,510
a song I'd previously purchased on
iTunes but it's not in the music library

1043
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:03,580
on this device well now I can easily
just go to the iTunes Music Store

1044
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:08,900
there's a new purchase tab right on the
bottom and now I'm seeing all of the

1045
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:16,310
purchases I've ever done on iTunes I can
even look at them the songs that I had

1046
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:19,550
that are not on this device that I
previously purchased by just tapping

1047
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:23,420
that button now I'm going to look for a
Foo Fighters song I think it's called

1048
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,720
the walk

1049
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:39,300
and there it is and what just tapping
the iCloud button it downloads to my

1050
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:43,350
iPhone again because I'd previously
purchased this song it's downloading at

1051
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:48,140
no additional cost let's go ahead and
play it

1052
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:57,620
just finishing downloading

1053
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:10,999
now that's great but I think's in the
cloud is even better let's see what

1054
01:47:10,999 --> 01:47:15,380
happens when I purchase a new song and
if we can bring up my iPad I'm going to

1055
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:20,869
go ahead and launch our new music player
in iOS 5 and on my iPhone I'm going to

1056
01:47:20,869 --> 01:47:26,510
go back to the iTunes store I want to
buy a new song and I want to look at the

1057
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:30,260
Bruno Mars's new album I know he has a
hit song I think it's called the lazy

1058
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:42,499
lazy song that's it
we can preview it that's definitely it

1059
01:47:42,499 --> 01:47:46,969
now I'm going to buy it but before I do
notice on my iPad I don't have any Bruno

1060
01:47:46,969 --> 01:47:54,949
Mars songs at all so we're going to go
and buy and it's now downloading to my

1061
01:47:54,949 --> 01:48:00,159
iPhone and in addition there's the Bruno
Mars song

1062
01:48:06,449 --> 01:48:17,820
and of course what so now when I buy a
song on one of my devices it

1063
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:22,050
automatically downloads to all of my
devices without having to sync or do any

1064
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:26,120
work at all and that's iTunes in the
cloud

1065
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:41,749
thank you very much is this awesome
so music purchase from iTunes high

1066
01:48:41,749 --> 01:48:48,440
quality 256 kilobits AAC and you can
have up to 10 devices downloading your

1067
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:55,400
music to all of them every time you buy
it on any device iTunes in the cloud so

1068
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:12,349
these 9 apps constitute iCloud and they
are all free we want we want every user

1069
01:49:12,349 --> 01:49:16,789
to take advantage of these and we know
if we make them free that they'll they

1070
01:49:16,789 --> 01:49:22,550
will and we want people to see what
these devices can really do and what the

1071
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:27,729
software can really do so we're making
it free and we're very excited about it

1072
01:49:27,729 --> 01:49:34,999
so that's iCloud it stores your content
and wirelessly pushes it to all your
devices and it's integrated with your

1073
01:49:38,179 --> 01:49:45,079
apps so everything happens automatically
so a competitor that doesn't own the

1074
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:50,869
apps or doesn't have great developers to
integrate with their apps they can never

1075
01:49:50,869 --> 01:49:56,840
do this they can never make it so it
just works and that's what we've done

1076
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:03,710
here so how do you get it well when you
upgrade your phone or buy a new phone

1077
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:08,749
with iOS 5 on it all you have to do is
type in your Apple ID and password and

1078
01:50:08,749 --> 01:50:15,170
that's it and you'll go to switch that's
iCloud you can turn it off if you'd like

1079
01:50:15,170 --> 01:50:20,989
it would be turned on by default and
you're up and running we're also going
to give everybody five gigabytes of free

1080
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:29,960
storage for mail documents and backup
and that's even more than it sounds like

1081
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:35,510
because we're not counting purchase
music apps or books towards that five

1082
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:37,960
gigabytes

1083
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:50,980
nor are we counting photostream
towards that five gigabytes so when can

1084
01:50:50,980 --> 01:51:03,519
you get your hands on this today we're
going to get you all a developer beta

1085
01:51:03,519 --> 01:51:09,579
today and also today we're going to make
something available to end-users which
is the iTunes in the cloud portion and

1086
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:18,909
it runs on iOS 4.3 it will run on all
the supported platforms when we ship it

1087
01:51:18,909 --> 01:51:23,590
this fall but today we're going to put
it out for 4.3 as a beta and everyone

1088
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:29,199
can get their hands on it and run it on
their existing existing iPhone 4s so we
think this is going to be really

1089
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:38,880
exciting and of course we ship iCloud
concurrent with shipping iOS 5 this fall

1090
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,530
so that is iCloud

1091
01:51:53,850 --> 01:52:05,370
now there's one more thing small thing
it pertains to iTunes in the cloud as
you recall iTunes in the cloud is just

1092
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:13,740
for the music that you've purchased from
the iTunes Store now at 14 billion songs

1093
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:17,520
15 billion excuse me that's a lot of
songs out there

1094
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:23,490
they've been purchased from iTunes Music
Store but you may have some that you
ripped yourself and there's 3 ways you

1095
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:33,000
can deal with that one
you can sync your new devices over Wi-Fi

1096
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,340
or cable cable and you only have to sync
them once just to get that music on them

1097
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:43,380
and then you can rely on iCloud to take
care of getting all your new purchases

1098
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:50,790
off iTunes onto that device or if it's
just a few songs you love you don't

1099
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:56,460
leave behind you can buy those songs
that you'll miss on iTunes we're going

1100
01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:03,840
to offer a third way which is called
iTunes Match what is iTunes Match well

1101
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:11,550
iTunes Match uses the fact that we've
got 18 million songs now in the iTunes

1102
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:16,920
music store and the chances are awfully
good that we've got the songs in our

1103
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:25,170
store that you've ripped and so we wrote
software to scan those CDs the rip scene

1104
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:33,360
on iTunes music and match it up with
those songs we have in the store right

1105
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:38,520
and so we can give that music the same
benefits as music purchase from iTunes

1106
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:44,130
and it takes just minutes not weeks if
you have to upload your whole library

1107
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:50,270
into some Lockland the sky that
literally takes weeks this takes minutes

1108
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:55,850
because we're scanning and matching your
library so we don't need to upload that

1109
01:53:55,850 --> 01:54:00,420
that large part of your library and the
few songs that remain well we'll upload

1110
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:07,700
them but with 18 million songs are most
likely to have what's your back

1111
01:54:12,670 --> 01:54:20,080
in addition iTunes Match will upgrade
those songs that match the 256 kilobits

1112
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,619
AAC

1113
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:27,370
I

1114
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:37,710
and iTunes Match cost just $24.99 a year
so if you've got a bunch of music if

1115
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:41,010
you've got a bunch of music that you
didn't buy from iTunes you can get all

1116
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:44,880
the benefits of the cloud service and
more in terms of upgrading your music

1117
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:49,950
for $24.99 a year now if you look and
compare that to some competitors let's

1118
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:55,950
just look at Apple and Amazon and Google
your kind of get surprised because again

1119
01:54:55,950 --> 01:55:00,120
the library in the cloud we scan and
match the other guys you've got to

1120
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:07,980
upload your whole music library again
it's going to take weeks music apps on

1121
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:16,320
your Mac and PC well you're stuck with a
web app instead of iTunes upgrade to 256

1122
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:21,990
kilobits per second the other guys
aren't upgrading you at all the annual

1123
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:27,870
price for 5,000 songs we're $24.99
Amazon charges you $50 for the storage

1124
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:32,880
and google hasn't announced their
pricing yet even at 20,000 songs we

1125
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:38,610
charge one flat price Amazon is up to
$200 for the storage and Google has an

1126
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:41,450
announcer present

1127
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:53,450
most of our customers won't need this
because they bought a lot of their music
on iTunes but for those that do

1128
01:55:55,070 --> 01:56:00,100
it's an industry-leading offering let's
put it that way

1129
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:06,020
so that's iTunes Match and it goes along
with free iTunes in the cloud

1130
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:20,540
and that's what it is
now if you don't think we're serious
about this you're wrong this is our

1131
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:35,870
third data center that we just completed
it's in Maidan North Carolina this is

1132
01:56:35,870 --> 01:56:40,210
what it looks like it's rather large
[Music]

1133
01:56:40,210 --> 01:56:46,480
it's as eco-friendly as you can make a
data center with modern technology and
we're pretty proud of it just to give

1134
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:54,500
you a feel for its size see those two
little dots on the roof those are two

1135
01:56:54,500 --> 01:57:02,660
people right there so it's a pretty
large place and and it's a full of stuff

1136
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:14,150
a little expensive stuff and we are
ready we think for for our customers to

1137
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:21,560
start using iCloud and we can't wait to
get it in their hands so I cloud is the

1138
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:26,540
third thing we want to talk about today
I hope you like all the three things

1139
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:31,610
that we've unveiled this morning and
again we've got a great week plan for

1142

great week and thank you very much for

1143

[Applause]

1144
01:58:05,179 --> 01:58:07,239
