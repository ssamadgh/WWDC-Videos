 Abstract:
 The base collection view cell used by the AAPLCollectionViewLayout code. This cell provides swipe to edit and drag to reorder support.
 
  This file contains properties and methods that are used for communication internally between the layout, the swipe to edit state machine and other mechanisms. Most likely, it is not necessary to access these methods and properties to use AAPLCollectionViewCell correctly.
