1
00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:25,536
>> Hello everybody.


2
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,036
My name is Cas Lemmens.


3
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,556
I'm a designer here at Apple,


4
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,696
and I'm delighted to see that so


5
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:31,616
many people have showed up to


6
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,856
talk about designing across


7
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:33,316
platforms.


8
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:35,076
It's a pretty amazing view from


9
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:35,296
here.


10
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:36,456
I wish you could see it.


11
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:40,296
Alright. At Apple, we're really


12
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:41,466
proud of the platforms that we


13
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:41,816
create.


14
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:43,286
For every platform that we've


15
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,706
created, and for every time we


16
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:47,126
update a platform, we aim to


17
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:48,246
improve your day-to-day life,


18
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:49,676
and hopefully create a


19
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:51,266
meaningful relationship between


20
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,336
the platform and you.


21
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:54,726
And that relationship doesn't


22
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:56,096
have to extend to just one


23
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:56,626
platform.


24
00:00:57,476 --> 00:00:58,826
The more Apple products you use,


25
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,376
the more you rely on not just


26
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,006
single platforms, but on the


27
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:03,306
entire ecosystem.


28
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,236
You might start your day with a


29
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:07,136
run on your Watch.


30
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,166
At work, you might be using a


31
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,326
MacBook or an iMac.


32
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:12,366
When you head home, you might


33
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,836
look up public transportation on


34
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:15,716
your phone, or use CarPlay in


35
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,176
the car.


36
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,186
When you're at home, you might


37
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:20,026
unwind watching a TV show or a


38
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:22,066
movie on the Apple TV, and at


39
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:23,336
the end of the day, you might


40
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:24,806
finish a book on your iPad.


41
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,206
Regardless of the device you're


42
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:30,936
using, you can rely on Apple's


43
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:33,036
ecosystem to recognize you, to


44
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,956
understand you, and to help you.


45
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:38,346
Creating and contributing to


46
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:39,836
this ecosystem requires a very


47
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:41,086
deep understanding of every


48
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:41,796
single platform.


49
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:44,486
As a designer at Apple, that's a


50
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:45,666
very familiar challenge.


51
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:47,526
For every app that Apple


52
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:49,336
creates, we carefully consider


53
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:50,546
on which platforms it should


54
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:52,216
live, and how it should scale


55
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:52,676
between them.


56
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:55,236
If you look at the apps that


57
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:56,646
Apple creates, you might notice


58
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,366
that some of them live on all of


59
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:01,006
our platforms, like Photos, or


60
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:01,306
Music.


61
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:04,456
Others only exist on a few, like


62
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:09,735
Notes, or Mail, or TV.


63
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:12,666
Some of our services work really


64
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,836
well if you have more than one


65
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,336
device, like ApplePay.


66
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,986
And, others work only if you


67
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:20,496
have multiple devices available


68
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:22,656
at the same time, like FaceTime.


69
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:26,526
Today we're going to talk about


70
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:28,276
a process that we use at Apple


71
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:29,686
that can help you design across


72
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,206
platforms.


73
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:32,556
The goal is to efficiently, but


74
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:34,676
purposefully, bring your apps to


75
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:35,416
more platforms.


76
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:37,426
We're going to start with


77
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:37,916
selecting.


78
00:02:38,396 --> 00:02:39,366
We're going to look at the


79
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:40,876
capabilities and the context of


80
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,376
each platform, and make our


81
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,206
decision based on that


82
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:43,796
information.


83
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:46,426
Then, we going to adapt.


84
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:47,936
We're going to look at all the


85
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,136
features and functionality we


86
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,306
want to bring to our platforms


87
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:52,046
and manage that.


88
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:54,416
Then, we conform.


89
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,176
We try to find a balance between


90
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,546
our own brand and the platform


91
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:59,146
guidelines, and to find our look


92
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,566
and feel on them.


93
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:02,386
Then, we connect.


94
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:04,096
We see what happens when you go


95
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,376
from one platform to another,


96
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:06,676
and how it can make that


97
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,056
experience seamless and


98
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:08,446
effortless.


99
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:11,586
And, lastly, if possible, we try


100
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:12,166
to extend.


101
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,456
We see what can happen when


102
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:15,736
multiple platforms become


103
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:17,336
available at the same time.


104
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,996
That's the entire process, and


105
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:22,316
hopefully, at the end of this


106
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:23,246
talk, you will have all the


107
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,406
required information and


108
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,066
knowledge that you need to make


109
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,376
your apps work amazing in


110
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,306
Apple's ecosystem.


111
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:30,826
So, let's dig right in.


112
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:31,756
Let's start with selecting.


113
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:34,776
When we talk about selecting, we


114
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:35,506
really want to answer the


115
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,376
question, "What platform do I go


116
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:37,636
to?"


117
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,746
Maybe you haven't launched your


118
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:40,826
app yet, and you're trying to


119
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:42,496
decide what your first platform


120
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:42,836
will be.


121
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,056
Or, maybe, you have launched


122
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:46,036
your app on one or two


123
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,266
platforms, and you're trying to


124
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:48,686
decide where to go next.


125
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:51,446
Two words come to mind that are


126
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:52,976
really important when we talk


127
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:54,226
about selecting a platform.


128
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,396
Context and capabilities.


129
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:58,826
Context is the time, the place,


130
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:00,256
and the environment in which


131
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,446
your platform really comes


132
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:01,746
alive.


133
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,206
And, capabilities are the unique


134
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,846
functionality that makes the


135
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:06,956
platform distinct from all the


136
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:07,366
other ones.


137
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,216
It's really important to


138
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,856
understand context, as when


139
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,436
people switch context, they


140
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:13,536
often switch platform.


141
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:15,286
I'll give you an example.


142
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:16,606
Let's say that you're working


143
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,046
behind a desk at school or in


144
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:18,505
the office.


145
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,755
That's a very focused and


146
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:22,246
stationary context that you're


147
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:22,376
in.


148
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,096
When you then leave that place,


149
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,116
and let's say you go to a bus or


150
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:27,516
a train to head home, that


151
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,806
becomes a very dynamic and


152
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:31,016
mobile platform.


153
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,456
And, mobile context, sorry.


154
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,606
That's a very big switch in


155
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:36,586
context, from being very


156
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,226
stationary and focused to being


157
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:39,366
very mobile and public.


158
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:40,986
And, that also explains why


159
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,236
people would switch device.


160
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:43,836
They go from a MacBook or an


161
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:45,836
iMac, to maybe a phone or Watch.


162
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:47,296
And, that's because a phone and


163
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,416
a Watch is better optimized for


164
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,206
that context.


165
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:52,616
Understanding capabilities is


166
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,366
equally important, as they


167
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,866
really allow you to see what


168
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,636
makes a platform unique, and how


169
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,036
your app can benefit from that


170
00:04:59,036 --> 00:04:59,576
capability.


171
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:02,696
I'll give you a few examples to


172
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:03,346
show you what I mean.


173
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,426
Let's start with the iPhone.


174
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,656
Maybe the most familiar platform


175
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,626
amongst all of us here.


176
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:11,106
If you look at the context of


177
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:13,336
the iPhone, it's always on, it's


178
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:14,656
always with you, and therefore


179
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:15,246
it's mobile.


180
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:17,406
It's a very personal and private


181
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:17,936
device.


182
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:18,956
You wouldn't easily share it


183
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,946
with other people, and it's all


184
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,156
optimized for quite short


185
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:22,836
engagements.


186
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:24,276
Often when you use the iPhone,


187
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:25,356
you maybe use it for a couple of


188
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:26,476
minutes, not more.


189
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:28,936
The capabilities support the


190
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:29,446
context.


191
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,516
Because the phone is always on


192
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:33,036
and always with you, it's very


193
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:33,806
environment aware.


194
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,256
It has a gyroscope, an


195
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:37,016
accelerometer, and all that


196
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,806
information is accessible with


197
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,266
background processes even when


198
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,266
you're not using the iPhone.


199
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:43,916
Because your phone is personal


200
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,536
and private, it's protected with


201
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:45,926
Touch ID.


202
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:47,606
And, to make those short


203
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:49,066
engagements really easy and fun,


204
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,856
you have a very detailed touch


205
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:52,966
screen.


206
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:55,076
The Watch is quite similar.


207
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,936
It's also always on and with


208
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:58,156
you.


209
00:05:58,596 --> 00:05:59,856
It's also personal and private,


210
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,256
but it's much more instant, and


211
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,596
much more optimized for very


212
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,516
short interactions.


213
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:06,666
A Watch face, for example, gives


214
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,276
you the right information just


215
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:09,756
by looking at your Watch.


216
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,856
And, notifications just show you


217
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:13,106
more just by looking long


218
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:13,306
enough.


219
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:15,996
The capabilities, again, support


220
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:18,116
it, because the Watch is so


221
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,426
personal it can track your


222
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:20,646
movement, it can track your


223
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,096
heart, even your location.


224
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,116
The haptics can tell you when


225
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,266
you should look at your Watch,


226
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,906
and the Watch faces allow you to


227
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:28,306
customize the information you


228
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,756
want to see at a glance.


229
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,436
Let's look at the iPad.


230
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:33,986
The iPad has a very mixed


231
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:34,576
context.


232
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:36,476
You can use it both at home and


233
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:36,926
on the go.


234
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:38,916
You can do very precise and


235
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,686
focused work on it, or just use


236
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:42,216
it as a lean back device, for


237
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:44,256
watching movies, TV shows, or


238
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:44,876
playing games.


239
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:46,936
And, all of those are longer


240
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,906
engagements than the phone or


241
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:51,216
the Watch.


242
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:52,686
The large screen really supports


243
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:54,756
the context, because it allows


244
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:56,006
you to do all that precise and


245
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:56,646
focused work.


246
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:58,566
The ambient light sensor allows


247
00:06:58,566 --> 00:06:59,706
you to use the iPad both in the


248
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:00,956
evening and during the day.


249
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:03,086
The high-fidelity speakers allow


250
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,696
you to create a very immersive


251
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:06,036
experience with games and


252
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,926
movies, and you have that same


253
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,366
touch screen as on the phone.


254
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:11,486
And, if you add a pencil to it,


255
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:12,456
well then it becomes a very


256
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,476
precise interaction.


257
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,966
Let's look at the MacBook.


258
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:18,576
The context of the MacBook is


259
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:19,716
always in a very professional


260
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:20,266
environment.


261
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,046
You can do very precise and


262
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,566
complex work on a MacBook which


263
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:24,356
is why it's the preferred


264
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,456
platform to design apps or to


265
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:26,956
develop them.


266
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,136
It can be used as a shared


267
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:31,056
device, but it's always personal


268
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,036
as everybody has their own


269
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:32,386
account.


270
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:34,816
And, you use the MacBook or the


271
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,486
iMac for very long engagements.


272
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,106
Most of us here would probably


273
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:39,836
be using a MacBook or an iMac


274
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,146
several hours a day.


275
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:43,806
Let's look at the capabilities.


276
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:45,656
To do all that professional


277
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,836
work, it has a very high


278
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:48,526
performance.


279
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,186
The keyboard and mouse allow you


280
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,566
to do very precise and complex


281
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:51,886
work.


282
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:53,956
Multitasking allows you to do


283
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,416
exactly what you want to do, how


284
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,086
you want to do it.


285
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,566
And, multi users allow you to


286
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,056
make the MacBook or the iMac a


287
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,666
shared device, but still very


288
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:02,096
personal.


289
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,086
And lastly, let's look at the


290
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:05,656
Apple TV.


291
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,226
The Apple TV is a shared device.


292
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:09,556
You use it together with your


293
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,506
family or your friends.


294
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:11,896
It's stationary.


295
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,286
You lock it to your TV and it


296
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:14,316
doesn't really move from that


297
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:14,866
location.


298
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:16,836
And, it's completely optimized


299
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:17,956
for a lean back experience.


300
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,176
You can Watch movies, TV shows,


301
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:20,726
or play games.


302
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:22,376
And, again, all of those are


303
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,146
longer engagements, often 30


304
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,866
minutes, to maybe a few hours.


305
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:28,866
It works really well with an HD


306
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,206
display to make the content


307
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:31,016
really come alive.


308
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,116
The remote control is light and


309
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:34,285
easy, and you can just pass it


310
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,126
around to your friends and


311
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:35,576
family.


312
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,546
Because it's stationary it's


313
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,145
very home aware, which is why it


314
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,106
works so well with HomeKit, and


315
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:42,416
it's completely optimized for a


316
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:43,966
10-foot distance, so you can


317
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:44,926
really just sit back on the


318
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,556
couch, relax, and enjoy the


319
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:46,826
show.


320
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,856
So, you see that understanding


321
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,156
the context and the capabilities


322
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,556
of each platform is really


323
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,296
important to help you choose


324
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:56,386
what platform to go to.


325
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:58,416
The context is where it comes


326
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,616
alive, and the capabilities is


327
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:01,366
what makes it unique.


328
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:03,736
And, the same goes for your app,


329
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:05,076
so you might want to ask


330
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:07,066
yourself, in what context does


331
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,346
my app really come alive?


332
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,386
And, what are the capabilities


333
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:11,606
it requires to do so?


334
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:15,026
At Apple, we have a simple


335
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:16,466
exercise we like to do a couple


336
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,586
of times when we're trying to


337
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:19,486
choose on which platforms an app


338
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:20,406
should be available on.


339
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:21,856
And, I'll give you a few


340
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:22,876
examples to show you what I


341
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:23,086
mean.


342
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,016
Let's look at Activity.


343
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:26,996
If you think about the


344
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,366
characteristics of Activity,


345
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,306
well, it has to be mobile.


346
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,026
Activity tracks your data --


347
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,836
tracks your movement the whole


348
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:35,386
day, so to give you accurate


349
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:36,926
data, it has to be always on,


350
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,406
always with you, and therefore,


351
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:38,876
mobile.


352
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:41,486
It also has to be personal.


353
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:43,096
It should be able to track your


354
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:44,586
data and only your data.


355
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:46,846
So, when you look at these two


356
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:48,226
characteristics, what we do, is


357
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:49,286
we map them out.


358
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:50,676
We try to put them on a scale.


359
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:52,656
For example, if we look at


360
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:54,776
mobile, we can map that out on a


361
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,756
scale from mobile to stationary.


362
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:58,666
If you look all of your


363
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:00,466
platforms on this scale, they


364
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,616
would lay out like this.


365
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:03,926
The Watch is the most mobile


366
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:05,756
platform we have, the TV as we


367
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,206
said before, is the most


368
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:07,726
stationary.


369
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:09,896
If you look at the other


370
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,986
characteristic, personal, we can


371
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,296
map it out on a scale from


372
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,356
personal to shared, and we get


373
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:15,956
something like this.


374
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,226
The Watch is the most personal


375
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,426
and mobile platform we have.


376
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,706
The TV is the most stationary


377
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,866
and shared.


378
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,026
When we looked at Activity, we


379
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:25,976
said, well it had to be


380
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:27,646
personal, and it had to be


381
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:28,026
mobile.


382
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,796
So on this chart, it's probably


383
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,026
located somewhere here.


384
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:34,736
And, that explains why Activity


385
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:36,396
is available on these platforms,


386
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:40,836
and not on any other.


387
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:42,026
I'll show you another example,


388
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:43,376
let's look at GarageBand.


389
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:45,636
The characteristics of


390
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:46,926
GarageBand is that you have to


391
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:48,396
be able to be really precise.


392
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,256
You want to be able to


393
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,136
manipulate sound exactly where


394
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,346
and when you want it.


395
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:56,116
And, secondly, it has to work


396
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,126
with multitasking.


397
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:58,906
You need to be able to play


398
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,456
multiple sounds at the same time


399
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:01,716
and it needs to be able to


400
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:02,986
handle all the hardware and


401
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,306
instruments that you might


402
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,346
attach to the platform.


403
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:07,836
So, again, we can map this out.


404
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:09,786
Let's look at precise.


405
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:12,346
We can map that out on a scale


406
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:14,126
from loose interactions to


407
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:15,046
precise interactions.


408
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:17,356
The platforms lay out like this.


409
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:19,546
On a MacBook with a keyboard and


410
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,056
a mouse, you can be really


411
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,576
precise, but on a Watch, it's a


412
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:25,086
very small screen and as


413
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,796
everybody has fat fingers, you


414
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:27,826
might not be able to be that


415
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:28,226
precise.


416
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,526
If you look at the other scale


417
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,456
of multitasking, we can map that


418
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:33,276
out on the scale from


419
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,886
multitasking to a single task.


420
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,256
On a MacBook, you can easily do


421
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:38,916
multiple tasks at the same time.


422
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,106
On a Watch, you can only do one


423
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:42,416
single task at a time.


424
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:45,246
If you look at GarageBand to be


425
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,366
set, it had to support


426
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,296
multitasking and it had to be


427
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:50,446
very precise, so it's located


428
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:52,046
somewhere here, and that


429
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,446
explains why it's available on


430
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,746
these three platforms, and not


431
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:56,276
on any other.


432
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,996
This is just a very simple


433
00:11:58,996 --> 00:12:00,606
example, two simple examples


434
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:02,926
actually of using these


435
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:04,166
characteristics to choose your


436
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:04,586
platform.


437
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,576
We do this exercise over and


438
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:07,746
over again with tons of


439
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:09,586
characteristics, and in the end,


440
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:11,336
we hope that we can find a few


441
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:12,856
platforms on which your app can


442
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:13,726
really come alive.


443
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:16,636
And that's exactly what


444
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:17,546
selecting is all about.


445
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:20,026
It is choosing a platform based


446
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,866
on the context it supports, and


447
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,096
the capabilities it provides,


448
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:25,386
and it's validating where your


449
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,906
app can benefit the most.


450
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:31,236
So, that was step one.


451
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:33,416
We looked at what platform we


452
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,146
wanted to go to.


453
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:36,006
Now, we're going to go and look


454
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:36,626
at adapting.


455
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,436
With adapting, we're going to


456
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:39,796
look at all the interactions,


457
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:41,206
all the features, all the


458
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,396
functionality we want to bring


459
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,096
to our app, and try to manage


460
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,826
that across the platforms that


461
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,776
we want to be available on.


462
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,136
I'll explain, again with an


463
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:49,616
example.


464
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:51,946
Let's look at Activity on the


465
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:52,226
iPhone.


466
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:54,306
Activity on the iPhone, you can


467
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,276
do a whole range of features.


468
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,916
You can look at your progress of


469
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:00,186
today, you can look at your


470
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,406
achievements, your workouts, you


471
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,316
can see how your friends are


472
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:03,716
doing.


473
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,256
And, you can manage all that


474
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:05,496
data.


475
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,116
You can add workouts, you can


476
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,016
invite friends, you can share


477
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:10,636
the achievements, you can share


478
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:11,006
progress.


479
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,146
All of that is possible on the


480
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:15,166
iPhone, and that works well if


481
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,636
you think back about the context


482
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:17,166
of the iPhone.


483
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,526
The iPhone was a very personal


484
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:20,826
device, and all these


485
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:21,846
interactions that you're doing


486
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:23,106
is with personal information,


487
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,426
and the iPhone was optimized for


488
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:26,546
quite short engagements.


489
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,066
And, all of these interactions,


490
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:29,196
they don't take very long.


491
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,346
You can do them relatively


492
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:30,716
quickly.


493
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:32,986
But, if you look at how that


494
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:35,546
scales to the Watch, we see that


495
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:37,466
actually the feature set is


496
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,226
greatly reduced.


497
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:40,716
And, again, this makes sense if


498
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:41,926
you think back about the context


499
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:42,926
of the Watch.


500
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:44,366
The Watch is still a very


501
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,116
personal device, and all these


502
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:46,986
interactions, all this


503
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,076
information is still very


504
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,856
personal, but as we said, the


505
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,466
Watch is optimized for really


506
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:53,076
short interactions, glances


507
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:53,446
almost.


508
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:55,386
So, we made sure that you can


509
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,896
look at your own progress at a


510
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,296
glance, and you can see how your


511
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,786
friends are doing at a glance.


512
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,526
So, one really big part about


513
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:03,976
adapting is seeing how you


514
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,406
manage your interactions, your


515
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:07,036
functionality across all the


516
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:07,996
platforms that you want to be


517
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:08,566
available on.


518
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,066
Another part, is looking at what


519
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,026
unique capabilities a platform


520
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,796
can provide, and how your app


521
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:15,686
can benefit from that.


522
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,036
When we looked at the Watch, we


523
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:19,446
said, well, some of the unique


524
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:21,396
capabilities of the Watch is


525
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,536
that it can track your movement,


526
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:23,786
it can track your heartbeat,


527
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,976
your location, and all of that


528
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,446
information is quite relevant


529
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:28,566
for an app like Activity.


530
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,596
So, if you look at what


531
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:32,126
additional features we brought


532
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,746
to the Watch, well, you can add


533
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,486
a workout, and you can set move


534
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:35,876
goals.


535
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:37,866
And, again, this only makes


536
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,196
sense if you look at the context


537
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,656
and the capabilities of the


538
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:41,046
Watch.


539
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,486
And that's exactly what adapting


540
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:44,916
is about.


541
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:46,866
It is prioritizing your feature,


542
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,336
your features based on the


543
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:49,376
platform's context and


544
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,106
capabilities, and it's


545
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,416
considering new features that


546
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,966
can benefit from the platform's


547
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,126
unique capabilities.


548
00:14:55,826 --> 00:15:00,126
A really good example of this,


549
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:01,056
is Photoshop.


550
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:02,566
For those of you who've used


551
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,786
Photoshop on a MacBook or an


552
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:05,296
iMac, you know that it's a


553
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:06,596
really enormous, big app.


554
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,106
There's tons of features in


555
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:08,296
there.


556
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,536
You can do so many things.


557
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:11,976
But, Adobe did a really good job


558
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:13,106
when they tried to bring all


559
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:14,746
those features to the phone.


560
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:17,126
They actually broke down the


561
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:19,226
feature set into 3 really


562
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:19,956
distinct apps.


563
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,646
All of the interactions are


564
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:22,806
optimized for quite short


565
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,506
engagements, and they're


566
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,376
embracing the unique


567
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:26,936
capabilities of a phone by, for


568
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:28,406
example, being able to take a


569
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:30,806
picture right from within the


570
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:31,846
app.


571
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:33,506
Another good example is the New


572
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:34,036
York Times.


573
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,016
If you want to read an article


574
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:37,266
in the New York Times, you can


575
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,736
do that on the phone, on the


576
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:40,376
iPad, or on their website.


577
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:42,076
But, if you look at what they've


578
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,826
done on the Watch, you can only


579
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,246
look through a series of the


580
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,226
most recent headlines, and if


581
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:48,076
you're interested in one of


582
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:49,506
them, you can flick down and you


583
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,026
can see a small summary of that


584
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:52,846
article, but if you want to read


585
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,176
the full article, well that's a


586
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:55,816
longer engagement, so it's no


587
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,316
longer optimized for the Watch.


588
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,086
And, therefore, they ask you to


589
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,866
go to the iPhone, the iPad, or


590
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:02,326
the website.


591
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:06,746
So, that was adapting.


592
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:09,236
In step one, we looked at what


593
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:10,696
platforms you wanted to go to,


594
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:11,946
and step two we looked at the


595
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,606
features, and now we're going to


596
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,956
look at the look and feel.


597
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:18,026
When people talk about look and


598
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,306
feel, they often think about the


599
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:21,306
word consistent, and that's


600
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:23,286
definitely a very important word


601
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,336
when we're talking about


602
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:25,696
bringing your app to multiple


603
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:26,176
platforms.


604
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:28,726
But, consistent doesn't mean


605
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:29,406
identical.


606
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:31,616
At Apple, we don't just copy and


607
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,316
paste all functionality and all


608
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:34,536
the visual elements from one


609
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,336
platform to another.


610
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:38,036
Being consistent is much more of


611
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:38,726
a balancing act.


612
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:40,576
You have to balance between two


613
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:41,586
types of consistency.


614
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,296
On one side, you have your brand


615
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:44,906
consistency.


616
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,106
This means that when people open


617
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,766
your app, they should recognize


618
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,466
your brand, it should feel very


619
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,076
familiar, and hopefully that


620
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,676
will build trust between the


621
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,256
person who's using your app, and


622
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:55,686
your brand.


623
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,356
On the other side, you have the


624
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,196
platform guidelines.


625
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,396
This means you'd be using


626
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,046
platform-provided standards, so


627
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,096
your app feels native.


628
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:06,826
Since these standards reoccur on


629
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,136
all the apps on that platform,


630
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,165
they will feel very


631
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:09,925
recognizable.


632
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,276
That lowers the cognitive load,


633
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,366
and that eases the learning


634
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:13,616
curve.


635
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:16,056
So, finding the balance between


636
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:17,536
these two types of consistencies


637
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,406
is really important, and maybe


638
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,185
the most difficult exercise in


639
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:21,796
this whole process.


640
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:24,976
The human interface guidelines


641
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,226
can be a really good help here.


642
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,205
They can help you understand all


643
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,516
the platform-provided standards


644
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,346
and guidelines, but it can also


645
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,026
help you understand where your


646
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:34,316
brand can really come alive


647
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:35,456
within these guidelines.


648
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:39,046
One example is the typefaces we


649
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:39,266
have.


650
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:42,136
You see that for each platform


651
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:43,636
we have a nice set of typefaces


652
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,006
that you can use, and they're


653
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:46,276
all optimized for the platform


654
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:46,586
they're on.


655
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:48,736
This doesn't mean that you have


656
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:50,046
to use San Francisco, or you


657
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:51,106
have to use this specific


658
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:53,696
typeface or style, but it gives


659
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:55,106
you a really good idea on what


660
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,536
sizes work well for each


661
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:56,956
platform.


662
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:00,106
If you take a look at the body


663
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,526
style for example, on these


664
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,406
three platforms, you'll see that


665
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:05,376
they nicely scale up, and that


666
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,356
has to do with the viewing


667
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:06,766
distance.


668
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:10,106
On a Watch, you look at a Watch


669
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:11,976
from quite close, maybe a foot


670
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:13,386
away, so it's quite small.


671
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,606
A phone is a little bit further


672
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:17,176
maybe one and a half foot, so


673
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,116
it's a tiny bit bigger.


674
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:21,116
But on a TV as we said before,


675
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,396
it was optimized for a 10-foot


676
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:24,276
distance, so we made it really


677
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:26,186
big so you can read it from that


678
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,516
distance quite comfortably.


679
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,476
Apart from the stylistic


680
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,606
features, the human interface


681
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:33,856
guidelines can also help you


682
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,506
with platform-provided standards


683
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:36,276
and functionality.


684
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:38,066
For example, alerts.


685
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:40,566
Alerts come on every single


686
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:41,426
platform that we have.


687
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,946
And, they have some common


688
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:43,366
elements.


689
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,646
They have a description, they


690
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:48,426
have one or two actions, they


691
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:50,136
obscure the content behind them.


692
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,246
But, if you look at the length


693
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:53,636
of the description, the styling


694
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:55,446
of the buttons, the tap targets,


695
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:57,106
they're all optimized for each


696
00:18:57,106 --> 00:18:57,566
platform.


697
00:18:58,396 --> 00:18:59,666
So, using an alert like this


698
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,286
will make the -- will be very


699
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:02,346
familiar to the user,


700
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,816
recognizable, and therefore easy


701
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:05,146
to use.


702
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:07,776
The same goes for navigation.


703
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,726
If I want to navigate to the


704
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:14,006
previous screen on my Watch, I


705
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,156
can just tap the top left


706
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:15,426
corner.


707
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:18,556
The same happens on the iPhone.


708
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:21,586
But, if you look at a TV, well


709
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:22,856
there is no back button on the


710
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:23,256
screen.


711
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:24,986
And, that's because the back


712
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:26,526
button is actually located on


713
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:26,956
your remote.


714
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:29,016
So, there's no need to add an


715
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,506
extra button on the screen to


716
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:35,016
navigate to, and to click.


717
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:36,466
So, that's exactly what


718
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,306
conforming is about.


719
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:40,146
It's finding the balance between


720
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,516
your brand and the platform


721
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:41,966
guidelines.


722
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:44,026
It's aligning with your brand,


723
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:44,846
so your brand feels


724
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,846
recognizable, familiar, and can


725
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:47,386
create trust.


726
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:49,576
And, it's aligning with the


727
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:50,546
platform guidelines and


728
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,116
functionality to lower the


729
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:54,166
cognitive load and to ease the


730
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:54,666
learning curve.


731
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:58,966
A really good example is


732
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:01,046
Ulysses, and I really hope I'm


733
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:01,736
pronouncing that right.


734
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:02,926
If not, I'm sorry.


735
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,346
If you use this app on the iPad,


736
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:08,246
the iPhone, or the Mac, you'll


737
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:09,266
notice a whole bunch of


738
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:10,466
platform-provided standards.


739
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,306
They're using navigation bars,


740
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:14,816
toolbars, search fields, and


741
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:15,376
split views.


742
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,116
And, where their brand is really


743
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,616
represented is in the writing


744
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:20,256
experience.


745
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,956
By allowing dedicated focus, and


746
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,336
quick formatting with markdown,


747
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,076
writing becomes an amazing


748
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:27,316
experience in this app.


749
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:29,986
I use this app very frequently


750
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,276
in my process, and in fact, this


751
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:33,726
presentation started in this


752
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:34,386
app.


753
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:35,886
Another good example is Streaks.


754
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:38,026
With Streaks, you immediately


755
00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:39,256
recognize the brand through the


756
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:41,036
color, the typography, the


757
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,546
iconography, even the


758
00:20:42,546 --> 00:20:43,936
interaction of long-holding to


759
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:44,726
complete a task.


760
00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:46,736
But, they really embraced the


761
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:48,246
platform guidelines with, for


762
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:49,486
example, doing very smart


763
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:51,326
notifications, scaling the


764
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:53,576
typography, and adapting to new


765
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:54,026
languages.


766
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,146
And a last good example, is


767
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:57,546
Tinder.


768
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,406
Again, you would recognize the


769
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:00,796
iconography, you recognize the


770
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:02,616
colors, the interaction of


771
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:03,646
swiping left and right.


772
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,016
But, again, they really aligned


773
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,036
with the platform guidelines.


774
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:09,436
The UI scales up very nicely to


775
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,136
the different platforms, and


776
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,216
their unique interaction of


777
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:13,756
swiping left and right never


778
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:14,936
interferes with platform


779
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:15,556
functionality.


780
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:19,876
OK, that was step three.


781
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,536
So, if this is the first time


782
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:24,306
you're going to launch your app


783
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,016
on your first platform, you're


784
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:26,686
pretty much done.


785
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:28,246
You selected your platform,


786
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:29,866
you've defined your features,


787
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:31,076
you've defined your look and


788
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:31,396
feel.


789
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:33,196
Now, you can start building it


790
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:34,206
and hopefully launch it on the


791
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:34,686
App Store.


792
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,716
But, if this is an app that you


793
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:38,156
want to launch on your second,


794
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:39,776
third, or next platform,


795
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,736
connecting becomes a really


796
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:43,126
important step.


797
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:47,346
When we talk about connecting,


798
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:48,966
two points in your experience


799
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:49,986
are really important.


800
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,616
You have the entry point and the


801
00:21:52,616 --> 00:21:53,116
exit point.


802
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:55,556
The entry point is when you open


803
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:56,786
the app, and you start using it.


804
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:59,116
The exit point is, hopefully


805
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,256
after a while, when you've done


806
00:22:00,256 --> 00:22:02,266
some work in the app, you close


807
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,506
it and you go do something else.


808
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:06,816
These two points are really


809
00:22:06,816 --> 00:22:08,156
important, even when you're just


810
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:09,196
using one platform.


811
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,756
Every time you open the app


812
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:13,306
again, you hope it doesn't just


813
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:14,736
give you that same opening


814
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:15,106
screen.


815
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:17,186
But, that it actually helps you


816
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,486
create the same environment you


817
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:20,146
were in the last time you had


818
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:20,786
the app open.


819
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:23,486
That is what we call recreating


820
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:23,856
state.


821
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:25,556
And, by state, we mean the


822
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:27,486
content and the information, and


823
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:28,716
the settings that you were using


824
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,036
the last time you had the app


825
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:30,356
open.


826
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:34,056
The state can take any shape or


827
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,476
form depending on what your app


828
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:35,676
does.


829
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,856
For a simple app like Weather,


830
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,696
for example, it should at least


831
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:41,416
open up on the same location or


832
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,496
city that you were looking at


833
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:43,536
the last time you had the app


834
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:43,876
open.


835
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,796
Preferably with the weather


836
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:46,706
information updated.


837
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:49,396
For a more complex app like


838
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:51,176
Notes, it would open the same


839
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:52,356
note you were working in last


840
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:54,476
time, if possible, with the same


841
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:55,466
tools selected.


842
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:59,486
And, for apps that revolve


843
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:01,216
around media for example, like


844
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:03,296
games, movies, or TV shows, you


845
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:04,806
would hope it would resume where


846
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:05,626
you last left off.


847
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:07,376
So, for example, in the game you


848
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:08,456
wouldn't have to play that game


849
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:09,636
all over again just to get to


850
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:10,356
that same point.


851
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:15,436
Remembering state becomes even


852
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,326
more important when you're


853
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,886
switching between platforms.


854
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:21,086
Being able to remember and


855
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:22,846
recreate the last used state on


856
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,986
any platform creates a very


857
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,526
effortless and delightful


858
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:27,216
experience.


859
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,416
It allows people to enjoy your


860
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,836
app in whichever context they


861
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:32,226
like, because you as an app


862
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:34,066
developer and designer, you will


863
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,316
take care of optimizing that


864
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:36,886
experience for the platform.


865
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,096
At Apple, we really try to


866
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,406
embrace connecting platforms.


867
00:23:42,306 --> 00:23:44,546
For example, in TV, the state


868
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:46,916
the TV app remembers is where


869
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,016
you last stopped watching.


870
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,486
The TV show you were watching


871
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:51,776
and the time you paused is


872
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:53,156
synced across all the devices,


873
00:23:53,616 --> 00:23:54,786
so you can resume on any


874
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:56,116
platform of your choosing.


875
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,166
Another good example is Maps.


876
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:01,046
This morning I looked up on my


877
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,476
MacBook how to get to this


878
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:03,186
convention center.


879
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:05,626
Because I did that, that search


880
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:06,796
went into my recent searches.


881
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:09,296
And, recent searches is a state


882
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:10,416
that's being recreated on all


883
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:10,866
platforms.


884
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,316
So when I step into my car, that


885
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:14,406
recent search popped up in the


886
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:16,016
list, I can just tap it and get


887
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:16,316
going.


888
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,696
This all works really well if


889
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:23,056
you have your apps set up on all


890
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:24,186
your platforms, and you're good


891
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:24,516
to go.


892
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:26,816
But what happens when a new


893
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:27,566
platform comes in?


894
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:29,736
Let's say that you're using a


895
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,626
MacBook and a phone, and


896
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:33,096
suddenly you buy an iPad, and it


897
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:33,966
becomes a part of your


898
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:34,576
day-to-day life.


899
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,066
Well, you install the app on the


900
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:38,586
iPad, and most of the time


901
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:40,526
before the app can actually


902
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:41,706
recreate the state you were in,


903
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,386
it needs a bit more information.


904
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:45,066
There's an additional step


905
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,066
that's required, which is a


906
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:46,626
set-up step.


907
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:48,966
The app needs to know who you


908
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,216
are, so it can recreate the


909
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:51,696
state you were in, the last time


910
00:24:51,696 --> 00:24:53,186
you had the app open on another


911
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:53,676
platform.


912
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:56,296
And, often, such a set-up step


913
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:57,386
looks something like this.


914
00:24:58,176 --> 00:24:59,236
And, this can be quite


915
00:24:59,236 --> 00:24:59,626
off-putting.


916
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,516
You have to remember your email


917
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:02,686
address, your user name, your


918
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,356
password, you have to type it


919
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:05,736
in, you might type it in wrong.


920
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:07,476
In the end, it might be so


921
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:09,076
off-putting that you actually


922
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,026
skip this and you don't want to


923
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:10,926
use this app on your new


924
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:11,396
platform.


925
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,806
But, luckily with features like


926
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:15,756
iCloud Keychain, you can just


927
00:25:15,756 --> 00:25:17,036
make this step really effortless


928
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:17,526
and easy.


929
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,486
With the tap of a button, iCloud


930
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,976
Keychain can fill in your user


931
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:22,626
name, your email, and your


932
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:24,156
password, and you're just good


933
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:24,466
to go.


934
00:25:26,216 --> 00:25:28,226
At Apple, we really embrace this


935
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:29,826
part as well, this set-up step,


936
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,556
especially with new platforms.


937
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:34,056
If you buy an Apple TV, you


938
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:34,836
don't have to set it up


939
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:37,166
manually, you can just hold your


940
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,516
iPhone or your iPad close to the


941
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:40,496
Apple TV, and it will move over


942
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,996
all the apps that are compatible


943
00:25:41,996 --> 00:25:43,956
with Apple TV as well as your


944
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,076
iTunes store credentials.


945
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:47,796
So when the Apple TV has done


946
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:49,226
setting up, you will recognize


947
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,326
all the apps that are on there,


948
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:51,326
because you also have them on


949
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,736
your phone, and you can


950
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:54,066
immediately start buying TV


951
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,446
shows, movies, or games, because


952
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:58,356
the iTunes store credentials are


953
00:25:58,436 --> 00:25:59,166
there as well.


954
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,616
So, those are really good


955
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:03,086
examples of connecting.


956
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:05,436
Connecting is creating a


957
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:06,686
continuous experience between


958
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:08,476
platforms, by remembering the


959
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:09,856
state, and optimizing for the


960
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:11,106
entry and exit point.


961
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,256
And, it's allowing for a quick


962
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:14,836
and easy way to use this new


963
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:15,306
platform.


964
00:26:15,886 --> 00:26:20,366
A really good example is Things.


965
00:26:21,216 --> 00:26:21,936
The state that they're


966
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,516
recreating is your to-do list.


967
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:25,866
On any platform that you access


968
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:27,886
Things on, you can add a to-do


969
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,366
item, you can mark one as done,


970
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:30,736
you can add a due date or


971
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,536
organize it, and it will just


972
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:33,846
sync that information across all


973
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:35,606
your devices simultaneously.


974
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:39,166
Deliveries does a very similar


975
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:39,446
thing.


976
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:43,306
It remembers a list of tracking


977
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:44,476
numbers that you've saved in


978
00:26:44,526 --> 00:26:46,396
iCloud, and it will update the


979
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,956
information from the delivery


980
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:49,806
service for each single item.


981
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,336
And, that information is


982
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:53,006
accessible on any platform you


983
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:53,676
open it up on.


984
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,486
And, a really good example of a


985
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:57,996
seamless login experience is


986
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:58,496
Instagram.


987
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:00,566
If you install Instagram, and


988
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:01,716
you have Facebook installed, it


989
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,116
will just use those credentials


990
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,206
to get you logged in to


991
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:05,726
Instagram.


992
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,056
So, with a simple tap of a


993
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,886
button, Instagram is opened up


994
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:09,976
for you, and you're good to go.


995
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:15,716
So, that was connecting.


996
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:17,716
We looked at what happens when


997
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:18,906
you go from one platform to


998
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:19,246
another.


999
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:22,146
In step five, we actually look


1000
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:23,346
at what happens when two


1001
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:25,376
platforms are available at the


1002
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:25,926
same time.


1003
00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:28,846
And, to do that, I'm going to go


1004
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,236
back to what we talked about in


1005
00:27:30,236 --> 00:27:32,296
step one, in selecting, to the


1006
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:33,906
context and the capabilities of


1007
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:34,486
the platforms.


1008
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:37,486
Let's look at the MacBook again.


1009
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:39,466
We said, well, it had a very


1010
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:41,066
high performance, you could do


1011
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,116
really precise work with the


1012
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:43,506
keyboard and mouse, it could do


1013
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:45,456
multitasking, but maybe what


1014
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:46,886
it's not really good at, is


1015
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:48,506
exactly knowing who you are.


1016
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,206
In fact, when I open up my


1017
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:53,136
MacBook from sleep or I start it


1018
00:27:53,136 --> 00:27:55,946
up from when it's off, I get


1019
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:56,496
something like this.


1020
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,956
I have to type in my password or


1021
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,306
I have to give my Touch ID to


1022
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:00,826
login.


1023
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,076
And, again, just like the login


1024
00:28:03,076 --> 00:28:04,826
experience before, if I need to


1025
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:06,496
type in my password, that could


1026
00:28:06,496 --> 00:28:07,266
be quite off-putting.


1027
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:09,346
I have to remember it, I might


1028
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:11,046
type it wrong, it could take a


1029
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:11,656
couple of times.


1030
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,836
But, this is the only way for


1031
00:28:13,836 --> 00:28:14,996
the MacBook to know who I am.


1032
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:16,836
There's really no other way for


1033
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:18,076
it to verify my identity.


1034
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:20,486
But, if you bring in a Watch,


1035
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,176
well, a Watch is always on and


1036
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:23,856
always with you, and it actually


1037
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:24,676
knows who you are.


1038
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:26,966
So, when these two start talking


1039
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:28,786
to each other, really magical


1040
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:29,526
things can happen.


1041
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:32,226
The Watch can tell you -- can


1042
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:33,526
tell the MacBook, that this is


1043
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:35,796
actually you, and login for you,


1044
00:28:36,026 --> 00:28:37,886
and before you know it, your


1045
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:41,316
MacBook just opens up for you.


1046
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:42,726
What's really important to note


1047
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:44,476
here, is how effortless this


1048
00:28:44,476 --> 00:28:45,076
experience is.


1049
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:47,046
I don't have to tell my MacBook


1050
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:48,236
to listen to my Watch.


1051
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:49,996
I don't have to tell the Watch


1052
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:50,986
to give information to the


1053
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:51,426
MacBook.


1054
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:53,026
It just happens because they're


1055
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:53,536
close.


1056
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:57,226
In fact, I don't have to do


1057
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:57,406
anything.


1058
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:58,476
So, making an experience


1059
00:28:58,476 --> 00:28:59,616
effortless when you have


1060
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,546
multiple platforms available, is


1061
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:02,256
really important.


1062
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:04,936
Adding a platform should not


1063
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:06,306
result in adding additional


1064
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:06,556
steps.


1065
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:09,626
Let's look at another platform,


1066
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:11,266
let's look at the iMac.


1067
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,286
As we said before, iMac, high


1068
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,746
performance, big display, really


1069
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:17,966
good for, for example, browsing


1070
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:18,996
the internet, and maybe even


1071
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:19,396
shopping.


1072
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,776
What the iMac cannot do,


1073
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:23,546
unfortunately, is store your


1074
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:24,866
ApplePay card securely.


1075
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:26,776
Which is why you can't do that


1076
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,686
on an iMac at the moment.


1077
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:30,356
But an iPhone can.


1078
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:32,676
So when these two start talking


1079
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:34,556
to each other, suddenly payments


1080
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:35,096
are possible.


1081
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,596
When you want to buy something


1082
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:38,196
on the iMac, it will tell you to


1083
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,756
go to your phone, your phone


1084
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,126
will use your securely stored


1085
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,196
ApplePay cards, with


1086
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:44,336
authentication with Touch ID,


1087
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:46,256
you confirm the payment, and


1088
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:47,186
you're good to go, the payment


1089
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,526
is complete, and you can keep


1090
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:49,176
shopping.


1091
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,396
And, this doesn't have to be on


1092
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:52,726
an iPhone, this works on an


1093
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:56,476
iPad, or on a Watch.


1094
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:57,956
What's really important here to


1095
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:59,916
note, is how clear the control


1096
00:29:59,916 --> 00:29:59,983
is.


1097
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:02,476
The iMac is clearly telling me


1098
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:03,456
to go to my phone.


1099
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:06,076
On my phone, I get a nice


1100
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:07,506
summary of what I'm going to


1101
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:07,876
purchase.


1102
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:09,516
With Touch ID, I confirm.


1103
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:10,956
The same happens on the Watch


1104
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,166
with double click to confirm,


1105
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:14,076
and before I know it, my


1106
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,426
purchase is complete, and I can


1107
00:30:15,426 --> 00:30:16,786
continue my experience.


1108
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:20,226
So, giving really clear control


1109
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:21,566
is incredibly important when


1110
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:22,856
multiple platforms become


1111
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:23,356
available.


1112
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:25,546
Otherwise, your experience might


1113
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:27,226
become very complicated and


1114
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:27,596
difficult.


1115
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,546
And, lastly, let's look at


1116
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:31,126
Keynote.


1117
00:30:32,236 --> 00:30:33,656
Keynote is a fantastic app to


1118
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:35,226
make presentations, and also to


1119
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:35,626
give them.


1120
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,906
But, one of the downsides of


1121
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:39,076
giving a presentation is that


1122
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:41,506
often, your MacBook is connected


1123
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,156
to a display or a projector.


1124
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:45,596
And, so if you want to move


1125
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:47,586
between the slides, you have to


1126
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,066
stay behind your MacBook because


1127
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:50,716
the keyboard is the only way to


1128
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,486
move between slides.


1129
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:53,756
But when you bring in a phone,


1130
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:54,866
well then, the phone can take


1131
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:56,666
control of what slide is being


1132
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,326
shown, and you can freely move


1133
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,386
around, because the phone is


1134
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:01,516
light, and easy to carry.


1135
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:03,856
What's important to note about


1136
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:04,936
this experience, is that it's


1137
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:05,766
all optional.


1138
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:07,696
If my phone runs out of battery,


1139
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:09,486
or I forget it, I can still go


1140
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,076
back to my MacBook, and use the


1141
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:12,206
keyboard to move between the


1142
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:12,496
slides.


1143
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:15,786
So, making it optional is really


1144
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,736
important for multiple devices


1145
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:18,526
in one experience.


1146
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:22,316
So, that's what extending is


1147
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:22,646
about.


1148
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:24,566
We complement different


1149
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:25,956
platforms by combining their


1150
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:26,586
capabilities.


1151
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,726
We make clear how to control the


1152
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:31,606
different devices, and we work


1153
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:32,786
toward an optional and


1154
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:34,126
effortless experience.


1155
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:38,336
A really good example is Timber


1156
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:38,636
Tennis.


1157
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:40,676
Games have always really well


1158
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:42,136
understood how multiple


1159
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:43,306
platforms can really create a


1160
00:31:43,306 --> 00:31:44,336
magical experience.


1161
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,186
This is a great example.


1162
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:47,876
You can play a multiplayer game


1163
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,106
with multiple devices if you


1164
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:49,536
have them.


1165
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:51,186
It's completely effortless.


1166
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:52,996
With a simple tap of a button,


1167
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:54,036
you can start a multiplayer


1168
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:54,376
game.


1169
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,476
There's very clear control,


1170
00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:58,106
because there's only two buttons


1171
00:31:58,106 --> 00:31:59,966
on the screen, and it's


1172
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:00,746
completely optional.


1173
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,746
You can play with a TV, an


1174
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:04,836
iPhone, or an iPad, or any


1175
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:06,286
combination of that.


1176
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,766
And another good example is


1177
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:10,146
Zova.


1178
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:12,946
Zova works really well even if


1179
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,236
you only have one device.


1180
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:17,236
If you have an iPad, or an


1181
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,096
iPhone, or an Apple TV, you can


1182
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:21,256
start training with Zova, but


1183
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:22,516
the app will always look if


1184
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:23,526
there are more platforms


1185
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,726
available in its surroundings.


1186
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:27,336
For example, if you have a


1187
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:28,816
Watch, it will measure your


1188
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,396
heartbeat, and that information


1189
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:31,496
is shared amongst all the


1190
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:32,456
devices that you are using.


1191
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:33,856
So, for example, that would


1192
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:35,406
reappear on your TV.


1193
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,786
It's a great example of how


1194
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:38,546
effortless this is.


1195
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:39,826
Again, you don't have to do


1196
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:40,686
anything to make this


1197
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:42,066
information being shared across


1198
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:42,646
the devices.


1199
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,296
I don't have to tell my Watch to


1200
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,846
show my heartbeat on the TV.


1201
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:49,066
And, it's completely optional.


1202
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:51,076
Zova works just as well with one


1203
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:52,506
platform as it does with


1204
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:53,396
multiple platforms.


1205
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:58,346
So, that's the entire process.


1206
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:00,546
We started with selecting our


1207
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,086
platform based on the context


1208
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:03,746
and the capabilities of each


1209
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:04,136
platform.


1210
00:33:04,136 --> 00:33:07,616
We looked at prioritizing new


1211
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:08,736
and existing features, and


1212
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,026
taking advantage of unique


1213
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:11,746
capabilities with adapting.


1214
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:14,536
With conform, we tried to find a


1215
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:16,056
balance between our brand and


1216
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:16,886
the platform guidelines.


1217
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,646
In connecting, we looked at what


1218
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:20,856
happens when you go from one


1219
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:22,716
platform to another, and make


1220
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:23,586
that really seamless and


1221
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:23,966
effortless.


1222
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:26,556
And, lastly, we looked at what


1223
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:28,176
magical things can happen when


1224
00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:29,656
multiple devices are available


1225
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:30,916
at the same time.


1226
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:36,076
I said in the beginning, we


1227
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:37,156
design our platforms and our


1228
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:38,626
apps to benefit your day-to-day


1229
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:40,266
life, and create a meaningful


1230
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:40,756
relationship.


1231
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:43,356
In the end, we hope that all of


1232
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,976
our apps and platforms create a


1233
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:46,336
holistic experience that is


1234
00:33:46,396 --> 00:33:47,486
greater than its parts.


1235
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:49,966
With this process we talked


1236
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:51,416
about today, we hope you have


1237
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:52,876
all the tools you need to join


1238
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:53,836
us in that endeavor.


1239
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,556
This talk is always available


1240
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:58,986
with this link, and make sure to


1241
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,496
check out these sessions too.


1242
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,396
There are some really good ones


1243
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,066
tomorrow on design as well.


1244
00:34:04,936 --> 00:34:06,016
We wish you the best of luck in


1245
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:07,296
bringing your apps to Apple's


1246
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:07,946
ecosystem.


1247
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,366
Enjoy the rest of WWDC, and


1248
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:10,666
thank you very much.
