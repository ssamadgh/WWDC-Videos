1
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:12,976
>> Welcome.


2
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:18,546
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:20,546
So welcome to "Ingredients
of Great Games".


4
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,606
What we're going to talk
about today is some things


5
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:27,176
that you can do in your game to
make it really, really great.


6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,876
Because having a fun game
is simply not enough.


7
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:34,236
There are things
that great games do.


8
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:37,826
What I mean is, games that are
recognized as industry leading


9
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:39,286
in the games industry.


10
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:40,926
Things that they do
that you should be doing


11
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:44,106
or what you really need to be
doing to make your game great.


12
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:46,726
And there's a massive
opportunity.


13
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:48,786
As Tim talked about yesterday,


14
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:53,276
there's 75 billion
downloads of applications.


15
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,446
And as everyone in
this room knows,


16
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:58,246
a huge portion of
those are games.


17
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:01,586
Game Center also reinforces this


18
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:06,436
with 130 million monthly
active users last month.


19
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:10,456
That is a huge audience that
you can tap into for your game.


20
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:13,856
But, and to do that, you need
to start with a great idea,


21
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:18,826
obviously put in hard work, and
you need to follow some really,


22
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,976
really important key tips
to make your game great.


23
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:26,216
So over the last couple days,
yesterday and this morning,


24
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:27,766
we've been talking
about technology.


25
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:32,286
And so technology like OpenGL
ES 3.0, which was introduced


26
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:37,566
since WWDC last year, and is
the most advanced OpenGL ES


27
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:38,226
out there.


28
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:43,456
We also have Metal, our low
level highly optimized GPU API.


29
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:45,646
We have Game Center,
which provides


30
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,636
that social connection
for your players.


31
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:49,726
SpriteKit and SceneKit.


32
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:52,306
You know, let us do the
heavy lifting for you.


33
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:55,506
If you don't need to go
right to OpenGL or Metal,


34
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:56,956
you can use SpriteKit
and SceneKit.


35
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:00,876
It'll allow you to do less
programming and let us build


36
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:02,736
out efficient API
underneath your game.


37
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:06,956
And Game Controllers: open your
game up to many forms of input.


38
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:12,186
Of course, there's also Xcode
6 with Swift and Playground.


39
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:18,956
We have tools like the
Metal or OpenGL Debuggers.


40
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:22,246
We have SceneKit and
SpriteKit editors.


41
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:25,216
And, also this week,
we have a mass amount


42
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,906
of sessions about games.


43
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:31,736
We have three on Metal, two
on SceneKit, two on SpriteKit.


44
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,666
We have labs on all of
these technologies all week,


45
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,456
and we have sessions
about developer tools.


46
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:40,936
But technology alone
is not enough.


47
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:44,076
You can't just take the
technology, build a game on top


48
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,426
of it, and expect
it to be successful.


49
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:49,606
You have to go about the games
business and the business


50
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:52,386
of building a game with the
same passion that you would go


51
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:53,546
about your game design


52
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:56,576
or choosing your technology
or your graphics API.


53
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,926
If you look at the winners


54
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:03,976
from the Apple Design Awards
last night, like "Threes",


55
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:08,656
"Leo's Fortune", "DEVICE 6",
"Blek", or "Monument Valley",


56
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,036
they have some common
traits that attract,


57
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,576
engage and retain their players.


58
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:16,736
And this engagement
is key to success.


59
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:22,256
So what we find are there are
some common threads among these


60
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:23,196
successful games.


61
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:26,606
Things like, make it easy
to buy and play your game


62
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,436
by reducing the friction.


63
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:34,336
Or refresh your content to
continually be able to retain


64
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:35,356
and engage those players.


65
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,156
As I said, engagement
is really key.


66
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:41,516
We've identified these and
other traits among these games.


67
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:44,916
And I'd like to invite Allan
Schaffer up on stage to talk


68
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,566
about these key ingredients
for great games.


69
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,766
>> Thank you, sir.


70
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,786
Hello, everyone.


71
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,756
Welcome to WWDC 2014 and games.


72
00:03:58,456 --> 00:03:59,936
So my name is Allan Schaffer.


73
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:02,566
I'm the Game Technologies
Evangelist at Apple.


74
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:05,576
And, as Geoff said, I'm here
to talk to you about some


75
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:09,086
of the things we see in some
of the best games on iOS.


76
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:11,996
Now, there's a lot
of things that go


77
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:13,706
into making a great game.


78
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:17,136
And a lot of different ways to
describe that process, right?


79
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:19,956
But to echo back to what he was
saying, when we look at games


80
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:22,646
and we think about the
Apple Design Award winners


81
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,906
over the years, we start to
see common threads and the kind


82
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:28,746
of key ingredients that all
of these games get right.


83
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,296
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.


84
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:35,206
So I'm going to go through a
list of some of these things


85
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:36,756
that just really
stand out to me.


86
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:39,766
There is a lot more than
what I'm going to go through,


87
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:43,446
but here is the first
thing on my list: Okay,


88
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,706
is to remove friction.


89
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:50,256
So I'm talking here about
making a great first impression


90
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,916
and a really frictionless first
time experience in the game,


91
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:58,356
really streamlining
everything that gets in the way


92
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:01,066
of the player getting into
the game as they start.


93
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:03,376
So what do I really
mean by friction here?


94
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:07,746
So here's our imaginary
game, "Paddle Mania 3000".


95
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:08,876
It is awesome, by the way.


96
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:12,506
But it has some of the
problems with friction


97
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:13,766
that I'm thinking of here.


98
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,206
So let me show you first
the start up experience


99
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:18,646
of this game: Player comes in?


100
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:22,576
Loading. So, yeah,
still loading.


101
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,776
And it's going to take
it about a minute to load


102
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:25,966
because that's how
long it will take me


103
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,046
to get through the slide.


104
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:30,766
So, you know, the problem
that I have or that I see here


105
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:33,806
with a number of games is
that they really take kind


106
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:37,466
of a monolithic approach
to loading their assets.


107
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:41,786
And they preload everything
up front instead of, you know,


108
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:44,626
trying to just do what they
need just to get started.


109
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:48,366
So your goal should
be to get interactive


110
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,926
as quickly as you can.


111
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,296
Load just enough of your
assets so that you can get up


112
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:55,616
and running to your
first interactive screen.


113
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:58,356
And then use technologies
like Grand Central Dispatch,


114
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:02,286
and so on, to move work off
of your main thread and so,


115
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:04,326
and let that continue
asynchronously.


116
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:09,366
Then, also, use the Time
Profiler to really take a look


117
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,166
at your loading performance.


118
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:13,706
And it will show you in a lot


119
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,836
of detail exactly what work the
app is doing during that time.


120
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:21,396
But even before you get into
the Time Profiler, I don't want


121
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:24,376
to just punt to the Time
Profiler as my advice.


122
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:28,616
You have to really think
about it first, right?


123
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:31,546
Why are so many things
being loaded up front?


124
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:34,986
And isn't there something
that could be deferred


125
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:39,006
and loaded asynchronously
a little bit later?


126
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:41,726
So, okay. So it's done loading.


127
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:46,996
And now let's go on to now
we're downloading some assets.


128
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:50,896
Okay. So, you know, a lot of
you guys do this in the game.


129
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:51,596
And it's fine.


130
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,566
In many cases, it's
a good thing.


131
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:56,406
But it doesn't have
to be something


132
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,586
where it makes the player wait.


133
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:02,276
So later in the talk I'm going
to go through a couple of things


134
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,726
that you can do to move
this off to the side


135
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:07,056
so the user doesn't
even have to notice it.


136
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:11,256
Okay, next: registration.


137
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:13,366
Would I like a "Paddle
Mania" account?


138
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:16,386
No, I would like to
play "Paddle Mania".


139
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:21,156
So, you know, when you think
about the registration,


140
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:23,416
there's a couple of
possibilities here.


141
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:27,166
You know, maybe, actually
that registration is needed.


142
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,386
Maybe you have a game
that is server backed,


143
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:33,536
and you need some way to
uniquely identify this player.


144
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,486
If that's the case,


145
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:39,236
then actually you could just use
the Vendor ID that we provide


146
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:42,776
to the game as the unique
identifier for that player.


147
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,616
And get it so that it's
out of the player's way.


148
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,216
Handle it automatically.


149
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:51,426
But maybe the case isn't that
you have a server backed game.


150
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:53,906
Maybe you're just asking the
user to sign up for an account


151
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,526
because you want to give
them news or special offers


152
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:59,446
or just whatever
the reason may be.


153
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,516
Well, the first-time experience


154
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,626
in the game is not the right
time to ask for this yet.


155
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:09,296
They don't who, you know,
why you might be asking.


156
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:12,226
So, of course, you would
need to clearly explain it.


157
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,226
Like, is it needed?


158
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,756
Or is it just kind of extra?


159
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:19,556
And if it's not really needed,
then defer it until later.


160
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:22,396
So I want to play, I'm
going to say, no thanks.


161
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:26,246
Next, configure my paddle.


162
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:27,596
It's "Paddle Mania".


163
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,236
But, so, let me be clear:


164
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:33,385
If this is my first
time playing the game,


165
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,606
then I don't know the
implications of any


166
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:38,056
of these choices,
right, to go and play.


167
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:42,256
So if they matter, then
now is not the time


168
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,775
to ask me because I don't know.


169
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:47,736
And if they don't matter,
then don't put them in the way


170
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,866
of user getting onboard
into the game.


171
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:55,476
And, you know, not knowing
either way sort of conveys


172
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:58,886
to the players that it's not
really-the experience here


173
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,446
hadn't really been
thought through.


174
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:03,056
And so there's some real trouble
with "Paddle Mania", actually.


175
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,286
And then, yeah, there we go.


176
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,906
The last one here:
please leave a rating.


177
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:13,526
You know, this is fine, right,
we talk about this all the time.


178
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,356
But, you know, at
this point, actually,


179
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,106
I haven't even played
the game yet.


180
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:21,296
So, you know, now is not
the best time to come


181
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,756
and ask me about rating it.


182
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:26,086
But, you know, I think, you
guys are getting it here, right.


183
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,216
So let me give you the
takeaways of this first section:


184
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,686
So you've got to get the
player into the game.


185
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:34,236
Reduce the load time
and any blocking updates


186
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:37,306
to get the game interactive
as quickly as possible.


187
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:40,226
Then streamline the
registration, right.


188
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:43,866
Provide an escape from
tutorials and long intros


189
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,606
and all those things that
might get in the way.


190
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:49,846
And then don't force
decisions about something


191
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:52,846
that the player can't
possibly know about yet.


192
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:55,666
And be patient, you
know, show some restraint


193
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,296
when you're asking for feedback.


194
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:00,966
So that's number
one: remove friction


195
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,766
from the first time experience.


196
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:07,146
Okay, here's number
two: be a good teacher.


197
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:11,766
So being a good teacher is
really all about thinking


198
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:13,496
through that onboarding
experience


199
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,316
and really kind of
making it fun.


200
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:19,826
Because if you can help
your players get started,


201
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,806
it's more likely that they'll
become more deeply engaged


202
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:23,676
into the game.


203
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:26,406
And, you know, it's
almost easier to think


204
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:27,576
of it on the other side.


205
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,806
If you just leave it
to the player to figure


206
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:34,596
out your game themselves,
then you run a lot of risks.


207
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:37,466
You risk people just
failing a couple of times


208
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:39,956
and getting frustrated
and leaving the game.


209
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:43,986
Or maybe they'll miss something
that was really important


210
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,696
to the gameplay and would
have captured their interest,


211
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:47,936
but they just didn't see it.


212
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:50,306
They didn't know to
go down that path.


213
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,906
So yesterday during the
design award ceremony,


214
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:53,696
John was up here.


215
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,546
He talked about "Leo's
Fortune" as his example.


216
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:58,446
I'm going to use a
different example:


217
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:03,626
Apple Design Award Winner from
2011, and that's "Cut the Rope".


218
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:06,046
So this was an awesome
puzzle game.


219
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:09,016
And it's kind of the
perfect example here to use


220
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,956
as an onboarding case study.


221
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:15,156
So right away what you see here
is they're using coaching tips


222
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,076
to explain the goal,
which is to deliver candy


223
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:19,456
to Om Nom, the little character.


224
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,556
And then they start to
tell you about things


225
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,186
like the primary interaction.


226
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:25,576
In "Cut the Rope", you swipe


227
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,216
with your finger
to cut the rope.


228
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:30,016
Now you might be looking at
this kind of going like, well,


229
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:30,926
that's totally obvious.


230
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,776
But, no, it's only because
you've seen this picture.


231
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:38,426
And so the, you know what
people would do without this,


232
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:41,656
they would tap the candy,
they would tap Om Nom trying


233
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:43,596
to get him to jump
up and eat the candy.


234
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:44,576
They don't know what to do.


235
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,836
And those aren't the
right interactions, right?


236
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:49,646
The correct one is to
swipe, cut the rope.


237
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:53,526
So then once the
player has that down,


238
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:56,446
then they start introducing new
interactions one at that time.


239
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,866
So each time there's
another coaching tip.


240
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:03,126
So here you cut the rope,
the candy flows down,


241
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:04,156
it goes into the bubble,


242
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,216
and then the bubble will
start to lift it up.


243
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:09,946
And then there's another tip
put right in context once


244
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:12,726
that happens telling the
player to pop the bubble


245
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:15,456
with their finger and
that will release it


246
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,626
and it will come down to Om Nom.


247
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:23,426
Okay. And then more really
sort of subtle thing is


248
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:27,906
that a big part of the
gameplay in Cut the Rope comes


249
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:30,456
from trying to get the candy


250
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:35,566
to touch all the stars before
it gets down to Om Nom and kind


251
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:36,926
of routing around that way.


252
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,166
And to be successful at that
usually takes some trial


253
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,526
and error on every level


254
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,906
when you're actually
playing the game.


255
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:46,946
So it's actually really
important to the Core Loop


256
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:52,196
of this game to show players
how they can try again, right.


257
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:55,976
So in their onboarding, they
call that out specifically.


258
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,996
And you would think oh,
that's just, you know,


259
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,856
okay fine they're showing
me around the buttons.


260
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:03,306
But, no, if they had left
that to the player to discover


261
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:05,756
on their own, some people
might not have played


262
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:08,666
around with all the buttons and
the menus to go and play again.


263
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,896
But really this is
core to the gameplay


264
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,956
so that's why they show it.


265
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:15,636
But, okay, so to summarize now:


266
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:19,876
So start by bringing the
player right into the game


267
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,546
and show them how
to get started.


268
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:25,386
And then introduce more complex
interactions one at that time.


269
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:28,806
Provide tips and
context as you go along


270
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:32,726
and then help them discover the
things that will be important


271
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:34,636
in the game as they
play through it.


272
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,926
So that's number two:
be a good teacher.


273
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,166
Now, I want to mention, also,
we're having a related session.


274
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,506
It's going to be on
Thursday, very aptly named,


275
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:46,866
"Making a Great First Impression
with Strong Onboarding Design".


276
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,456
We'll spend a whole hour
going through some examples


277
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:50,956
that really get this right.


278
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,606
So be sure to catch
that on Thursday.


279
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:57,816
All right, now I want to turn
focus to the gameplay itself.


280
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:02,116
So number three is to really
tune and perfect your Core Loop.


281
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:04,366
You know, I talk to
people all the time.


282
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:06,996
And people will ask me to
take a look at their game,


283
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,206
give them some feedback, you
know stuff under development.


284
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:12,486
And a lot of times what I'm
looking at is something,


285
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:15,716
you know, they're saying, I just
it doesn't really feel fun yet.


286
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,446
And what that really comes
down to is the Core Loop.


287
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:23,126
So Core Loop is the
term that wraps up how


288
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,786
to describe the game mechanic
in terms of, you know,


289
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:27,836
the actions the player
takes in the game;


290
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:30,916
the reward that they
receive, you know,


291
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:35,816
as they're pursuing a goal;
and the resulting expansion


292
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:40,086
of the game or the growth of the
character that motivated them


293
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,236
to pursue that reward.


294
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,396
And just in games that
aren't quite right,


295
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:46,996
what I often find is that
there's some disconnect


296
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:51,026
in this cycle or some
mismatch between the parts


297
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:52,796
so they don't really
line up well.


298
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,386
But, so let me just
illustrate this


299
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,576
by showing you some typical
examples from different genres,


300
00:14:58,576 --> 00:14:59,746
just to set the stage.


301
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:02,326
So, you know, here is a
fantasy role playing game.


302
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:05,046
I explore the dungeon.


303
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:06,746
I fight enemies.


304
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:09,676
Defeating the enemies gets
me treasure and experience.


305
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:12,706
And then I use that
treasure and experience


306
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:15,306
to level up and to buy things.


307
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:17,236
And then that lets
me go and fight more


308
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:18,786
and more powerful enemies, okay?


309
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:19,336
Very clear.


310
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:23,296
Or a platformer, you know, the
basic idea in a platformer is


311
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,616
to run and jump, okay,
that's the player action.


312
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,616
But their goal is really to
complete the level itself


313
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:31,086
and avoid all the
obstacles and the bad guys


314
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:33,336
and collect the stars
or power ups


315
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:35,166
or whatever is happening
on that level.


316
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,616
But then if you're
successful the expansion is


317
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:42,106
to unlock the next stage,
literally expand the universe,


318
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,216
the game universe,
for that game.


319
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,796
And where then you then go
and find new things to run


320
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,786
and jump over, new
obstacles, and so on.


321
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:51,186
But, okay.


322
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:54,006
So now to get a little
deeper, you know,


323
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:56,686
it's really worth
noting that some


324
00:15:56,686 --> 00:15:58,816
of the most compelling
games are the ones


325
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,066
with more than one Core Loop.


326
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,136
And I'm showing these
side by side.


327
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:05,516
But really they're
meant to be overlapping.


328
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,546
So you're fighting monsters,


329
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,146
you gain experience,
you're leveling up.


330
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:12,126
But, at the same time,
you're collecting clues.


331
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,356
You're using the clues
to solve a puzzle.


332
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:16,676
The puzzle lets you
unlock a door.


333
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,686
Behind the door there's more
monsters and more clues.


334
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:23,276
And these are overlaid in the
experience on top of each other.


335
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:25,186
But, okay.


336
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:28,996
So let me give you some
more concrete advice here.


337
00:16:28,996 --> 00:16:31,356
So, you know, what
really is the bottom line?


338
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:36,176
So the best games, first,
are the ones that really,


339
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:40,576
clearly understand their
target audience and are able


340
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:43,416
to put center excuse
me, put the centerpoint


341
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,686
of the Core Loop right
on top of that audience.


342
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:51,186
And it's important that the Core
Loop be easy to express and kind


343
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:52,326
of easy to understand.


344
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,196
That's kind of, when
I find games


345
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:57,956
that are have these little
mismatches, usually it's a case


346
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:59,756
where it's difficult
for the developer


347
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:02,906
to actually express the
Core Loop, these components,


348
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:06,175
clearly in terms of the action,
the reward, the expansion.


349
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,806
Now, as I have been
saying, make sure each phase


350
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:12,746
of this feeds right
into the next.


351
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:15,016
And, sort of, all of the
energy that the player gives


352
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:17,726
into one part of it flows
around and, kind of,


353
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:19,266
reinforces the other parts.


354
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:23,286
Make each iteration meaningful.


355
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:25,336
And I'll talk about this
a little more as I talk


356
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,286
about progression in the game.


357
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,866
But then also question
your assumptions.


358
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:33,696
And this is probably the best
advice for any developer is


359
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,346
to go back and really
rethink it and keep iterating


360
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,696
until you know you've
done it well.


361
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,406
And, you know, how do you know?


362
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:43,546
How do you really know?


363
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:47,396
I could say playtest, but
that's just a punt, right.


364
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:51,256
It's like, how do you really
know that you did it well?


365
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:56,026
Well, you know it by really
thinking it through yourself.


366
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:59,336
You know, if you find the
clues, will you be able


367
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:02,666
to solve the puzzle without
some giant leap of faith


368
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,276
or going online to Google how
to figure out this puzzle.


369
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:10,676
Well, you know, if you unlock
something, if you solve


370
00:18:10,676 --> 00:18:13,386
that puzzle, is it going
to unlock the next stage?


371
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:16,576
If you unlock that next stage,
will I have something new


372
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,926
or novel to really look
at once I get there?


373
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,956
Okay. So test it.


374
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:25,046
But, at the same time,
don't feel boxed in.


375
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,326
I am not saying that
every game needs


376
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:31,576
to follow the same design
methodology or, you know,


377
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:34,226
kind of deal with its
audience in the same way.


378
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:36,906
A lot of the really
best expressions


379
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:40,706
of great games are the ones that
aren't afraid to mix this up.


380
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:45,166
But, so, now, let me show
you just a quick example,


381
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:47,786
a game that's really
fantastic in the way


382
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:50,376
that it does its Core Loop is
the Apple Design Award winner


383
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:53,046
last year, this is "Ridiculous
Fishing" by Vlambeer.


384
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,806
So it really has, I
think you could break it


385
00:18:56,806 --> 00:18:58,976
down into three distinct
mechanics.


386
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:03,216
The first one is when you
are dropping your line


387
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:03,926
into the water.


388
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,566
You're just trying to, you're
using the accelerometer


389
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:08,456
or the gyroscope and
trying to get the line


390
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:10,896
down through the water
avoiding the fish,


391
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,326
get it as deep as you can.


392
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:16,576
Okay. Then once you run out
of line or once you hit a fish


393
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:19,186
on the way down,
everything reverses.


394
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,976
And now you're going
back up and reeling


395
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,766
in as many fish as you can.


396
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,846
We're back on the gyro again
and just trying now to collect


397
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:29,576
as many of the fish
and try to run


398
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,776
into them while avoiding
the jellyfish


399
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:33,156
and other baddies
that are there.


400
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:37,716
And then the third loop, when
we get up to the surface,


401
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:42,146
of course, we fling the fish up
into the air and then you tap


402
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:44,836
on them to shoot them
out of the sky, right,


403
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:46,756
so and collect points.


404
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:50,936
And so, and then those
points are what we use


405
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,066
as the expansion in the game.


406
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,856
It lets us get a better lure,
a longer line, and so on.


407
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,356
And so the game is really,
you know, hilarious.


408
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:00,966
And if you didn't
see it last year


409
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,646
from the design awards,
check it out.


410
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,876
But so that's tuning
your Core Loop.


411
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,876
Now, let me expand
out from there.


412
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:13,726
And so for the next few parts
of the talk, I want to go


413
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:17,766
through some aspects of this
next ring around the Core Loop


414
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:20,736
and I want to start with
the interaction mechanic.


415
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,756
Because obviously, you know,
how the player interacts


416
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:25,296
with your game is completely
fundamental to the success


417
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,346
of the Core Loop,
to it feeling fun.


418
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:30,906
And if your players seem
to be having trouble


419
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:33,286
with the controls,
this is where to start.


420
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:36,506
And it's to design for touch.


421
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:38,836
So sometimes when I'm working


422
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:41,246
with someone who's
bringing a game over to iOS


423
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,026
from another platform like a
PC or a console or whatever,


424
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:49,006
their first instinct is actually
to just bring their Core Loop


425
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:52,606
over completely unchanged,
you know, including all


426
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:54,996
of their old interaction
mechanic, right.


427
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:58,166
And so, you know, if their game
was based on pressing buttons


428
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,016
than they just overlay
the screen,


429
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,176
superimpose some buttons.


430
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:05,006
Or if they used to use a
D pad, then, okay, great,


431
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,226
then they'll put a virtual
D pad on the screen.


432
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,046
But the truth is that this is
usually not really optimal.


433
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:13,076
These overlays get in the way


434
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:15,476
of the player seeing
the game field.


435
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:18,906
And, but more profoundly,
they're indirect.


436
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:20,986
They're controls
that are controlling


437
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:23,566
that little paddle that's
going to go underneath.


438
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:26,316
And, you know, it's a
bouncy ball game, right?


439
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:31,566
And so since they're indirect,
it relies on the player


440
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,576
to really be able
to be in control


441
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:35,096
of the controls themselves.


442
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:38,506
But they can't feel when their
finger is in the right spot.


443
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,016
And so they kind of have to look
at their finger a lot in order


444
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,976
to be confident in
their actions.


445
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:48,146
Okay. Now, if you step back
a moment and really think


446
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:51,036
about where all this is
coming from, you know,


447
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:54,296
if the game was designed with a
different interaction mechanic


448
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:57,336
in mind, then a lot
of the assumptions


449
00:21:57,336 --> 00:22:00,336
of that other mechanic just
get built into the game.


450
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:03,806
They become kind of implicit and
ultimately kind of forgotten.


451
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:09,716
And when that happens, the
answer isn't just to, kind of,


452
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:11,586
remap some controls


453
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:14,036
onto a virtual joystick
or virtual buttons.


454
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:18,686
You really need to go back
and rethink those assumptions.


455
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:22,276
And, you know, go back
and redesign for touch.


456
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:25,746
And if you're not sure what I
really, really mean by this,


457
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,796
then let's just go
back and look at some


458
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:30,546
of the Design Award winners
over the past couple of years.


459
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:34,866
"Monument Valley": tap the
path, and that directs Ida


460
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:36,006
around to walk around.


461
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,536
She's the main character.


462
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:40,766
And then you or you do
these little twist gestures


463
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:44,046
and that'll turn the cranks
and move the walkways.


464
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,126
So it's based on
taps and gestures.


465
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,696
"Blek": You make a
shake with your finger.


466
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:54,046
And that's the pattern that the
stroke that's generated is going


467
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:56,726
to follow and you try
and get that to repeat.


468
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:58,746
And try to hit the dots.


469
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:00,416
By the way, I'm going
to hang this picture


470
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,966
in John's office
when we get back.


471
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:06,706
So but it's about
stroking a path.


472
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:10,986
"Threes". So in "Threes", you
push the tiles against the walls


473
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:14,146
to make, you know, matching
numbers join together.


474
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:15,456
It's very, kind of, physical.


475
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,806
You're pushing the tiles.


476
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:18,996
They're coming, they're
squeezing together


477
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:20,046
against the walls, and so on.


478
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:23,836
But it's all based on
short strokes and swipes.


479
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:26,296
Infinity Blade.


480
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:29,396
You swipe the screen to control
how your character's going


481
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:30,706
to swing its sword.


482
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:35,606
Then there's some buttons you
press to dodge, and raise,


483
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:37,476
you know, you put
on your shield.


484
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:41,786
And there's some gestures
you use to cast a spell.


485
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:45,926
But so it's taps,
swipes, and gestures.


486
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:48,606
"Cut the Rope": We
just showed you.


487
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:51,206
You swipe to cut the rope,
and then you tap things


488
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:55,476
like balloons and you tap on the
bubbles and so on to blow air


489
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,596
around or pop the bubbles.


490
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:58,326
So it's taps and swipes.


491
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:01,846
"Where's My Water": You
guys are getting this.


492
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:06,666
You know, you take your finger,
you drag a path through the dirt


493
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:08,686
and that's where the
water is going to flow.


494
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:12,186
So you feel your finger
touching the glass.


495
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:17,366
You instantly get audio feedback
when you touch the screen.


496
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:20,656
You feel the friction
as you draw that path,


497
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:22,236
move your finger around.


498
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:25,346
And you instantly see
the path you drew.


499
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:28,106
So it's a game that
gets everything right.


500
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:29,286
Everything is in sync.


501
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:33,356
So let's take all this and
sort of distill it down


502
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:34,916
and summarize what
I mean by this.


503
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:38,316
So the key to what
all those games,


504
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:43,036
and others that are all doing,
is to design their controls


505
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:45,986
around direct interactions
reinforced


506
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:48,206
by instantaneous feedback.


507
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:51,446
So direct manipulation
is the key


508
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:53,606
to that interaction
model on iOS.


509
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:55,436
You've got to embrace the idea


510
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:59,606
that the best iOS games are
the ones where you reach


511
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:04,576
through the glass and touch the
game elements themselves, right.


512
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:08,236
So it's based on touches and
taps and gestures and swipes


513
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:10,236
and panning and drawing paths


514
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:15,326
where those interactions are the
ones that define the gameplay.


515
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:21,676
And then it's critical that you
provide instantaneous feedback.


516
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:26,116
So these are the visual cues and
audio cues so that what you see


517
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:31,456
and what you hear and what you
feel all reinforce what you did.


518
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,466
And they reinforce each other.


519
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:35,436
But, okay.


520
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:39,636
So, with all that passion,
that was designed for touch.


521
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,956
But if people seem to be
having a lot of trouble


522
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:47,116
with your controls, go
back to those principles


523
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:50,516
and really redesign your
Core Loop around the idea


524
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,246
of direct interactions
that are reinforced


525
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,016
by instantaneous feedback.


526
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:58,996
Okay, next is to
foster engagement.


527
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,956
So, you know, this about
keeping the player coming back


528
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:03,876
to your game.


529
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,646
And we use a lot of different
terms to describe this,


530
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:08,946
you know, it's a
huge, a huge area.


531
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:12,236
But all this is done because,
just hopefully, you know,


532
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:15,836
having a really deeply engaged
player is going to generate word


533
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:19,326
of mouth and viral discovery,
more business for you,


534
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:21,126
more of a fan base, and so on.


535
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,736
And there are a ton of
things to talk about here.


536
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:28,316
But, you know, and I'll get
to some specifics in a minute.


537
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:31,716
But I want to first say
something else that's a little


538
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,576
deeper about this.


539
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,896
So it's really easy for
any of us to, kind of,


540
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,286
get wrapped up in the
details of the Core Loop


541
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:42,816
and the onboarding and so on.


542
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:49,466
But it's important for you to be
able to rise above those details


543
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:53,816
of the game and really see the
game from the player perspective


544
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:58,186
and understand that the
design process here is


545
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,266
profoundly fractal.


546
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:05,426
The same patterns emerge
at every level of detail.


547
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:08,006
And there are resonances
among them.


548
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:12,096
So even if you get the
game loop completely right,


549
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:16,066
if you can't rise above
that, it won't resonate


550
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:17,846
with your meta game
or your progression.


551
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:22,236
If you get the progression right
but you can't rise above that,


552
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:25,986
it won't resonate with the
storyline, and so on and so on.


553
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:27,886
But, okay.


554
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:31,516
So now taking this down a notch,
back to Earth just a moment.


555
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:35,666
Do you remember how a couple
of moments ago I said that,


556
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,146
you know, a lot of really
interesting games overlay


557
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:39,436
multiple Core Loops?


558
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:42,816
Well, that holds true for
the progression as well.


559
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:45,036
And so one way that
you can really get,


560
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:48,826
hold the player's interest is
to provide layers of progression


561
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:52,386
or overlays of it, of
progression and expansion


562
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:55,496
with multiple goals, multiple
paths of goals, I mean,


563
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:57,576
multiple paths of challenges,


564
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,936
and different paths
giving different balance


565
00:28:01,936 --> 00:28:03,836
between risk and reward.


566
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:07,106
That's something that players
will find very, very compelling.


567
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:11,556
And you can even gamify
the expansions themselves.


568
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,996
So this is, you know, kind
of the essence of a lot


569
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:17,996
of crafting games is that you
make the expansions themselves


570
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,466
into choices that the players
have to make that are strategic


571
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,236
to the future of their gameplay.


572
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:26,356
And then you ensure
that you take them


573
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:30,086
down different paths
depending on what they've done.


574
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:31,666
But, okay.


575
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:35,136
This next one now, so this
is particularly important


576
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:37,186
for anyone who's making
free to play games.


577
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:40,326
And that's to provide
value for everyone,


578
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:43,966
both your paying players
and your non-paying players.


579
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:48,176
So work through the
entire experience for both


580
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:51,066
of those audiences
to ensure that those


581
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:56,006
who are playing your game for
free can progress, can expand,


582
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,656
and, sure, they can
see the benefit.


583
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:01,496
Show them the benefit of
becoming a paying player.


584
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:05,436
But if you try to force them,
then you'll lose engagement


585
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:07,126
with a fair number of them.


586
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:11,516
And on the other side, ensure
that those who are paying


587
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,506
in your game will feel


588
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:16,006
that they're getting
properly rewarded in the game


589
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,296
and getting something for the
money that they're spending.


590
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,286
Then next, again, this is
holding the player's interest.


591
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:27,876
So really do what you can
to incentivize repeat play.


592
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:32,886
So enable and motivate the
player to try one more time.


593
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:36,276
Enable and motivate the
player to see what's next.


594
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:40,416
Enable and motivate to
see how it ends, right.


595
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,566
And if you think about
where these fit in,


596
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,606
"one more try" is
about the Core Loop.


597
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:48,926
"See what's next" is
about the progression.


598
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:53,106
"See how it ends" is about
the storyline, right.


599
00:29:54,746 --> 00:29:59,976
Okay. Now, let me talk a
bit about re engagement.


600
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:02,356
So providing really,
you know, coming out


601
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:05,146
and providing really
fresh new content


602
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,926
after you've launched
is a great way


603
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:10,376
to keep your momentum
going and, in many cases,


604
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,406
even to help drive new growth.


605
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:16,846
So really think about how
you will continue your story


606
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:20,506
to provide new content or
new levels or new goals


607
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:21,826
or challenges, and so on.


608
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:25,146
Or seasonal content
around holidays.


609
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:27,846
Or regional content
in different locales.


610
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,686
It's all to give your players
another positive reason


611
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,336
to come back into the game.


612
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:38,156
And it's important that you
plan this out before you launch.


613
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:43,496
Because the people who have had
catastrophic success are the


614
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:45,566
ones who a game takes off


615
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:47,606
and then they realize
people are done.


616
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:51,116
And they need to scramble
to get more content out.


617
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,476
You're most engaged
players are going


618
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:58,216
to consume your content very
quickly; so have it ready.


619
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:01,076
Have it ready to go
so that your really,


620
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,516
deeply engaged players can
have something that's going


621
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:05,006
to bring them back
into the game.


622
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:09,316
And you'll attract new
players to come in as well.


623
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:12,256
Now, it's also important
to really measure


624
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:15,016
and understand how well
you're retaining your players.


625
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,216
And starting later this fall,


626
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:21,116
we'll be providing
retention information to you


627
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:22,536
through iTunes Connect.


628
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:25,736
So this is going to show you
how many players have downloaded


629
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:30,356
your game by day, by region,
by platform, by source


630
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:34,576
and what percentage of them
kept playing in the days


631
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:36,816
that followed their download.


632
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:39,936
And so this is just
a taste, okay.


633
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:42,116
So we'll show you a
lot more about this


634
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:45,356
in the iTunes Connect
session tomorrow morning.


635
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:49,736
But so that's number five:
to foster engagement.


636
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:53,816
So now, let me turn the
focus the other way and get


637
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:56,046
into a couple of things
on the technical side.


638
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:59,866
And so this is number six:
to use background transfers.


639
00:32:00,356 --> 00:32:01,216
Huh? Okay.


640
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:04,176
So you remember back
in the first section


641
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:05,596
where I was talking
about friction,


642
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:07,476
I talked about downloading
updates,


643
00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:10,076
and I said that that was
something that we could move


644
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:11,236
out of the player's way?


645
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:14,856
That's what this is about and
that's what I'll get into here.


646
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:18,436
So in "Paddle Mania
3000", we have, you know,


647
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,526
thousands of image
assets because we have


648
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:21,876
so many levels, right.


649
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:25,026
We have-and for all of
those different assets,


650
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:28,936
we have one for Retina,
non Retina, iPhone 5s,


651
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,596
the iPad, iPad Air, right.


652
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:32,606
And then we have
all of our sounds,


653
00:32:32,606 --> 00:32:34,976
AAC and MP3 for our soundtrack.


654
00:32:34,976 --> 00:32:39,236
We've got Linear PCM for
audio effects with OpenAL.


655
00:32:39,676 --> 00:32:42,806
We've got 13 different
localizations, right.


656
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:46,296
So English, French, you
know, EFIGS, Japanese,


657
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:48,866
Traditional Chinese,
Simplified Chinese, Brazilian,


658
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,226
Portuguese, and a few more.


659
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:53,536
And then we have a binary
compiled three different,


660
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:57,326
you know, three ways:
armv7, armv7s, arm64.


661
00:32:57,326 --> 00:33:01,386
Okay. So there's a lot of
stuff in "Paddle Mania 3000".


662
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:05,266
And you know putting all
that together is putting us


663
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,806
over the limit for
downloading over cellular.


664
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:10,806
So what do you do?


665
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:15,556
Well, you know, a lot of times,
a discussion will begin, and,


666
00:33:15,556 --> 00:33:17,786
you know, quite often there
will be somebody who will chime


667
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:22,006
in with advice like this:
"One size fits all!"


668
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:23,926
Just ship one size.


669
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:24,746
Stretch it.


670
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,236
Stretch it to fit
on all platforms,


671
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:29,616
or just ship one localization.


672
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,316
They all speak English, right?


673
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,626
No, they really don't.


674
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:37,306
So don't sacrifice quality.


675
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:40,656
And don't shortchange
your global audience.


676
00:33:41,196 --> 00:33:44,976
Realize that what you could
probably get your game


677
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:48,596
under 100 megabytes if you use
background transfers, you know,


678
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:51,686
and let the user download
the main bundle of it now


679
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:54,026
but have more content
that gets transferred


680
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,056
down after they've
run it the first time.


681
00:33:57,126 --> 00:33:59,406
So there's a couple of
things to do this now.


682
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:02,336
So the first step really is
to take a good solid look


683
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:05,696
at your game and the
game design and determine


684
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,016
if there is some content


685
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,485
that isn't really
needed right up front.


686
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:12,545
And games, especially
games with any kind


687
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:16,485
of a linear progression are
perfect for this, right.


688
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:19,275
You put the first couple of
hours or whatever, you know,


689
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:23,226
the first 20, 30 levels in
the bundle at full quality.


690
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,696
And then that's going to
provide enough time for the user


691
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:29,666
to be playing, and then you
use background transfers


692
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:32,576
to download the rest while
their playing those first 20.


693
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,946
So how's this done?


694
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,966
Okay. So NSURLSession is an
API that we introduced back


695
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:42,596
in iOS 7, and the
use is to upload


696
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:44,956
and download data
from your own server.


697
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:47,676
And this is intended
for large data sets.


698
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:52,176
So game levels, big images,
sound files, texture atlases,


699
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:53,565
all that kind of thing, right.


700
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:58,046
Now, the transfer, itself,
happens outside of your process.


701
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:58,996
You just set it off.


702
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,096
You'll get notified
when it's completed.


703
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:04,116
The player can continue
or the app can even be,


704
00:35:04,116 --> 00:35:05,946
you know, quit or terminated.


705
00:35:05,946 --> 00:35:07,986
And the download is
going to keep on going.


706
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:11,276
And the app, if it's
running, will be notified,


707
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,726
or it'll be woken up when
the transfer is done.


708
00:35:15,136 --> 00:35:18,236
And it's just enough so that you
can take the content that's been


709
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:21,156
downloaded and, kind
of, unpack it and put it


710
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:22,666
into its permanent location.


711
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:24,646
So it's really useful.


712
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:28,456
It does obviously, it adds
some complexity, right.


713
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:30,926
Because you're going to have
to handle some corner cases now


714
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,736
that you didn't have before,
like the player running


715
00:35:33,736 --> 00:35:37,646
out of disk space or, you
know, reaching a level


716
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:39,866
that you haven't
successfully downloaded yet.


717
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:42,346
And it's important, also,


718
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:44,806
that you follow the iOS
Data Storage Guidelines.


719
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,996
So these will tell you exactly


720
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:49,986
where to put any
downloaded assets.


721
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:55,416
And also remember, this is about
assets, you know, new textures,


722
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:59,166
new levels, new sounds, and that
kind of thing, but not code.


723
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,256
If you're making code
changes, that has to go back


724
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:05,206
up through app review
as an update to the app.


725
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:09,236
But, okay, so that's number six:
to use background transfers.


726
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:13,316
And, you know, if you're going
to be targeting iOS 7 and above,


727
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:16,596
like now is the time, right,
because you can move cleanly


728
00:36:16,596 --> 00:36:22,026
up to all of your supported
devices with NSURLSession.


729
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:27,176
Okay, number seven: optimize
graphics performance.


730
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:29,656
So, you know, I've
mentioned I meet


731
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:30,896
with developers all the time.


732
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,896
I probably met with some
of the people in this room.


733
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,876
And, you know, to give people
feedback on their games,


734
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:40,806
but one of the things that just
very, very honestly that I love


735
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:43,446
to do is to run their game


736
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:47,146
through our performance tools
and, kind of, use that to figure


737
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:52,596
out what optimizations they need
to make in OpenGL and so on.


738
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:55,176
It's kind of what I eat
for breakfast, right.


739
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:59,546
Now, so as I get into this
section, though, the first thing


740
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:02,266
to realize and to
say about it is


741
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:07,256
that optimizing graphics is
totally what Metal is all about.


742
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,076
But I'll get to Metal
in a second.


743
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:12,566
I want to talk first just
about optimizing the games


744
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,686
that are already out there.


745
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,846
So, you know, every game
is different, right,


746
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:21,466
and most of them are actually
pretty well optimized.


747
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:22,036
They're okay.


748
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:26,866
But in the games that are having
performance issues with OpenGL,


749
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:30,666
it's usually because for some
portion of the frame, at least,


750
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,646
or maybe all of the frame,
they're trying to do a lot


751
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:36,786
of draw calls with a
low number of triangles


752
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:38,806
to be processed in
each draw call.


753
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:45,116
And the worst case scenario
is actually fairly common.


754
00:37:45,116 --> 00:37:46,096
I see it sometimes.


755
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:49,056
It's particularly in
2D and isometric games


756
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:50,356
that I'll find this sometimes.


757
00:37:50,716 --> 00:37:52,466
Is that they're just,
they're in a loop


758
00:37:52,466 --> 00:37:55,966
where they're binding a texture,
drawing a quad, and then repeat.


759
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:57,506
Bind; draw; bind;
draw; bind; draw.


760
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:01,656
And that's how they draw their
entire scene with one draw call


761
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:04,786
for every quad, one texture
bind for every draw call.


762
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:08,376
And, you know, for
OpenGL ES, there's just,


763
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:12,046
there's a fair amount of CPU
overhead that's involved here


764
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:15,276
in the validation and the
processing draw calls.


765
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:19,166
So, you know, the theory behind
this becomes very important


766
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:20,746
to optimize this.


767
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:24,356
It's super important that
those developers find a way


768
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:28,036
to amortize that overhead
over more triangles.


769
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:33,066
Now, this is something that
I can help any of you with,


770
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:36,996
and we have tons of people
in the lab this week.


771
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:40,576
So if you're falling into this
situation, we can help you.


772
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:44,816
But these 15 recommendations
that are up here cover most


773
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:46,446
of the cases that I run into.


774
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:50,616
This is the solutions that we
apply depending on the game,


775
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:55,016
depending on the structure, and
what they're doing in OpenGL.


776
00:38:56,556 --> 00:38:59,286
But, and I'm not going to
go deep into any of these.


777
00:38:59,476 --> 00:39:03,426
But, so, more broadly,
what you need to realize is


778
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:07,436
that optimizing graphics
performance is really


779
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:12,426
and primarily about identifying
the bottlenecks that you have


780
00:39:12,426 --> 00:39:15,786
and then addressing them, taking
some action to address them.


781
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:19,496
Okay, so that lets me
talk about the tools.


782
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:21,706
You know, we have
these fantastic tools


783
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:25,126
that will help you
identify exactly


784
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:27,076
where your performance
bottlenecks are


785
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:28,966
and different bottlenecks
that might be happening.


786
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:33,306
So this is a screenshot from the
GPU performance graphs in Xcode.


787
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:38,026
And this, along with the
GPU frame debugger in Xcode


788
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:40,636
and the OpenGL ES
analyzer instrument,


789
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,436
are kind of the tools
of the trade


790
00:39:42,436 --> 00:39:44,366
that you should familiarize
yourself with here.


791
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,156
So now let me zoom in.


792
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:50,386
So what you see here: Section
at the top you see this sort


793
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:53,506
of speedometer on the left up
at the top, the purple bars


794
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:55,826
with utilization in the
middle that's showing me my


795
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,256
GPU utilization.


796
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:59,796
And then over here on the
right, the frame time,


797
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:03,176
or how much time the CPU
is working on this frame,


798
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:05,306
and how much time the GPU
is working on this frame.


799
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:09,406
Now, in this particular
screenshot,


800
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:12,266
this is a little different
than what I was just talking


801
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:14,786
about with bind, draw,
bind, draw, bind, draw.


802
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:18,376
In this one, what it is, I can
see the renderer utilization is


803
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,626
at 100 percent and that's
pushing the device utilization


804
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:22,636
up to 100 percent.


805
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:25,246
And that is typically
a sign actually


806
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:26,996
of a very expensive
fragment shader.


807
00:40:27,436 --> 00:40:30,736
Okay. And so down in the
bottom here, you can see,


808
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:36,526
a view here now where I can-it's
showing me the cost of every one


809
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:38,656
of my shaders that was
used in this frame.


810
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,266
And I can turn down
these disclosures


811
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:44,736
and see the specific draw
calls that use that shader


812
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,836
and how much each one
of them cost as well.


813
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,946
And, then, I can
also go and drill


814
00:40:50,946 --> 00:40:52,656
down into a particular shader.


815
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:54,366
I'm not going to walk
you through all the UI.


816
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:57,426
But once you get to the
view where you're looking


817
00:40:57,426 --> 00:41:00,426
that your shaders, if
I zoom that in again.


818
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:05,066
Okay. So what this
is showing me now,


819
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:07,856
look at on the right hand
side, these little bars.


820
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:11,086
This is taken live
from the device.


821
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:13,056
It's able to see the
performance data.


822
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:16,046
And it's going line by
line through the shader


823
00:41:16,046 --> 00:41:18,686
to show you the performance
cost of each line.


824
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:22,596
And so here I see that,
okay, 59 percent of the cost


825
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:25,936
of this shader was going
into shadow projection.


826
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:27,926
And that's probably
something I can optimize.


827
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:30,206
I can use a lower resolution
shadow map or something.


828
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:33,886
Because, remember, this was
the most expensive shader


829
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:34,466
in the app.


830
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,776
And the renderer utilization
was at 100 percent.


831
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:41,616
So this is the bottleneck,
this shadow projection.


832
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:43,646
And so it's exactly
what, in this case,


833
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,156
needs to be optimized out.


834
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:48,556
But, so the point, though,
is that the tools can be used


835
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:52,026
to exactly pinpoint what's
going on in your app.


836
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,976
Now, you know, if you're
not familiar with the tool


837
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:58,546
or this isn't something that
you know your way around yet,


838
00:41:58,546 --> 00:41:59,606
just come down to the labs.


839
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:01,866
We have so many people
down there who would love


840
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:03,996
to help you to suss this out.


841
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:07,086
But so, obviously, there's
an opportunity here, right,


842
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:11,486
for OpenGL ES-based games to
kind of use the tools, optimize


843
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:12,706
and get better performance.


844
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:15,676
But I also want to be
super clear, you know,


845
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:20,316
that seeing so many developers
struggle and face these kinds


846
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:24,176
of issues are a big part
of the reason why SpriteKit


847
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:26,396
and SceneKit were
developed, right.


848
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:28,826
Their purpose is to provide you


849
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:30,916
with the capabilities
that you need, right?


850
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:34,876
2D games with SpriteKit,
3D games with SceneKit.


851
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:38,116
Or now they can be
mixed together, right.


852
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:41,546
But the real key is that
once you're using them


853
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:43,726
and taking advantage
of their feature set,


854
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:48,926
they take on the burden of
rendering optimally in OpenGL.


855
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:50,716
And you don't have to
worry about it anymore.


856
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,726
And, if you think about it,
one more step, you know,


857
00:42:54,726 --> 00:42:58,766
since Apple provides the
entire technology stack


858
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:02,836
from these APIs all the
way down to the hardware,


859
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:06,936
it means that everything can
be made very optimal in a way


860
00:43:06,936 --> 00:43:08,356
that you don't have to work on.


861
00:43:08,896 --> 00:43:13,156
And then, okay, speaking
of optimal, right.


862
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:15,246
Now there's Metal, right.


863
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:19,296
So this, this is for those
of you with games or engines


864
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,546
that need to push a
lot more draw calls.


865
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:27,156
And really allow your code
to have very efficient access


866
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:31,576
to the GPU to interleave
graphics and compute, and so on.


867
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,286
And really take control yourself


868
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:35,616
over how the frame
is being rendered.


869
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:39,546
So that is number seven:
optimize graphics performance.


870
00:43:41,326 --> 00:43:44,256
Okay, number eight: now,
we're lifting out of the tech


871
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:46,206
in just a couple of
really kind of quick


872
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,826
and light bits of advice here.


873
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:50,136
This is a super quick one.


874
00:43:50,346 --> 00:43:52,526
It's to make a great
gameplay video.


875
00:43:52,946 --> 00:43:54,356
You know, so earlier
in the talk,


876
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:55,386
I talked about the importance


877
00:43:55,386 --> 00:43:57,476
of making a really
great first impression.


878
00:43:57,796 --> 00:44:00,176
But what I didn't
really get into then was


879
00:44:00,176 --> 00:44:01,876
that from the user's
perspective,


880
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:04,496
your player's perspective,
all of that is going


881
00:44:04,496 --> 00:44:05,896
to start on the App Store.


882
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:09,186
And, you know, as we talked
about yesterday, you know,


883
00:44:09,186 --> 00:44:11,326
when people are really
coming on to the App Store,


884
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:13,536
they're looking for
something that's cool and new.


885
00:44:13,536 --> 00:44:16,806
You know, they're going to be
looking for some way to kind


886
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:19,396
of understand what
your game is doing.


887
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:22,856
And you want to have something
that's going to stand out


888
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:25,426
and exactly explain it.


889
00:44:25,946 --> 00:44:28,266
And so that they'll
be more confident


890
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,386
and more ready to get your game.


891
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,066
Okay. Now, as we talked
about a little bit yesterday,


892
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:37,226
so in iOS 8, OS X
Yosemite, you'll be able


893
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:39,556
to create these short
app previews


894
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:41,626
or game previews
to demo your game.


895
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:44,516
You should use this to show
how the game is played.


896
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,156
You know, use it.


897
00:44:45,446 --> 00:44:48,316
Tell a story with
this and really appeal


898
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:50,736
to what makes the
gameplay so much fun.


899
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:54,686
You know, here's how it'll look
when it's on the App Store.


900
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:58,146
We showed this "Monument
Valley" example yesterday.


901
00:44:58,146 --> 00:45:03,226
And how it works is just
the app preview just appears


902
00:45:03,696 --> 00:45:06,326
as the first image there
along with the screenshot.


903
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:09,286
User taps on that, and they
can see this gameplay video.


904
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:11,996
But now some details about this.


905
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,926
Okay. So the app preview
needs to be, you know,


906
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:17,276
a video of your gameplay.


907
00:45:17,276 --> 00:45:19,096
It's not intended to be an ad.


908
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:23,086
It should convey the real
experience of playing the game.


909
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:26,136
It can be up to 30 seconds long.


910
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:30,846
You provide it as an H.264,
you know, MPEG4 encoded file


911
00:45:30,846 --> 00:45:32,506
that you upload into
iTunes Connect.


912
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:36,136
You can have, or you should
have a different video


913
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:38,126
for iPhone versus iPad.


914
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:43,136
And your content itself can
be captured directly off


915
00:45:43,136 --> 00:45:47,216
of your iOS device and onto
your Mac that's running OS


916
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:47,976
X Yosemite.


917
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:51,346
The Mac just sees the iOS
device as a video camera.


918
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,096
And you start playing the game,


919
00:45:53,096 --> 00:45:55,596
and you can capture it using
whatever tool you like:


920
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:57,806
Quicktime Player, and so on.


921
00:45:57,806 --> 00:45:59,876
iMovie is where you
can do your editing.


922
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:01,626
And then just put it
all together and get it


923
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,746
up on iTunes Connect,
and you're ready to go.


924
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:07,636
And then this is really
just sort of one piece


925
00:46:07,636 --> 00:46:11,706
of building a great App
Store presence, right.


926
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:14,956
So having a great icon,
compelling screenshots,


927
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:19,506
localizations, description,
your keywords, and so on.


928
00:46:20,016 --> 00:46:23,066
Okay. So about app previews,
there's a whole session


929
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:25,426
on it that's also on
Thursday afternoon.


930
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:27,176
Check your schedule to see that.


931
00:46:28,366 --> 00:46:32,236
And make a great video
that's going to show players


932
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:35,136
who are interested in your
game what the gameplay is


933
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:35,626
really like.


934
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,936
Okay. Number nine
is to localize.


935
00:46:40,836 --> 00:46:43,466
You know the App Store
is a global business.


936
00:46:43,856 --> 00:46:49,156
It's available in 155 countries
in 40 languages, right.


937
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:53,456
So this, this is an opportunity
that is just phenomenal


938
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,466
and you should think globally.


939
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:57,956
You know, you need to think
about the distribution


940
00:46:57,956 --> 00:47:00,676
of your game as a
global opportunity.


941
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:05,026
Now, so the first thing
that you should do,


942
00:47:05,026 --> 00:47:06,746
if you haven't already
done this,


943
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:10,476
is to localize your App
Store presence, right.


944
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:15,346
Just so that when a player in
some other region is coming in


945
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:17,856
and looking at your game,
it just stands to reason


946
00:47:17,856 --> 00:47:19,996
that they'll be more
interested in it


947
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:23,166
if they can read the description
of these other things


948
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,996
in their native language, right.


949
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:28,936
So localize the name, the
description, the keywords,


950
00:47:29,176 --> 00:47:32,826
the snapshots, and so on, right.


951
00:47:32,826 --> 00:47:35,606
And then the second
piece of this, of course,


952
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:37,856
is to localize the
app content itself.


953
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:42,556
So by that I mean to really go
back and structure your game


954
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:44,136
for internationalization.


955
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:46,216
You'll need to do what
you can to separate text


956
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:48,856
from artwork and texture.


957
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:51,446
So you don't have to
make copies of big images


958
00:47:51,446 --> 00:47:53,156
for every language
that you support.


959
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:55,706
And then go through your UI.


960
00:47:56,366 --> 00:47:57,646
And, of course, right.


961
00:47:57,646 --> 00:48:00,326
And translate the text into
all the different languages


962
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:01,876
that you want to support.


963
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:05,226
And then, finally, you
know, also, consider things


964
00:48:05,226 --> 00:48:07,106
like whether your game is right


965
00:48:07,106 --> 00:48:10,286
to provide some culturalized
content


966
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:11,906
where it would be appropriate.


967
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:14,336
For example, if it
was a driving game,


968
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:16,596
maybe you would use
local road signs


969
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:18,326
for different locales and so on.


970
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:20,796
Local license plates
from different locales.


971
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:27,466
So, now, here's a list
of some of the languages


972
00:48:27,466 --> 00:48:29,546
that we've recommended before.


973
00:48:29,546 --> 00:48:31,466
It's certainly not exhaustive.


974
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:32,826
It's a big list.


975
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:34,746
And it's a good place
to start though.


976
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:38,046
So first is EFIGS,
right: English, French,


977
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:39,246
Italian, German, Spanish.


978
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:44,786
Then many regions in Asia, so
Japanese, Korean, Traditional


979
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:47,616
and Simplified Chinese, and
then branches out from there.


980
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:50,146
So Brazilian, Portuguese,
Russian, Turkish,


981
00:48:50,146 --> 00:48:53,036
and Arabic are what
we would recommend


982
00:48:53,036 --> 00:48:54,596
that you really put
some focus into.


983
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:57,796
And there's a great
resource online:


984
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,696
developer.apple.com/
internationalization.


985
00:49:01,156 --> 00:49:03,876
So this will take you step
by step through the process


986
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:07,326
of internationalizing and
localizing your app, your game.


987
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:12,486
And it gives you some links to
third party localization vendors


988
00:49:12,486 --> 00:49:15,186
if you don't have that
expertise in-house.


989
00:49:16,176 --> 00:49:19,096
But, so that is number
nine: to localize.


990
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:24,056
And so number 10: to
target the state of the art.


991
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:29,626
So if you think about some of
the best games that are on iOS,


992
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:32,686
you know, a real common
thread, as we've been saying,


993
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:35,466
is how they consistently
aim high


994
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:38,936
and consistently target
the latest and greatest


995
00:49:39,006 --> 00:49:41,546
to differentiate
themselves on our devices.


996
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:46,956
So to be state-of-the-art
means really taking advantage


997
00:49:46,956 --> 00:49:48,036
of the capabilities


998
00:49:48,036 --> 00:49:50,896
of the latest hardware
like the A7, right.


999
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:54,226
And target the feature
set of those devices


1000
00:49:54,226 --> 00:49:55,866
so that you stand out.


1001
00:49:56,496 --> 00:50:00,566
I mean, you guys, you saw
those demos yesterday, right,


1002
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:02,366
during the "Keynote",
the "State of the Union".


1003
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:04,686
They were on this hardware.


1004
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:08,316
You know, you've
seen what it can do.


1005
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:11,686
So take advantage
of that, that power,


1006
00:50:11,726 --> 00:50:14,626
that capability that's there.


1007
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:17,616
Then hand in hand with
that, is that state


1008
00:50:17,616 --> 00:50:21,566
of the art apps support
the latest versions of iOS.


1009
00:50:22,816 --> 00:50:26,616
And I think that this week
should be that turning point


1010
00:50:26,616 --> 00:50:31,346
for you where it's time now for
you to realign your projects


1011
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:36,376
to aim for the release of iOS 8
and the APIs and the frameworks


1012
00:50:36,376 --> 00:50:38,646
that you'll be learning
about all this week.


1013
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:42,586
And then bring your
minimum OS up to iOS 7.


1014
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:44,736
That is our recommendation.


1015
00:50:44,736 --> 00:50:47,776
Support the latest
N and N minus 1.


1016
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:51,396
So when iOS 8 is released,
you'll probably want


1017
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:53,116
to be looking at 7 and 8.


1018
00:50:54,276 --> 00:50:58,776
Okay. Now something, you know,
something that we do hear


1019
00:50:58,776 --> 00:51:01,346
from developers, actually more
often than you might think,


1020
00:51:01,346 --> 00:51:05,886
is that they're telling us
that they'll, they're deciding


1021
00:51:05,886 --> 00:51:08,716
to stick with an older version
of Xcode or an older SDK


1022
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:12,716
because they think that if
they move up to what's latest,


1023
00:51:13,106 --> 00:51:15,006
they won't be able
to still ship a game


1024
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:17,336
that supports anything
older than that.


1025
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:20,356
But obviously that's
not the case.


1026
00:51:21,066 --> 00:51:24,886
So you can adopt the latest SDK
version by setting your base SDK


1027
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:29,026
to what is current and then
setting your deployment target


1028
00:51:29,026 --> 00:51:32,746
down to the lowest OS version
that you want to support


1029
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,016
and dropping support
for the rest.


1030
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:39,286
And then handle differences
between 7 and 8 in your code.


1031
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:40,826
You know, check for
the existence


1032
00:51:41,146 --> 00:51:42,666
of hardware capabilities.


1033
00:51:42,996 --> 00:51:45,116
Or check whether
classes are defined.


1034
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:47,086
Or check whether classes respond


1035
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:49,016
to a particular selector
and so on.


1036
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:52,116
Now for those of you who
are coming over to iOS


1037
00:51:52,116 --> 00:51:55,156
and are just not as
familiar with that process,


1038
00:51:55,296 --> 00:51:57,986
we actually went through
it all in pretty good depth


1039
00:51:58,556 --> 00:52:02,566
when we went out for our iOS
7 Tech Talks last November,


1040
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:03,056
December.


1041
00:52:03,556 --> 00:52:06,926
And so those videos are online
on our developer website.


1042
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:08,566
So you should check them out.


1043
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:12,946
Then also, state of the
art games are the ones


1044
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:15,876
that integrate with our
built in game technologies


1045
00:52:16,536 --> 00:52:19,186
as Geoff talked about.


1046
00:52:20,026 --> 00:52:24,186
So we're providing just this
incredible foundation for you.


1047
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:27,866
It's built on a lot of different
APIs, you know, like SpriteKit,


1048
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:32,446
Game Center, OpenGL, and
Game Controllers and so on.


1049
00:52:32,446 --> 00:52:36,426
And then the new APIs, like
Metal and SceneKit on iOS.


1050
00:52:37,316 --> 00:52:40,006
Right. And these are just
a few of the technologies.


1051
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:40,976
You know this.


1052
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:45,056
But the point I want to make
is about the other things.


1053
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:48,746
You know, the tools and the
APIs that are available to you


1054
00:52:48,746 --> 00:52:52,606
as game developers is
comprehensive on iOS.


1055
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,966
And you should learn
the entire stack.


1056
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:59,056
Oh, my god, that's a
lot of learning to do.


1057
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:02,676
But really what I mean is
to familiarize yourself


1058
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:06,066
with the technologies
that are on iOS rather


1059
00:53:06,066 --> 00:53:09,536
than just taking a project
that you were working on,


1060
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:12,916
maybe on another platform
or on an older OS version,


1061
00:53:13,076 --> 00:53:16,526
and just shifting that over and
fitting it into the equivalent.


1062
00:53:17,116 --> 00:53:20,676
Your target should be to go
for the latest and greatest.


1063
00:53:20,736 --> 00:53:24,586
Target the top, target the
state of the art, target the A7,


1064
00:53:24,586 --> 00:53:28,236
target iOS 8 and its
capabilities, right,


1065
00:53:28,896 --> 00:53:31,766
rather than just coming
over and just fitting


1066
00:53:31,986 --> 00:53:33,806
in with something that's older.


1067
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:38,066
But, so that's number 10:
target the state of the art.


1068
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:40,796
But before I finish, I
do have one more thing


1069
00:53:40,796 --> 00:53:42,476
that I want to talk about.


1070
00:53:43,706 --> 00:53:47,346
So you know let's say that
you've done all 10 of these.


1071
00:53:47,346 --> 00:53:51,496
You've fixed your onboarding,
you tuned up your Core Loop,


1072
00:53:51,496 --> 00:53:53,036
you're optimized,
you're localized,


1073
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:55,416
you're state-of-the-art,
etc., all 10.


1074
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,856
So where do you go from here?


1075
00:53:59,076 --> 00:54:01,696
Yeah, well, go to 11.


1076
00:54:02,796 --> 00:54:05,506
Really, give it that extra push.


1077
00:54:06,216 --> 00:54:07,686
Go the extra mile.


1078
00:54:08,126 --> 00:54:10,496
Because here is my
observation about this,


1079
00:54:11,226 --> 00:54:12,996
you know: We keep innovating.


1080
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:16,066
We keep enhancing our
game technologies.


1081
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:19,306
And we have this
thriving ecosystem, right,


1082
00:54:19,586 --> 00:54:20,716
where we're investing.


1083
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:23,946
We're adding performance,
and we're adding capability.


1084
00:54:24,446 --> 00:54:26,566
You guys, you can't stand still.


1085
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:28,246
Keep inventing.


1086
00:54:28,576 --> 00:54:29,346
Keep learning.


1087
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:30,506
Keep current.


1088
00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:35,546
Get started on that next update
for iOS 8, and keep up with us


1089
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:39,426
because we love to shine
the spotlight on developers


1090
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:42,086
who can go one louder.


1091
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:43,536
All right.


1092
00:54:44,056 --> 00:54:45,216
So thank you, everyone.


1093
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:46,926
That is my list.


1094
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:52,986
[ Applause ]


1095
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:57,706
And just to wrap things up,
I'd like to pass the stage back


1096
00:54:57,706 --> 00:54:59,076
to Geoff for just a moment.


1097
00:54:59,076 --> 00:54:59,876
So thank you.


1098
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:07,326
>> Thank you, Allan.


1099
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,906
So thank you very much, Allan.


1100
00:55:11,226 --> 00:55:15,566
And I think, when I step
back and look at this,


1101
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:16,686
we see a tremendous
amount of games.


1102
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:18,116
You look around the room;
there's a lot of you


1103
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:19,586
who are interested
in building games.


1104
00:55:19,906 --> 00:55:22,376
And there's a large number
of games in the App Store.


1105
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:25,386
We're talking about how you
can make your game stand out.


1106
00:55:25,746 --> 00:55:27,746
It isn't good enough to
just go, "Oh, I'm going to.


1107
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:28,396
I have a great idea.


1108
00:55:28,976 --> 00:55:29,596
It's a cool game.


1109
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:32,316
I'm going to toss it up onto the
App Store and see what happens."


1110
00:55:32,316 --> 00:55:35,976
It is a very big pond, so
use what Allan has told you.


1111
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:38,116
Use these 10 steps,
and use the 11th step.


1112
00:55:39,346 --> 00:55:41,216
And really make your game shine.


1113
00:55:41,656 --> 00:55:44,196
These are the things which may
not be apparent when you look


1114
00:55:44,196 --> 00:55:45,696
at it, it may not be
apparent when you look


1115
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:48,976
at the Design Awards Winners
that they do these things.


1116
00:55:48,976 --> 00:55:51,116
But they really do, they
spend a lot of time.


1117
00:55:51,536 --> 00:55:52,816
"Cut the Rope" was
a great example.


1118
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:55,916
Spent a lot of time on
going through with people


1119
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:58,366
who haven't played the
game before and say, "Hey,


1120
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:01,656
when you approach the game
what do you need to know?"


1121
00:56:01,876 --> 00:56:03,996
It's not just like that
came to them in an hour.


1122
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:05,786
So take the time with your game.


1123
00:56:06,106 --> 00:56:07,666
Take the time to
go that extra mile.


1124
00:56:08,046 --> 00:56:10,856
Take the time to adopt
these 10 items and the 11th


1125
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:14,326
and really bring your
content up so it stands out.


1126
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:17,106
And we really hope to
see someone in this room


1127
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:19,836
or many people in this
room on stage next year


1128
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:20,846
at the Apple Design Awards.


1129
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:22,446
Thank you very much
and enjoy the week.
