3
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,926
>> Hello everyone, I'm Julian,


4
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:36,716
later we'll be joined by Hugo


5
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,956
who designs sounds across our


6
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:39,516
products.


7
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:42,246
Before we begin I wanted to


8
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:44,126
explain a little bit about why


9
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:45,056
we're going to be talking about


10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,316
a button for a while here.


11
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:51,136
I design and prototype user


12
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:52,896
interfaces for future hardware.


13
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:55,526
Because of the nature of my work


14
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,256
I can't always use standard


15
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:57,806
UIKit.


16
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,606
I have built and rebuilt a lot


17
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:03,366
of basic user interface elements


18
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:06,306
like scrolling, zooming, paging,


19
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:08,536
and of course buttons and I've


20
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:11,216
learned a lot about the details


21
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:13,436
involved in designing and


22
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:14,446
building these controls.


23
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,426
So I'm here to share a little


24
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:20,446
bit about what I've learned with


25
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:20,766
you.


26
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:23,356
I want to show you how something


27
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:27,126
so simple, a button, has a lot


28
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:29,206
of consideration and complexity


29
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,396
behind it.


30
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:32,926
And I hope that through looking


31
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,326
at this button you can learn a


32
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:34,826
few things.


33
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:38,396
I want you to use standard


34
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,676
controls more thoughtfully.


35
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,256
To consider when to build your


36
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:44,286
own custom controls.


37
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:46,846
And when you do build custom


38
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:49,336
controls I want you to consider


39
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:50,846
your interactions all the way


40
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:51,216
through.


41
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:53,456
So let's get started.


42
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:58,586
Hugo and I are expanding our


43
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,676
artisanal toast app empire.


44
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:05,446
We are building a new simpler


45
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:08,346
app that is connected to a


46
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:08,846
toaster.


47
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,966
If you imagine for a moment


48
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,066
you're getting ready in the


49
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,596
morning, you want to make sure


50
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:17,266
you have breakfast ready by the


51
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,386
time you're heading out the


52
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:18,706
door.


53
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:21,886
All you have to do is launch our


54
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:24,496
app, press a button and expect a


55
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:26,316
fresh piece of toast waiting for


56
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:29,486
you in your kitchen.


57
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,286
Now this works with our


58
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:33,516
connected toaster.


59
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:35,256
Our connected toaster goes


60
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,956
through a few different states,


61
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,886
it's ready and waiting for a new


62
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:41,346
piece of toast, it's making


63
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,236
toast, and finally the toast is


64
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:44,176
done, the important part.


65
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:46,936
But the way that our connected


66
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:48,226
toaster ends up transitioning


67
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:51,436
between these states is people


68
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:52,866
using our app.


69
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:55,496
When they use our app they can


70
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:57,796
request a piece of toast to


71
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:58,876
start the toaster going.


72
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:02,386
When the toast is done they will


73
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:04,136
of course eat it.


74
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,456
Maybe for some reason they'd


75
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,436
want to cancel it, I'm not


76
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,316
really sure about this one.


77
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:09,806
And of course we want to make


78
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,316
sure our toaster is always ready


79
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:11,976
to serve.


80
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:13,686
I'm not going to disclose


81
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:15,296
exactly how this works but trust


82
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:18,276
me it does and it's great.


83
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:20,196
We also have big plans for the


84
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:22,526
future, we could have AR toast,


85
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:24,366
queues of toast, multiple


86
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,976
toasters per household, and


87
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,166
eventually we'll connect this


88
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,456
back up to our toast social


89
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:28,826
network.


90
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:31,536
My point is there's a lot going


91
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:36,566
on in here and for today's


92
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,576
session we're going to dive deep


93
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,216
into the details of a single


94
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:42,986
screen, in fact a single button


95
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:47,186
on a single screen of our app.


96
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:48,786
If we get to the details of our


97
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,746
most important interaction right


98
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,176
the rest will flow from it.


99
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,646
So if we look at our system


100
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:59,276
again I think the most important


101
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,936
interaction here is actually


102
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:04,066
when we request toast.


103
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,386
Obviously, all the rest of this


104
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,496
has to work, but requesting


105
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,936
toast is the first impression


106
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,776
and if people aren't able to


107
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,396
start the toaster the rest of it


108
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:12,976
doesn't really matter.


109
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:20,466
So to do this today we're going


110
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,666
to start by talking a little bit


111
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,506
about what a button is, then I'm


112
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,096
going to share with you a way of


113
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,456
thinking about interactive


114
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:29,076
controls.


115
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,396
And finally, Hugo will join us


116
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,786
at add some sound to our Button.


117
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,406
So what is a button anyway?


118
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:42,566
The buttons that we are talking


119
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:45,396
about today or onscreen user


120
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:46,496
interface controls.


121
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:50,636
Buttons are indirect controllers


122
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:51,136
of action.


123
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,796
What I mean by this is when you


124
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,556
tap a button the action happens


125
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:58,456
somewhere else.


126
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:01,766
This is as opposed to a direct


127
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,936
interaction where here I'm


128
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:06,036
grabbing the lever and


129
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,576
controlling the lever directly.


130
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:11,316
Direct interactions can


131
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:12,586
reference the real-world


132
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,806
experience and feel more fun.


133
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:18,046
But the real power of indirect


134
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:19,766
interactions like buttons is


135
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:20,996
that they can be clearer and


136
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,886
more powerful because of their


137
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:23,656
separation.


138
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:26,866
The interesting thing here being


139
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,726
that even the physical buttons


140
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,036
that these onscreen buttons are


141
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,946
imitating are indirect.


142
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,916
Even though the action, the


143
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,916
result is happening somewhere


144
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,416
else the button controls that


145
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:43,876
action.


146
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:45,886
And just like the action a


147
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:48,356
result can be designed a button


148
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,066
can be designed, we can consider


149
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,726
both of these things separately


150
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,646
and connected.


151
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:57,116
To do this today we're going to


152
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:59,556
be relying heavily on a single


153
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:02,796
lens of design feedback.


154
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,766
Feedback is how you let people


155
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,976
know what your app is doing.


156
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,256
I'm sure a lot of you have


157
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:13,336
thought of a variety of


158
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:15,326
different ways that you can


159
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:16,436
provide feedback within your


160
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,126
apps and are already doing so.


161
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:22,226
But I think there are two major


162
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:23,666
categories of feedback.


163
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,366
The first is that you can tell


164
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:29,766
people, you can literally put


165
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,676
text on screen explaining what's


166
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:34,206
going on or design icons that


167
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:34,916
explain things.


168
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:38,946
The second is that you can show


169
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,326
people, you can allow people to


170
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,736
experience the results of their


171
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,056
action more like the real world


172
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,766
through visual, audio or even


173
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,866
haptic change over time.


174
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:56,836
Now we're going to apply


175
00:06:56,836 --> 00:07:00,726
feedback to three phases of an


176
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:04,216
interaction, not just its


177
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:04,766
completion.


178
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:07,196
We can think of these phases in


179
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:08,706
terms of a physical button.


180
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,986
Before I have pressed the button


181
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:17,616
it's just hanging out there.


182
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:19,446
During my interaction with that


183
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,346
button it's being pressed in.


184
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:26,166
And finally after I've pressed


185
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,836
that button my finger is lifting


186
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:28,986
off of it and it's returning to


187
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:29,836
its original state.


188
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:36,036
So what does it even mean to be


189
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:39,086
providing feedback before I have


190
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:41,086
begun interacting with a button,


191
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,406
why does this even matter, the


192
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,586
button's just there right.


193
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,636
Well if we think about our


194
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,466
iPhones for a moment, the iPhone


195
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,076
screen is just a piece of glass.


196
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,446
This piece of glass happens to


197
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:56,056
have glowing pixels underneath


198
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:58,626
it and what matters is what


199
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:00,356
people think those pixels mean.


200
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,166
Glass doesn't tell you that it's


201
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,856
tappable, but something on


202
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:07,396
screen might.


203
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:10,076
You could see that you could


204
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:13,456
page through something, drag


205
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:16,346
something or of course for the


206
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:17,546
purposes of this presentation


207
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:18,476
tap on something.


208
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:23,686
The academic term for what I'm


209
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,416
talking about is perceived


210
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,196
affordance.


211
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:28,766
Affordance refers to the


212
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:31,716
connection between an object and


213
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,336
the person interacting with it.


214
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:35,395
A person might know that they


215
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,496
can grab a handle or press in on


216
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,296
a physical button.


217
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,525
But the perceived part of this


218
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:42,876
is talking about what people


219
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:45,106
know about those glowing pixels


220
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:45,766
on screen.


221
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:47,556
People only know what they can


222
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:49,036
interact with on that iPhone


223
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,986
screen because of their prior


224
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:53,036
experience having used iOS


225
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,376
before and their current


226
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,886
context, the fact that they're


227
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:59,276
on this phone in an app that


228
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:00,926
they may or may not understand.


229
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:05,956
So let's apply this to our toast


230
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,466
app of course.


231
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,526
How do I know what will happen


232
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,046
when I tap this button, I just


233
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:13,616
put a button up and call it okay


234
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:14,526
right, no.


235
00:09:14,696 --> 00:09:18,926
What we do is provide a label, a


236
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,486
label is feedback in which you


237
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:23,376
are telling people literally


238
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:24,436
what is going to happen.


239
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,896
In this particular case I tried


240
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:29,406
the label toast, but


241
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:31,176
unfortunately toast refers to


242
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:32,946
both the verb to toast and it


243
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,736
also refers to the delicious


244
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:35,436
piece of bread you're going to


245
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:36,406
be eating for breakfast.


246
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:38,666
So what should we call this


247
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,016
label, toast toast?


248
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,576
No. We could try to design an


249
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:47,196
icon for this button but I think


250
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,506
this isn't particularly clear,


251
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,566
especially for something that


252
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:50,876
people will be encountering for


253
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:52,586
the first time in an unfamiliar


254
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:53,116
context.


255
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,176
So we thought about it a little


256
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:56,366
bit and we came up with the


257
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:57,766
phrase make toast.


258
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:00,056
I know that in our diagram we


259
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:01,576
refer to this as request toast


260
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:03,066
but we spent some time thinking


261
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:06,316
about what people using our app


262
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:08,896
might understand and what feels


263
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:09,976
most comfortable for our app.


264
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:15,256
The next thing to think about is


265
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:16,576
how do I even know that this is


266
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,566
a button, just a rectangle


267
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,726
floating on a black background


268
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,646
might not be enough.


269
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,606
But if you add some context like


270
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:27,216
an iPhone screen you might start


271
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,646
to understand it or you could


272
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:30,346
add some prior experience.


273
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,056
It could be the shape of the


274
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:34,966
button, the manner in which is


275
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:38,136
rendered or if it's used


276
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,726
consistently enough just the


277
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:43,006
color of text.


278
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:45,696
In this case, I don't think


279
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:46,706
people are going to be very


280
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:47,736
familiar with our app they're


281
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:48,826
going to be launching it once a


282
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:51,746
day, more if we're lucky so


283
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:52,886
we're going to focus on more


284
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,776
standard iOS button shapes


285
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,036
because we don't want to throw


286
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:56,656
in something new.


287
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,546
So we try these out on screen.


288
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,426
Another thing that we can think


289
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,356
about with respect to feedback


290
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:08,916
before we begin using this


291
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,636
button is how do I even know


292
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,206
what this button relates to.


293
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:13,856
It could be something about


294
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,916
where in the app a button is


295
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,686
located, these buttons have


296
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:18,726
different meaning and feel.


297
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:21,696
Or it could be something about


298
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,166
how it's grouped with other


299
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,666
controls or how close it is to


300
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,866
other objects on screen.


301
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,426
I'm starting to like this last


302
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,536
one here so we're going to try


303
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:35,086
it out on a real screen.


304
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:37,096
I drew this user interface in


305
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,106
Keynote and I put it on a phone


306
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:40,826
and I'm holding this phone in my


307
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,236
bedroom where I might expect to


308
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,056
use it in the morning before I


309
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:44,616
order toast.


310
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:45,306
And I'm just trying to


311
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:48,056
understand do I know what this


312
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:48,836
button will do.


313
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:53,836
The next thing we should think


314
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:57,096
about is what happens during my


315
00:11:57,096 --> 00:11:58,316
interaction with this button.


316
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,466
For a physical button I'd be


317
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:01,976
pressing it in.


318
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:12,056
Now the term feedback refers to


319
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:14,186
telling people something about


320
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:15,746
the result of what has happened


321
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,096
and in this case, we haven't


322
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:20,666
actually done anything yet, so


323
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,946
we might use the term


324
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:23,286
feedforward for this.


325
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:27,866
Because feedforward refers to


326
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,596
helping people understand what


327
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:32,886
is happening while they're


328
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,186
interacting with this button.


329
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,306
Feedforward is a component of


330
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,956
making interactions feel fluid,


331
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,976
you can convey responsiveness


332
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,756
for things like 3-D touch, pinch


333
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:46,886
or slide movements.


334
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:51,146
Thinking about how feedforward


335
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,776
applies to our button we should


336
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:55,126
be thinking about what is


337
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,966
happening now, what is happening


338
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:58,306
while my finger is making


339
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:00,256
contact with the screen, with


340
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:00,786
that button.


341
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:04,176
In the case of our overall toast


342
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:07,246
system we are in the middle of


343
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:08,726
touching a button to request


344
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:09,026
toast.


345
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:10,916
So the part we're going to focus


346
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,706
on is the toaster being ready


347
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,956
and eventually transitioning to


348
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,296
the toaster making toast.


349
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,716
We should be thinking about what


350
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,346
is happening and how I can hint


351
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:23,826
toward what will happen.


352
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,186
Let's say I've begun touching


353
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,826
this button, how do I know that


354
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:33,906
I've begun tapping this button,


355
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,356
why does it even matter?


356
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,896
Well, for one, the hit area of


357
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:39,866
this button might not be what


358
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,476
you expect, if you look closely


359
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:43,456
at the circle maybe I'm not


360
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,036
quite touching it.


361
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,796
But perhaps the hit area is


362
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:47,846
actually a little bit larger


363
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:49,866
than the visual size, this is


364
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,386
particularly important for very


365
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:52,756
small controls if we made that


366
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:53,676
lever interactive.


367
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,196
So how do I know I've begun


368
00:13:58,196 --> 00:13:58,966
tapping this button?


369
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:02,376
Well you might be tempted to


370
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,126
animate the button, to have it


371
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:07,096
fade in or grow very slowly, but


372
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:07,996
this can make things feel


373
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:08,826
unresponsive.


374
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,086
This kind of animation might be


375
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,506
appropriate for 3-D touch if


376
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:15,316
it's responding continuously as


377
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:16,026
I'm pressing in.


378
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,166
But for a quick contact with the


379
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,766
screen we might want to do


380
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:21,936
something faster, if we are


381
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:22,846
going to animate it do it very


382
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:23,206
quickly.


383
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:27,096
So what we do is provide a


384
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:30,056
confirmation sound, a haptic or


385
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:31,076
visual change.


386
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:32,696
In this case, we're just going


387
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,596
to highlight it instantaneously,


388
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,546
make it feel a little bit


389
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:36,796
faster.


390
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:38,836
This also helps us know that a


391
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,696
button is enabled and that it


392
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:41,306
can work.


393
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,326
Maybe we try connecting the


394
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,556
feedforward on the button to the


395
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,096
feedforward of the toaster


396
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:52,256
itself, as I said we can start


397
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,566
to hint toward what will happen.


398
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,926
So here what I'm trying is as I


399
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,826
touch this button maybe we show


400
00:14:57,826 --> 00:14:59,066
the piece of toast starting to


401
00:14:59,066 --> 00:14:59,326
appear.


402
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,206
I feel like that might be a


403
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:02,606
little bit too much for this


404
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:03,676
button though, so I'm not going


405
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:04,766
to go forward with that but I


406
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,326
tried it.


407
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:08,356
Another thing that we should


408
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,846
think about with feedforward is


409
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:12,016
what happens if I change my


410
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:14,136
mind, let's say I'm kind of


411
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:15,496
groggy in the morning, I pick up


412
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,136
my phone I accidentally touch


413
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,906
this button but I don't want to


414
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:19,826
start my toaster yet.


415
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:22,946
Well for most buttons I can


416
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:25,056
actually drag my finger outside


417
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,946
of the button to begin canceling


418
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:27,626
it.


419
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:29,876
This is something that's


420
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,476
actually very important for all


421
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:33,026
sorts of fluid interactions


422
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:35,226
because it's what makes a fluid


423
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,196
interaction undecided.


424
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,346
If you're paging through


425
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,606
different screens you don't know


426
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,606
which screen it's going to end


427
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:44,166
up on until you lift your finger


428
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,126
and the same thing applies to a


429
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:46,956
very simple button.


430
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:49,116
I can bring my finger back


431
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,386
inside the button and have the


432
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:52,856
same feedforward show me that I


433
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,116
am now activating this button


434
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:54,386
again.


435
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:59,376
Now that we've decided a little


436
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,766
bit about the feedforward that


437
00:16:00,766 --> 00:16:01,946
we're going to have we should


438
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:03,486
try this out on a device as


439
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:03,806
well.


440
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:05,946
So again, I know this seems


441
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:07,566
really simple for a button, but


442
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,866
this is very important for


443
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:14,036
scroll, pinch, paging, a lot of


444
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:14,976
touch interactions.


445
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:20,846
Finally, we should think about


446
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,476
how to apply feedback after I


447
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:24,826
have lifted my finger up off of


448
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:25,336
this button.


449
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,386
For a physical button it's going


450
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,966
to return to its original state.


451
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,266
For our onscreen button we're


452
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,866
going to have lifted our finger


453
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:34,946
off the screen.


454
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,496
This is of course the realm of


455
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,726
classic feedback that most of


456
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:42,466
you are familiar with.


457
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:44,466
But the thing I want to point


458
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:45,806
out here is that we can be


459
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,896
thinking about feedback both for


460
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:50,456
the button itself and the


461
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:52,526
action, the result that is


462
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:54,296
happening, and we can think


463
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:55,856
about how to connect the two so


464
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:57,696
people understand what has


465
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:58,116
happened.


466
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:02,836
Again, within our system we're


467
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:05,185
only focusing here on getting


468
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:07,266
people into making toast.


469
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,396
So what happens when I lift my


470
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:13,665
finger from this button?


471
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:15,215
Does the unhighlight happen


472
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:18,026
immediately or is there a slight


473
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:21,086
delay so that even fast taps can


474
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:21,556
be seen?


475
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:23,715
Is there a timer, does this


476
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:26,175
button support double tap, if so


477
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,435
I may have to wait a little bit


478
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:29,306
before showing the confirmation?


479
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:33,696
If we think back to the two


480
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,156
types of feedback we can just


481
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,376
literally tell people what is


482
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:39,826
happening.


483
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:42,496
I can put some text on screen, I


484
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,296
think it's very clear but it


485
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,266
also requires reading and more


486
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:46,706
text.


487
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:50,536
So maybe we can show people,


488
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,686
maybe the button itself provides


489
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,216
some feedback here it's flashing


490
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,786
or maybe it's something that


491
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,426
represents the action that


492
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:01,436
provides feedback.


493
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:04,946
For example, the icon of the


494
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:06,766
toaster itself could show you


495
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:10,776
that it's starting to toast.


496
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,166
Or what we can do is we can just


497
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,476
do both, I can put text on


498
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,386
screen and I can show the


499
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:16,866
toaster.


500
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:18,506
This is great because I might


501
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:19,896
have missed that animation, but


502
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:21,446
I can still see what state the


503
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:22,676
toaster is in.


504
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:27,966
But similar to interacting with


505
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:30,896
the button with feedforward I


506
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,106
should think about what happens


507
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:33,726
if I change my mind.


508
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,286
I've started toasting but maybe


509
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:38,506
I want to cancel, maybe I want


510
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:39,406
to stop the toaster.


511
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:41,606
We could replace that button


512
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,636
with a stop toasting button, but


513
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,116
I think that's not particularly


514
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:46,396
clear because this button looks


515
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:50,076
an awful lot like the make toast


516
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:51,306
button that was up there before.


517
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,786
So maybe there's a separate stop


518
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:55,136
button.


519
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,546
I feel like that red is a little


520
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:01,826
bit too much, so maybe we try


521
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:05,426
that same button but separate


522
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:06,446
from our make toast button.


523
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,466
This is starting to feel a bit


524
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:11,546
better, so what I should do is


525
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:12,826
try it on device again.


526
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:17,686
We should see how the feedback


527
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:20,206
on the button itself connects to


528
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:22,196
the feedback from the toaster


529
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,886
communicating what has happened.


530
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,836
To recap a little bit of what I


531
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:30,316
went over.


532
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,976
Feedback is how you let people


533
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,766
know what it is that your app is


534
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:37,106
doing.


535
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:40,206
You can literally tell people,


536
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:42,526
you can put text on screen it's


537
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:45,946
fine or you can show people, you


538
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,066
can allow them to experience the


539
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,006
change over time.


540
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:53,416
We can apply feedback to all


541
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,486
three phases of an interaction,


542
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,836
even a simple button.


543
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:01,276
And something I was implicitly


544
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:04,326
doing here is trying out options


545
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:05,956
to understand what's too little


546
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,076
and too much.


547
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:08,916
The only way I can really know


548
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,256
if an animation is appropriate


549
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:10,946
or not is to try it.


550
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,216
So what we've done here is we've


551
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,346
designed a very important part


552
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:23,126
of a much larger system, but I


553
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,856
think it'll be a lot easier to


554
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:27,346
figure out the flow of the rest


555
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:28,566
of this once we get this one


556
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,096
piece right.


557
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:34,106
Now that our button is designed


558
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,686
and pretty great I think we can


559
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:38,366
start to think about sound, so


560
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,576
I'd like to invite Hugo up to


561
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:39,906
the stage.


562
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:46,546
[ Applause ]


563
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:47,876
>> Thank you Julian.


564
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:48,976
Hello everyone.


565
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:56,976
Now we can make this quick and


566
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,646
add a simple click sound to this


567
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:00,046
button.


568
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,576
Sounds pretty good or could it


569
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:05,656
be better?


570
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,866
Could Julian have done a better


571
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,196
job and invited me a little


572
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:10,976
earlier on in the process?


573
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:15,586
I'd like to tell you a few


574
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:16,906
things about how as I a sound


575
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,316
designer could approach a


576
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:19,256
project like this.


577
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,066
I'll talk about where to look


578
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:25,696
for inspiration, about designing


579
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:28,456
the sound, and some key building


580
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:30,186
blocks that we use while doing


581
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:30,466
this.


582
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,576
But before we dive in why do we


583
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:35,466
talk about sound?


584
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:39,536
Now some of you may think our


585
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,716
users mute the sound on their


586
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:44,296
phone quite often, is it


587
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:46,936
important to add sound to my


588
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:47,786
app?


589
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:50,056
Well of course it's up to you


590
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:52,296
but George Lucas has said that


591
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:54,846
50% of the experience of a movie


592
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,656
is determined by what we hear,


593
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,406
by its music and sound design.


594
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:02,736
And sound is all around us, we


595
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:05,046
use it to navigate through the


596
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:05,456
world.


597
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:10,636
And sound can help enrich the


598
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:12,506
experience of your products.


599
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:16,506
And it helps us remember the


600
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:19,026
experiences of your app, as well


601
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:22,976
as your brand, so it can have a


602
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,226
big impact.


603
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:26,676
So where do we look for


604
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:27,876
inspiration when we want to


605
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:29,656
design sound for a button?


606
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,046
Well we can start by taking a


607
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,396
little detour and looking at


608
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,816
some real-world buttons.


609
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:40,416
Some of them are made of cheap


610
00:22:40,686 --> 00:22:42,976
materials and sound like this,


611
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,416
while others are made of high


612
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,116
quality materials and sound like


613
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:47,986
this.


614
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:49,996
Well this was actually a


615
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:52,436
recording of the volume button


616
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:54,606
on an iPhone X, of course we


617
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,306
amplified it quite a bit.


618
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,316
These sounds though are


619
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:02,546
essentially byproducts, they're


620
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:05,156
not necessarily designed they're


621
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:06,746
defined by the materials these


622
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:07,966
buttons are made of.


623
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:10,766
But because we're designed for


624
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:11,726
software we have a lot of


625
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:15,846
freedom, so we can choose to not


626
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:18,016
play any sounds at all and often


627
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,926
that is what we do.


628
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:23,566
But if we do decide it's useful


629
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:27,026
to add sounds to UI elements


630
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,126
then we can take cues from


631
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,666
real-world analogs to add


632
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:34,166
meaning to these UI sounds and


633
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:36,106
to help our users understand


634
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:39,396
them.


635
00:23:39,546 --> 00:23:40,876
Now do you want to add sound to


636
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:41,246
your app?


637
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:44,086
Well it depends, think about


638
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:46,456
category your app falls in, who


639
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,226
will use the app and what will


640
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,586
their expectations be, and what


641
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:52,836
is the context, where will the


642
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:53,716
app be used.


643
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:57,386
For our app we know it will be


644
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,256
used by people who like to eat


645
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:01,676
toast and they're used to making


646
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,996
toast in the kitchen, but from


647
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:05,186
now on they can make it from


648
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:07,686
anywhere in the house.


649
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:10,026
They can still though use the


650
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:11,546
audible cues they're used to


651
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:12,656
getting from their toaster in


652
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,756
the kitchen, so for that reason


653
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:17,286
we think that this app is a


654
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:19,416
perfect candidate for the use of


655
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,066
sound.


656
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:24,296
So let's look at the process of


657
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,206
making toast and listen to


658
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:28,346
sounds we encounter.


659
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:32,396
Let's define if these sounds are


660
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:35,046
useful and if they are if we


661
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:36,386
want to use them in our design.


662
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:39,366
So we'll use Julian's timeline


663
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:41,786
for this and listen to the


664
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,576
sounds that this toaster makes.


665
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:47,396
First, we pull down the lever


666
00:24:48,406 --> 00:24:51,336
and then we press it in place.


667
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:55,516
Now what we hear then is the


668
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,286
toaster heating up with a subtle


669
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:58,736
buzzing sound of the coil.


670
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:02,586
[ Buzzing Sound ]


671
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,906
Until our toast is done and the


672
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:09,786
toaster ejects the toast.


673
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,256
Now let's go through these steps


674
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:12,956
one by one.


675
00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:18,056
First, when we pull down the


676
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:21,736
lever we feel the resistance of


677
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,096
the spring while we push it


678
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,496
down, it's almost like if we


679
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:26,716
compare it to what happens in


680
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,886
our app it's like designing


681
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:32,026
sound haptics and animation and


682
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,316
synchronizing them all.


683
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,826
But in our app, we decided to


684
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,806
replace this with a simple


685
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:38,736
button so we don't need to


686
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:40,216
design a sound for it.


687
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:43,616
And when we request the toast


688
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:44,496
that is when we press our


689
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:47,176
button, the next step, and that


690
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:48,596
is what Julian asked me to


691
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:50,446
design a sound for so let's get


692
00:25:50,446 --> 00:25:51,856
to work on that.


693
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:57,046
We can record sounds, we can use


694
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,436
electronic instruments,


695
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:01,096
synthesizers to generate sounds


696
00:26:01,096 --> 00:26:03,826
and then we can use software to


697
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:05,986
scope these sounds into the


698
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:06,506
right shape.


699
00:26:06,676 --> 00:26:07,796
Now I'm not going into great


700
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,086
detail about this today, but


701
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:11,226
please watch last year's talk


702
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,206
Designing Sound if you want to


703
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:14,436
learn more about this process.


704
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:17,746
In the end, we came up with


705
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:18,896
three different options.


706
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:24,856
This is option A, this is option


707
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:32,026
B, and this is option C.


708
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,856
Okay now option A is quite


709
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:38,026
minimalist, it's so simple, it


710
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:39,366
works pretty well with the


711
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:44,606
simple UI of the app but it


712
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:45,746
feels like there's something


713
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:46,156
missing.


714
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,236
And we found out that while we


715
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,386
were designing these that it's


716
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:51,076
much more satisfying if these


717
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,426
sounds have two clicks, one when


718
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:54,886
you press down and one when you


719
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:55,716
lift off your finger.


720
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:59,796
Now option B has this character,


721
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:04,276
but and now it is a sound that's


722
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:06,806
much more realistic, it doesn't


723
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:08,136
really sound like a toaster but


724
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:09,206
it does have this physical


725
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:10,176
quality to it.


726
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:12,586
For the same reason though it


727
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,126
does sound a little harsh and a


728
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:15,366
little metallic.


729
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:20,006
And then there's option C, it's


730
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:25,166
a bit of an odd one but it does


731
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,196
have character and it's a sound


732
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,376
that I would recognize if I hear


733
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:32,326
it again if I use my app again.


734
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:33,346
Another thing that's good about


735
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:35,036
this sound is that it has this


736
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:37,106
tonal confirmation built in,


737
00:27:37,106 --> 00:27:38,696
it's like throwing a checkmark


738
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:40,006
telling you your action


739
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:40,546
succeeded.


740
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:41,866
I'll play it one more time see


741
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:42,606
if you can hear this.


742
00:27:43,216 --> 00:27:47,306
And for all these reasons I


743
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:50,386
think that option C is the one I


744
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:53,776
would recommend going for, it's


745
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,506
a simple sound, it has a


746
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:59,366
friendly character, and it's


747
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:00,286
something unique it's not


748
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:01,976
something I'd recognize from any


749
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:04,246
other app.


750
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,626
Okay so it looks like we're


751
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:09,176
done, at least we made our


752
00:28:09,176 --> 00:28:12,006
button click but we're not done


753
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:12,816
making toast yet.


754
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:16,036
So let's keep going, maybe there


755
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:17,686
are some other opportunities for


756
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,416
the use of sounds in this app.


757
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:20,886
Now as good sound designers we


758
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:22,166
want to tell the whole story.


759
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:26,556
So after pressing our button the


760
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:27,986
toaster heats up and we hear


761
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:29,896
this subtle buzzing sound.


762
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:34,946
Now we can -- is this helpful at

00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,186
all this sound?


764
00:28:36,476 --> 00:28:38,076
Maybe, it tells us something


765
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:39,986
about the state of the device.


766
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,926
So we can choose to play a sound


767
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:44,766
that resembles this on our app


768
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,126
as well, maybe a continuous


769
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,886
sound, something like this.

[ Notification Sound ]


771
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:53,436
But making toast may take


772
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:55,006
several minutes and having this


773
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:56,636
sound play over and over again


774
00:28:57,276 --> 00:28:58,666
might not be the experience


775
00:28:58,666 --> 00:28:59,466
we're looking for right.


776
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:01,616
So how about something a little


777
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,226
more subtle like a timer sound


778
00:29:03,226 --> 00:29:05,096
that fades in and out every half


779
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:06,476
a minute or so.


780
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:09,596
That could work.


781
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:12,456
But does this really need a


782
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,926
sound at all because what we're


783
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,716
really waiting for is what comes


784
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:16,866
next, that's when our toast is


785
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,476
done and this is what we want to


786
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:20,796
notify our users about, that's


787
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:21,906
the important moment.


788
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:25,436
So we want to play a clean and


789
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:27,886
simple notification sound that


790
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,886
they won't miss, something like


791
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:29,976
this.

[ Notification Sound ]


793
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:34,736
Okay so now let's listen to


794
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:35,726
these sounds together.


795
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:38,946
First, we press our button and


796
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,196
then we decided for the next


797
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:44,926
step when the process is active


798
00:29:44,926 --> 00:29:46,066
we don't really need a sound


799
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:47,986
until we get our notification


800
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,426
and the toast is done.


801
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:51,956
And it's important to listen to


802
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,566
these sounds together to make


803
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:56,066
sure they family well together


804
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:58,486
because this is how our app


805
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:00,136
communicates to its users, this


806
00:30:00,136 --> 00:30:01,966
is the voice of our app.


807
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,316
So now our app is in good shape.


808
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,396
I'd like to tell you about some


809
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,296
key building blocks of sound


810
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,596
that we use when designing any


811
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:16,246
kind of sound.


812
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:19,216
The first one is timbre or tone


813
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:19,606
color.


814
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:22,876
And most of you will instantly


815
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:26,336
recognize this one.


816
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:29,366
It's a piano right, but how do


817
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:30,986
we know it's a piano?


818
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:34,206
How do we know it's not a


819
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:34,856
vibraphone?


820
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:40,706
It's determined by the material


821
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:45,126
an instrument is made of, by its


822
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:47,296
shape, and how it's being played


823
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,916
using a mallet, a hammer, a bow


824
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:50,816
or your hands.


825
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,966
So these instruments can play


826
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:54,996
exactly the same tone but sound


827
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:55,916
very different.


828
00:30:56,476 --> 00:30:58,426
Now for our app we decided to go


829
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,396
for a character, for a timbre


830
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:02,266
that is friendly and it's not


831
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:04,726
too harsh or metallic.


832
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:09,326
The next one is frequency or the


833
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,236
pitch of the sound.


834
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,656
Some instruments play at very


835
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:15,746
high frequencies and others play


836
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:17,016
at very low frequencies.


837
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:22,856
But also nonmusical sounds can


838
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:24,696
be played at very high or low


839
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:25,386
frequencies.


840
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:28,106
And when we do this it gives an


841
00:31:28,106 --> 00:31:31,406
indication of the size of an


842
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:31,766
object.


843
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:35,756
So if we take our toaster and we


844
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:39,326
record the toast eject sound, we


845
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:40,816
play it at a very high frequency


846
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,426
it sounds like a tiny little


847
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:42,776
toaster.


848
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:47,316
But if we take the same sound


849
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,626
and play it at a low frequency


850
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:52,556
it sounds like this big giant


851
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:52,976
toaster.


852
00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:02,886
So next up is duration or the


853
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:04,036
length of a sound.


854
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:08,886
Sounds can be very short or ring


855
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:09,836
out much longer.


856
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:15,646
And if we design UI sound and we


857
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:17,316
know our button is going to be


858
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,546
pressed a lot of times in a row


859
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:22,056
it's important for this sound to


860
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:23,816
be very short and subtle.


861
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:26,526
But if it's only pressed once in


862
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:27,616
a while, which is actually the


863
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:29,356
case for our toast app, it's


864
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:30,706
okay if it's a little longer, if


865
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:32,546
it's a little more elaborate.


866
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:38,066
In fact, this sound only plays


867
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:40,706
once every time we use our app.


868
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:44,986
And then there's loudness or


869
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:46,356
amplitude or volume.


870
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:50,316
Now when we design ringtones or


871
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:53,156
alarm sounds we don't want our


872
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:55,496
users to miss them, we don't


873
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:56,596
want them to miss their phone


874
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:58,016

875
00:32:58,016 --> 00:32:58,496

calling me from the back of the


879

880
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:10,006
clear.


881
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:12,226
But if a UI sound would be loud


882
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,236
like this it would become


883
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:15,036
unpleasant.


884
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:18,276
It only needs add this subtle


885
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:19,596
[inaudible] layer to the


886
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:20,236
interaction.


887
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,486

00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:56,766
about designing sounds and


902
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:58,666
adding sounds to your app it's


903
00:33:58,666 --> 00:33:59,686
really good to keep these in


904

to tell you about sound today,

917
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:35,696
from real-world elements, but


918
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:36,926

927
00:34:56,176 --> 00:34:58,216

And lastly, but most


931
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:10,286
importantly, learn by trying


932
00:35:10,286 --> 00:35:10,836
things out.


933
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,576

out was to try them out first.
