[ Applause ]

00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:29,866
>> Hi everyone.


4
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:31,916
Welcome to the Introduction to


5
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:32,986
Dark Mode session.


6
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,616
My name is Raymond Sepulveda,


7
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:36,866
and I'm a macOS designer on the


8
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,136
Human Interface Design team.


9
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:40,176
For the first half of today's


10
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:41,436
session, I'm going to be going


11
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:42,256
over some of the design


12
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:43,826
principles that went into the


13
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,756
design of Dark Mode, as well as


14
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:46,746
some of the design


15
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,686
considerations that you should


16
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:49,336
take into account when updating


17
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:50,546
your own applications to take


18
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:51,606
advantage of Dark Mode.


19
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,576
Then, for the second half of the


20
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,316
session, my engineering


21
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:57,106
colleagues Rachel Goldeen and


22
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:58,266
Taylor Kelly from the Cocoa


23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,756
Frameworks team are going to be


24
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:01,836
going over how to adopt and


25
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:03,506
support Dark Mode using an


26
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:04,866
example application that they


27
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:05,426
built together.


28
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:07,016
The three of us are super


29
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:08,016
excited to share all of these


30
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:09,246
details with all of you, so


31
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:10,086
let's jump right in.


32
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:13,086
As we announced in yesterday's


33
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,316
keynote, macOS 10.14 is going to


34
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:16,896
be getting a new interface


35
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:19,186
appearance, and we call it Dark


36
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:19,416
Mode.


37
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,146
The new design is very


38
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,466
attractive and engaging, while


39
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,036
at the same time being very calm


40
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:26,806
and understated.


41
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:28,566
These are great qualities for an


42
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:29,626
interface, and they make it


43
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,266
great for creative professionals


44
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:33,076
who are dealing with heavily


45
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:34,906
detailed images and colorful


46
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,516
assets such as images and video


47
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:37,896
assets.


48
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:40,966
But, in actuality, it's actually


49
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:42,536
great for just about any type of


50
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,526
user who is looking to


51
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:46,326
concentrate or focus on any


52
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:47,376
given task at hand.


53
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:48,936
So, whether you're trying to


54
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,396
concentrate on writing the next


55
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:52,856
great novel or you're trying to


56
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,146
read one without disturbing your


57
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:56,136
bedside partner, Dark Mode is


58
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:57,486
really great for either type of


59
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:58,156
situation.


60
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:05,686
The interface shares a lot of


61
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:07,166
family resemblances between the


62
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,496
light appearance and the dark


63
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,846
appearance, and that is because


64
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:11,246
we wanted to encourage users to


65
00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:13,066
switch between both appearances


66
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:16,116
easily and find the one that


67
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:17,386
really best suits their needs.


68
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:18,896
And so it was very important


69
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:19,876
that things like control


70
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:22,216
metrics, window layout, and the


71
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:24,186
distribution of translucent


72
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,826
materials be the same as much as


73
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:26,746
possible between both


74
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,436
appearances.


75
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:30,056
As such it's also equally


76
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,166
important that all of your


77
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,446
applications take full advantage


78
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,316
of both appearances so that they


79
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:37,156
update correctly between both


80
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,996
appearances no matter what the


81
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:40,716
system is running under.


82
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:41,796
You really don't want to be that


83
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:42,956
one light appearance that's


84
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:46,066
stuck in dark appearance.


85
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:47,656
All in all, we're super happy


86
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:49,226
with how the design turned out,


87
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:51,196
and we are really anxious to see


88
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,286
what you guys are going to turn


89
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,576
your apps into as soon as you


90
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:55,796
get hands on the developer beta


91
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:56,896
and start adopting the Dark


92
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,136
Mode.


93
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,386
Aside from Dark Mode, another


94
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:02,866
new interface feature that we


95
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,966
added into macOS 10.14 are


96
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:05,866
accent colors.


97
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,036
Previous releases of macOS


98
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,376
offered two accent colors, blue


99
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:12,196
and graphite, but for macOS


100
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:13,876
10.14, we've expanded the color


101
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:15,266
palette to include eight fun


102
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,556
colors to really help you


103
00:03:16,556 --> 00:03:18,756
personalize your Mac.


104
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:20,926
So, if you're like me and you


105
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,556
love the color red, you're going


106
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:23,696
to immediately switch over to


107
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:25,596
the color red [laughs].


108
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:30,016
If orange or yellow are more of


109
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,456
your preference, you're going to


110
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,286
switch over to those, and we


111
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,316
make those available as well.


112
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:38,256
I should note that the accent


113
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:39,336
colors are not just a


114
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,376
sub-feature of Dark Mode, but


115
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:42,626
they're also available in Light


116
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:42,896
Mode.


117
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,986
So if you prefer Light Mode but


118
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:46,626
want green accent color, you can


119
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,316
do that as well.


120
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:50,316
So, now that we've covered a


121
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:51,856
little bit of the basics of what


122
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:53,896
Dark Mode is and what accent


123
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,616
colors are also, let's dive a


124
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:56,696
little bit deeper into some of


125
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,006
the design principles that went


126
00:03:58,006 --> 00:03:58,806
into Dark Mode.


127
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,686
At Apple, when we begin a new


128
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:02,916
design project, we like to


129
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,326
establish a set of design


130
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:05,456
principles to help guide us


131
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:06,476
throughout the entire design


132
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:06,996
process.


133
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,506
And, with Dark Mode, there were


134
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,426
three in particular that we


135
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,786
referred to quite often


136
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:14,606
throughout the entire process.


137
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:16,505
The first one is the most


138
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,625
straightforward, so let's just


139
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:19,696
jump right into that one, and


140
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:20,976
that is that dark interfaces are


141
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:23,716
cool, period, right?


142
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:25,386
They are almost effortlessly


143
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:26,736
cool in a way that light


144
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:28,116
interfaces sometimes kind of


145
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:28,976
struggle to be.


146
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:31,006
But why is that, really?


147
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,926
Part of it is because we all


148
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:34,206
have these notions of what a


149
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,706
dark interface is and what a


150
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:36,876
dark interface looks like.


151
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,646
And a lot of that is fed into us


152
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:39,876
by what we've seen in pop


153
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:41,286
cultures in things such as


154
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,626
sci-fi movies and action movies.


155
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,456
So much so that if I were to go


156
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:46,476
around the audience and ask


157
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:47,716
everyone to give me one-word


158
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:49,476
association of what a dark


159
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,236
interface is to them, I'd get


160
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:52,516
responses such as cool, of


161
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:55,596
course; slick; professional;


162
00:04:56,056 --> 00:04:58,276
futuristic; and even beautiful.


163
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,786
So going into the design for


164
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,406
Dark Mode, we really wanted to


165
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:04,346
acknowledge all of these


166
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,246
aesthetic associations that we


167
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:08,306
all have with dark interfaces,


168
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,986
while at the same time embracing


169
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:12,536
a lot of the real benefits that


170
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,496
a dark design offers you, such


171
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,256
as a higher contrast for


172
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:18,136
typography.


173
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:20,426
We realize that Dark Mode is


174
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,176
really, really cool, and that a


175
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,216
lot of you are going to want to


176
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:24,656
adopt Dark Mode on your apps


177
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:25,436
permanently.


178
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,666
But, in actuality, only a small


179
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:29,016
subset of apps really should be


180
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,666
dark all the time, and those are


181
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,646
things that are media-centric or


182
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:34,856
content-creation apps.


183
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:35,886
Those are the ones that are best


184
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:37,246
suited to staying dark all the


185
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:38,766
time, so if your app doesn't


186
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:39,516
fall into one of those


187
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:41,366
categories, it's better to let


188
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,686
your app follow what the system


189
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:43,876
appearance is, rather than to


190
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,046
make it dark permanently.


191
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:49,606
The second principle was that


192
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,576
dark interfaces are not just


193
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:52,146
inverted.


194
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,886
And, really, what's at the core


195
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,356
here is that when you look at a


196
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,946
dark interface, it can sometimes


197
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:00,416
be easy to think of just taking


198
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,486
the light interface and


199
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,826
inverting it to end up with your


200
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:03,666
final result.


201
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:05,946
But, in actuality, that can be


202
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,986
very creatively limiting, and so


203
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:09,526
it's better to take a look at


204
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:10,276
your elements and your


205
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:12,186
application on a case-by-case


206
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:16,006
basis and try to determine what


207
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:18,316
is the visual cue that they're


208
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:19,826
trying to communicate and then


209
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,926
figure out whether an opposite


210
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,406
visual cue is necessary.


211
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:25,136
So, if you take something, for


212
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,376
example, like, a standard Light


213
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:28,706
push button in the light


214
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:30,376
appearance, the buttons look


215
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:31,756
like this in their active state.


216
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:33,656
And, then, when you click on


217
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:35,026
them, the buttons darken.


218
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,046
And this is generally true of


219
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:38,546
almost all of the controls in


220
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:39,636
the light appearance in that


221
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,336
their click state is a darker


222
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:42,486
version of what their active


223
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,056
state was.


224
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,716
In Dark Mode, however, the


225
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,096
general active state looks like


226
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,996
this, and when you click on


227
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:50,486
them, they brighten, and that,


228
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,096
again, is generally true of all


229
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:52,866
of the controls.


230
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,546
They will all generally brighten


231
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:56,746
up.


232
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:59,446
Another example are group boxes.


233
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,126
In light appearance, the group


234
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,966
boxes have a dark fill behind


235
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:05,756
them and are shaded such along


236
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:07,586
the edges to give them a


237
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,216
recessed quality such that they


238
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,346
look like they're carved into


239
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,286
the window background that


240
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:12,436
they're inside of.


241
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:16,166
In Dark Mode, however, the group


242
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,586
boxes are treated almost as if


243
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,176
they are self-illuminated.


244
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,156
But, at the end of the day, the


245
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:23,856
general purpose of the group box


246
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:24,916
is the same between the two


247
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,016
modes in that what they're


248
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,066
really trying to communicate to


249
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,526
the user is that the contents


250
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,406
contained therein are all


251
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:32,316
related somehow.


252
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:35,956
Why I said that it was important


253
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:38,166
to go on a case-by-case basis


254
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,976
and try and determine what the


255
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:43,176
visual cue that your elements


256
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:45,266
are trying to communicate-- It's


257
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,916
important, is because, in some


258
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,306
cases, the visual cue that's


259
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:50,206
being communicated is already


260
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:51,506
effective enough in the Light


261
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:53,376
Mode and should be left as is in


262
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:53,916
Dark Mode.


263
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:56,086
An example of this are the


264
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:56,906
window shadows.


265
00:07:57,786 --> 00:08:00,596
As we all know, macOS is a


266
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,786
layered window environment, and


267
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:03,946
the window shadows really help


268
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:04,946
to communicate the sense of


269
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,236
depth, the Z-depth of the


270
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:06,766
windows.


271
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,686
So, if we were to have inverted


272
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:10,056
the window shadows, for example,


273
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,406
and started using a white


274
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,246
shadow, for example, the entire


275
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:14,606
UI would have become flat.


276
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:15,796
You would have lost that sense


277
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:19,186
of depth.


278
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:20,256
Another thing to note is that


279
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:21,836
the window shadows in macOS are


280
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,206
constructed of two layers.


281
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:24,666
We've got the diffused shadow


282
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:25,546
and the rim shadow.


283
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,536
So, if we look at this little


284
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:30,626
portion of the screen and look


285
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,256
at how the shadows were


286
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:33,126
constructed and treated in Dark


287
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:35,166
Mode, the first thing to note is


288
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,775
that, in taking into


289
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,895
consideration that users are


290
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:40,775
going to be able to go back and


291
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,086
forth between light and dark


292
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,536
appearance quite often and that


293
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:45,916
some apps are going to stay dark


294
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:47,766
all the time, it was important


295
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:48,996
for us to keep the diffused


296
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,896
shadow exactly the same.


297
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,706
So, we used the exact same


298
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,406
shadow blur parameters for the


299
00:08:55,406 --> 00:08:56,796
shadows in Dark Mode.


300
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,536
Next, we took a look at the rim


301
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:02,426
shadows and saw what changes we


302
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:04,066
needed to do for those, and the


303
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,176
changes that we did for Dark


304
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:06,696
Mode where we adjusted the


305
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:07,826
opacity to make them a little


306
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,816
bit higher so that the contrast


307
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:12,086
edge was more defined and that


308
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,236
we made them a little bit


309
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:13,676
crisper.


310
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:18,866
To further the focus and the


311
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:20,886
edge detail on the windows, we


312
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:24,026
added an inner rim stroke to the


313
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:26,476
windows to really help define


314
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:28,646
the windows and pop them off.


315
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,306
The end result is that the


316
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:32,606
visual cue still looks very


317
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,406
similar to the light appearance,


318
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,366
but the end result has been


319
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,196
finely tuned for dark appearance


320
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:40,906
so that it works much better.


321
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,926
The second principle was that


322
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,276
Dark Mode is content focused,


323
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:50,166
and this was the one that we


324
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,676
referred back to the most often


325
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:52,826
throughout the entire process,


326
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:53,246
actually.


327
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:56,896
When you look at a light


328
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,066
interface screen, it can


329
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,226
sometimes be a little difficult


330
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,396
to tell what the content is,


331
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,366
where to focus your attention


332
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:04,606
to, especially when there are


333
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:06,286
lots of windows on the screen.


334
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:08,386
And part of the reason for that


335
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:09,956
is because a lot of the content


336
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:11,186
that we all create is just


337
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:12,456
bright in general.


338
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,336
However, in a dark UI, the


339
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:18,326
content stands out because of


340
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,206
the background being pretty


341
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:21,246
dark.


342
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,676
All of the window chrome in the


343
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:24,756
background generally just melts


344
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:26,466
away, and the content becomes


345
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:27,646
the primary focus of your


346
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:28,136
attention.


347
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,246
Generally, we found that there


348
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,096
were three methods for how to


349
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,996
treat your content regions


350
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:35,656
inside of your windows to


351
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,406
optimize the content focus.


352
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,926
The first method was to just


353
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,466
generally go completely dark.


354
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:43,946
An app like Finder is a great


355
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,076
example of where this is


356
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:47,246
possible because of the way that


357
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,396
the content is displayed.


358
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:50,646
Finder's content are displayed


359
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,316
as colorful file icons and so


360
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:54,516
the dark background really helps


361
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:56,606
the icons stand out as much as


362
00:10:58,106 --> 00:10:58,536
possible.


363
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:00,626
The second method was to leave


364
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:02,716
the content as is.


365
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:04,826
Pages is a great example of what


366
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,726
you see is what you get app,


367
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,036
where the contents should be


368
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,646
rendered and presented exactly


369
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:12,776
as the user authored and created


370
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:12,946
it.


371
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,276
Dark Mode is a great UI for what


372
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:17,856
you see is what you get apps,


373
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,566
because the content really


374
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:21,906
becomes the primary focus, and


375
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,576
the UI really becomes the


376
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:25,136
secondary focus and almost melts


377
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:25,536
away.


378
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:32,846
The third method was to make the


379
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,696
content region appearance a user


380
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:35,246
option.


381
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,456
Mail is a good example of an app


382
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:38,616
where the appearance of the


383
00:11:38,686 --> 00:11:40,786
content might be ambiguous as to


384
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:41,946
whether the user would prefer it


385
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:44,386
to be light or dark, and so the


386
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:46,486
best thing to do is to make an


387
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:47,796
application setting so that the


388
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:49,066
user can determine whether they


389
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,276
want it to be light or dark on


390
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,406
their own, while their


391
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,806
application's chrome area still


392
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:55,416
respects the overall system


393
00:11:58,346 --> 00:11:58,806
appearance.


394
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:00,216
One thing that all three of


395
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,866
these windows had in common was


396
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,796
that the chrome remained dark


397
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:06,096
and became secondary to the


398
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:06,826
content area.


399
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,026
And Dark Mode kind of achieves


400
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,666
this using a feature that we


401
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,946
call desktop tinting, which


402
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,586
causes the window's background


403
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,576
colors to camouflage themselves


404
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:17,966
with the desktop picture.


405
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,286
We found that completely


406
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,386
desaturated gray colors have a


407
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:23,606
tendency to have a color


408
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,226
temperature that was sometimes


409
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,336
in conflict with what your


410
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,596
desktop picture was, and this


411
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,496
effect was magnified when you


412
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,646
have a translucent sidebar area,


413
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:35,696
for example, against a solid


414
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:38,526
opaque area of your window, and


415
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,626
so desktop tinting helps


416
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:40,416
mitigate that.


417
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:41,986
Once applied, the desktop


418
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:43,656
tinting gives the whole window a


419
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:45,346
harmonious color scheme, which


420
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:48,716
helps it to blend in with the


421
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:50,916
surrounding areas and really


422
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,236
reduces that color temperature


423
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:52,906
disparity.


424
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,616
So, how do we do the desktop


425
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:57,776
tinting effect?


426
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:58,916
The first thing that we do is,


427
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,946
actually, we take a sample of


428
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,936
the desktop portion that is


429
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:04,626
behind the window, and then we


430
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:07,416
derive a average color for that


431
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,656
area, and then we blend that


432
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,426
average color with a gray, which


433
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:13,566
then becomes the window


434
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,346
background color.


435
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:16,406
This background color is


436
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:18,366
dynamic, so as the user moves


437
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,596
the window around the screen,


438
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:21,186
the color will update itself so


439
00:13:21,186 --> 00:13:22,456
that the window always stays in


440
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:24,326
sync with the wallpaper portion


441
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:25,176
that was behind it.


442
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:28,566
So, if we look at the effect in


443
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,746
action across a couple of


444
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:31,656
different wallpapers, you can


445
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,916
see that the window is adjusting


446
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,676
itself on the right side to


447
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:37,196
match the desktop picture that


448
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:37,816
is behind it.


449
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,196
Not only does the window


450
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,106
background color adjust itself


451
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:45,526
to take advantage of the desktop


452
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,566
color, but the controls also get


453
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:48,666
a little bit of that going


454
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,986
through them also due to the


455
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:51,146
control's opacity.


456
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:56,696
For users that work in


457
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,756
color-sensitive applications or


458
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,456
have very color-sensitive


459
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,456
content or just generally would


460
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:03,776
prefer not to have the desktop


461
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,996
tinting apply to their UI, we


462
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,986
offer the Graphite Mode so that


463
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:11,466
they can disable the color


464
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:15,106
tinting altogether.


465
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:16,946
If we take a look at the color


466
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,106
swatches for the window


467
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,306
background colors, along the top


468
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,546
there, we can see the window


469
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,406
background color in the Light


470
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:25,586
Mode, which is the standard


471
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:26,546
light gray that we're all


472
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:27,416
accustomed to.


473
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:28,746
And, in the middle there, we've


474
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,126
got the under page background


475
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:31,876
color, which is a mid-tone gray,


476
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:34,196
and then we've got the content


477
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:35,836
background, which is the white


478
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:36,936
background color that we're all


479
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:38,976
familiar with behind all of our


480
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:39,806
content areas.


481
00:14:40,716 --> 00:14:42,016
In the middle row, you can see


482
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,876
how the desktop tinting affects


483
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:45,636
these colors, and, then, along


484
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,896
the bottom, you can see the


485
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:48,476
effects of the graphite accent


486
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:50,456
color disabling the desktop


487
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,146
tinting effect.


488
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:55,636
So, now that we've gone over


489
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:56,866
some of the design principles,


490
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,276
let's go into a little bit of


491
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,426
the design considerations that


492
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:00,506
you should take into account


493
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:03,316
when updating your apps.


494
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,416
First, let's talk about colors.


495
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:08,746
For macOS 10.14, we added a lot


496
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:09,286
of colors.


497
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,056
We also removed a lot of colors,


498
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,446
updated some, and, as you can


499
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:16,706
see behind me, these are some of


500
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:17,616
our system colors.


501
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:19,696
Along the bottom, we've got the


502
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,026
dark variance of the colors,


503
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,506
and, as you can see, the dark


504
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,916
versions are generally a little


505
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,626
bit brighter and more saturated.


506
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,356
Rachel and Taylor are going to a


507
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:30,636
little bit deeper into the color


508
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,266
usage during their portion of


509
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,136
today's session, but, for now, I


510
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,656
just generally want to try and


511
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,566
cover three colors in


512
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,356
particular, which are the blues.


513
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:41,086
Going from left to right, we've


514
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:42,336
got controlAccentColor,


515
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,456
systemBlueColor, and linkColor.


516
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:47,076
Linkcolor, as the name implies,


517
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:49,936
is meant to be applied to links,


518
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,156
text links in particular.


519
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,536
So, things that are hyperlinks,


520
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,576
taking of the user to a website,


521
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,456
or a link within your


522
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,846
application that navigates the


523
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,336
user to another area of your


524
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,566
application-- those should be


525
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,526
treated with linkColor.


526
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:04,816
ControlAccentColor and


527
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,696
systemBlueColor are really meant


528
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:09,136
to be used on controls that have


529
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:10,896
visible borders or button bezel


530
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:13,496
backgrounds or for tinted


531
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:13,856
glyphs.


532
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:16,516
ControlAccentColor, as the name


533
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:19,416
implies, is going to respond to


534
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:21,296
whatever the system accent color


535
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:22,866
is set to, in this case, red.


536
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,026
So, if you have a custom control


537
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,186
that is trying to mimic the


538
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,086
appearance of a standard system


539
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,886
control, or you just have a


540
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:31,196
control that you would like to


541
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:32,476
follow suit with whatever the


542
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:34,486
system appearance is set to, you


543
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:35,896
should use controlAccentColor.


544
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,036
If you have a control where it's


545
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:39,386
important that the control stays


546
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:41,646
blue because of informational


547
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:43,076
purposes or for branding


548
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,506
purposes, then systemBlueColor


549
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,516
is a better choice for you to


550
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:46,846
use.


551
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:50,286
Next, let's take a look at


552
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:51,336
designing with vibrancy.


553
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:54,926
When we talk about vibrancy,


554
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,036
what we're generally referring


555
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:58,066
to is the package of a


556
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:00,356
translucent material working in


557
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:01,526
conjunction with the content


558
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:02,676
that is displayed above it.


559
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:05,626
So, in this case, the vibrancy


560
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:07,955
is the vibrant Finder sidebar.


561
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:12,296
Generally, we have non-colored


562
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,965
artwork that is meant to be


563
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,076
treated vibrantly.


564
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,195
An example of that is the glyphs


565
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,606
and the text in the Finder


566
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,175
sidebar here.


567
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:25,756
The end result of the vibrancy


568
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:28,056
is is that the colors become


569
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:30,196
higher saturation, and the


570
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:31,946
contrast is increased for things


571
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:32,456
like the text.


572
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:35,616
Colored artwork, such as the


573
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:37,416
finder tags in this example,


574
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:38,506
should be treated as


575
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,196
non-vibrant.


576
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:41,636
Same thing with colored


577
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:42,406
iconography.


578
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:45,246
The vibrancy will destroy the


579
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,836
original colors that you have in


580
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,456
your image, and so you want to


581
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:49,646
treat those as non-vibrant.


582
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,756
So, taking a look at how you can


583
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:55,806
construct vibrant content, it


584
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:57,946
might seem almost obvious to


585
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:00,466
just use opacities, in this


586
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,726
case, opacities of white.


587
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,276
But while it's true that some


588
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:06,636
color contribution from the


589
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,156
background is occurring through


590
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:12,206
the materials here-- and that's


591
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:12,946
happening because of the


592
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:14,456
opacity-- the end result is


593
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:16,346
actually not as highly saturated


594
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,336
as we would desire.


595
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,546
And, as you can see along the


596
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:22,946
bottom with the Quaternary Label


597
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,396
Color, the legibility is a


598
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,446
little bit compromised.


599
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,216
Instead, what you want to do is


600
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,576
construct these using opaque


601
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:31,636
grayscale colors.


602
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,786
One thing to note here is that


603
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:37,266
the text color for the RGB label


604
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,756
colors here are full black.


605
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,726
What's going to happen once the


606
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:44,146
Blend Mode is applied is that


607
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:46,406
the text that is black is going


608
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:47,806
to become completely


609
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:48,466
transparent.


610
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,046
So, if you have areas of your


611
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,316
content that need to be treated


612
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,236
as a knockout, use full opaque


613
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:54,956
black, and if you have areas


614
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,626
that need to be gradiate towards


615
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:59,226
an opacity, use a gray that is


616
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,706
ramping itself towards a full


617
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:00,916
black.


618
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:03,186
This is true in Dark Mode, and


619
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:04,506
the opposite is true in Light


620
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:05,986
Mode, in light, vibrant areas, I


621
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:08,486
should say, where white full,


622
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:11,096
opaque white is full transparent


623
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:12,646
and gradiating towards that is


624
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:13,466
going to give you a


625
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:14,596
transparency.


626
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:18,156
So, once we apply the vibrancy,


627
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,476
we can see that the gray colors


628
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,116
become a lot more saturated, and


629
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:26,016
the legibility of the Quaternary


630
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,306
Color Label is a lot more


631
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:27,776
improved.


632
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:29,796
Putting them side by side, we


633
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:32,326
can see just how much of a


634
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:34,026
difference there is between the


635
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:35,776
opacity construction, versus the


636
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:36,856
grayscale construction.


637
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,486
In some cases, over certain


638
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:43,036
colors, the opacity construction


639
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:45,466
will fly, but it's not exactly


640
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,636
the best end result,


641
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,046
aesthetically or legibility


642
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:50,476
wise.


643
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:54,976
Next, let's take a look at


644
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,396
artistically inverting glyphs,


645
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:58,456
and, by artistically inverting,


646
00:19:58,456 --> 00:19:59,856
what I'm referring to is the


647
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,856
process of creatively looking at


648
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,516
your glyphs and determining what


649
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:05,316
areas need to be adjusted to


650
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:06,916
take advantage of the Dark Mode,


651
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:08,856
for example.


652
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,876
So, here we've got a set of our


653
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:13,566
standard glyphs that we have in


654
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:14,216
the light appearance.


655
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:16,106
One thing to note is that the


656
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:17,726
light appearances glyphs


657
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,716
generally use a lot of edge


658
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,996
strokes with hollow centers.


659
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:24,406
And the reason for that is that


660
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:25,746
we take advantage of the white


661
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:27,186
backgrounds that these are


662
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,156
generally placed on top of in


663
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:32,086
order to denote form and shape.


664
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:34,826
But, if we were to take these


665
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:36,736
exact same vector forms and


666
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:38,246
place them over a dark


667
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,196
background, all of that sense of


668
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:42,606
form and volume is kind of lost,


669
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:44,666
and so we had to artistically


670
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,526
invert them to bring back some


671
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:47,766
of that sense of form and


672
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:48,306
volume.


673
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:51,976
Looking at how some of these are


674
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,916
constructed, we've got a couple


675
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,206
of simple examples, like this


676
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:55,606
finder tag.


677
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:58,886
On the left side, it's denoting


678
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:00,826
a white tag with a dark eyelet


679
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:01,346
cutout.


680
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:03,286
On the right side, however, in


681
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:05,406
Dark Mode, that sense of it


682
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,976
being a white sheet of paper is


683
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:07,336
lost.


684
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,636
So, once we invert it, we get


685
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:10,936
back that white sheet of paper


686
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,126
with an eyelet knockout hole.


687
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:15,386
Looking at how this is


688
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:18,976
constructed, generally, what you


689
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:23,056
would do is expand the clipping


690
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,686
paths, I should say, and then


691
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:27,416
select your eyelet shape and


692
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,756
then reverse the knockout on


693
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:29,606
that.


694
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:31,006
And then it's just a game of


695
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:35,386
selecting any redundant vector


696
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:38,896
paths and removing those.


697
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,896
Taking a look at a slightly more


698
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:42,856
complex shape, for example, the


699
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:43,226
house.


700
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,246
We've got a white house on the


701
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,396
left side, and on the right


702
00:21:47,426 --> 00:21:48,566
side, the house isn't white


703
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:48,996
anymore.


704
00:21:49,616 --> 00:21:52,056
So, inverting it returns us back


705
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:54,936
to a white painted house.


706
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,196
Generally, the construction for


707
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,626
this is about the same as the


708
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:02,376
other process, but one important


709
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,066
aspect of this glyph, in


710
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:06,316
particular, was that we have to


711
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:09,116
add a new shape into the vector


712
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:09,536
form.


713
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:11,036
In this case, we're mimicking


714
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:13,646
the roof line, creating a shadow


715
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,326
underneath the roof that we're


716
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:17,286
going to knock out.


717
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,646
And this is important, because


718
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,826
if we were to have left the


719
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:21,816
construction of the house


720
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:23,706
without that shadow line, the


721
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,186
roof would have no definition,


722
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:26,136
and it would be really hard to


723
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,586
see that at small size.


724
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:32,156
Moving on to a more complicated


725
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:35,056
glyph, like this mail envelope,


726
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:35,666
for example.


727
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:37,646
On the left side, we can see a


728
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:38,986
sense of volume and shape.


729
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:41,086
We've got two layers, generally.


730
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,656
We've got the back flap of the


731
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:43,626
envelope, and we've got the


732
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,696
front flap of the envelope with


733
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:47,026
a letter contained in between.


734
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:48,876
On the right side, a lot of that


735
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:50,456
sense of volume is just missing


736
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,466
because of the lack of fill


737
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:53,096
colors.


738
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:56,306
And so, once we invert that, we


739
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:57,576
return back to having a sense of


740
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:57,956
volume.


741
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,736
Again, generally, the process of


742
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:03,436
construction for this one is


743
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:04,406
about the same as some of the


744
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:06,706
other ones, but it's a little


745
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:10,246
bit more detailed and time


746
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,066
consuming just due to the number


747
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,106
of paths that there are.


748
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:14,866
But, generally, what you want to


749
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,116
do is break it apart into two


750
00:23:16,116 --> 00:23:17,816
pieces, again, so that you have


751
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:19,256
the front and the rear portion,


752
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,936
and then you have your letter


753
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:21,956
portion in between.


754
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:24,636
One important detail that this


755
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:29,026
glyph exemplifies is the dual


756
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:30,756
opacities that we use in some of


757
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:31,146
our glyphs.


758
00:23:31,336 --> 00:23:32,696
In this case, the letter is set


759
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,536
to 80% opacity in order to make


760
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:36,956
it secondary to the envelope,


761
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:38,316
itself, being opened, which is


762
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:38,876
what we're trying to


763
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:39,486
communicate.


764
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:42,026
And the opposite is true in


765
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:43,756
Light Mode also, where we do use


766
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:45,906
80% opacities, in some cases,


767
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:46,406
also.


768
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,796
So, quickly wrapping up what


769
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,846
we've covered so far.


770
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:55,646
Dark interfaces are cool, so


771
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:56,876
cool that you're probably going


772
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:57,986
to want to make your app


773
00:23:58,386 --> 00:23:59,886
potentially dark all the time,


774
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,016
but unless your app is a


775
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:03,436
creative or media-centric app,


776
00:24:03,436 --> 00:24:05,016
you should reconsider that, and,


777
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:06,656
instead make your app follow


778
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,666
what the system appearance is


779
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,586
set to, instead.


780
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:12,476
Don't limit your app design to


781
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:14,396
just inverting your existing


782
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:15,846
light appearance, and, instead,


783
00:24:16,016 --> 00:24:18,086
take a look at what elements are


784
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:20,556
in your app on a case-by-case


785
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,266
basis, and try and determine


786
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:23,896
what are the visual cues that


787
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,076
are trying to be communicated by


788
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:27,806
the controls, and then determine


789
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:29,116
whether an opposite visual cue


790
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:33,206
is necessary or not.


791
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:34,846
Then take a look at what type of


792
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:36,806
content your app produces or


793
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,836
displays, and then use that as a


794
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:42,116
guidance to determine what type


795
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,136
of method to use for how to


796
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,336
treat your content area--


797
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:46,886
whether to go fully dark,


798
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:49,826
whether to make it stay as is,


799
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:51,076
or whether to make it a user


800
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:52,716
option via the app settings.


801
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:57,106
Then, taking a look at colors,


802
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:02,026
generally, you want to make sure


803
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:03,526
that you're using the three


804
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:04,666
colors that we went over,


805
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,786
appropriately, if you have


806
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,956
controls that are text controls,


807
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:11,026
try using text link if it's


808
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:11,806
applicable.


809
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:13,746
If you have controls that you


810
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:16,176
want to follow the system accent


811
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:18,746
color appearance, set those to


812
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,736
control accent color, and if you


813
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:21,866
have a control that has to stay


814
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:24,626
blue all the time, adopt system


815
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:25,756
blue color.


816
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,976
And then Taylor and Rachel are


817
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,576
going to go into a lot more


818
00:25:29,576 --> 00:25:30,986
detail about color uses, so


819
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,916
definitely pay attention to


820
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:33,986
their section.


821
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,686
When constructing your vibrancy


822
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:39,226
areas, make sure that you're


823
00:25:39,226 --> 00:25:40,856
constructing them in a way that


824
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:42,186
takes full advantage of the


825
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,046
vibrant effect blending, so make


826
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:45,206
sure that you're using grayscale


827
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:46,236
colors that are opaque.


828
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:47,966
And if you have areas that need


829
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:50,066
to be knockouts or have


830
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:52,646
opacities, ramp towards black in


831
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:54,246
Dark Mode or ramp towards white


832
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,026
in Light Mode.


833
00:25:56,476 --> 00:26:00,056
And then, lastly, make sure that


834
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:01,666
the glyphs that you're using are


835
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:03,666
artistically inverted in order


836
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:07,386
to showcase the intent that the


837
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:08,746
glyphs are trying to communicate


838
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:10,126
to the user as effectively as


839
00:26:10,196 --> 00:26:10,666
possible.


840
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:14,486
Finally, make sure to go to the


841
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,366
Human Interface Guidelines to


842
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,146
see more design guidance.


843
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:21,266
And then as well as checking the


844
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:23,156
design resources section, where,


845
00:26:23,406 --> 00:26:24,796
by the end of the month, we're


846
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,416
going to be making available


847
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,086
updated Photoshop, and sketch


848
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:29,376
templates, and kits for you to


849
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:29,656
use.


850
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,086
And with that, I'd like to hand


851
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:34,756
it off to Rachel to go over some


852
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:36,326
details on how to adopt and


853
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:37,086
support Dark Mode.


854
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:38,076
Thanks

[ Applause ]


856
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:46,976
>> Thank you, Raymond.


857
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:47,856
Hello everybody.


858
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:49,636
Let's take a moment just to


859
00:26:49,636 --> 00:26:51,026
thank Raymond and the rest of


860
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,536
the design team for designing


861
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:52,976
Dark Mode.


862
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:53,976
Isn't it awesome?


863
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:58,516
[ Applause ]


864
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:01,376
Now Taylor and I will take you


865
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:03,026
through the engineering basics


866
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:05,586
of adopting Dark Mode in macOS


867
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:06,116
Mojave.


868
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:12,046
A while back, Taylor and I were


869
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:13,516
chatting, and we discovered that


870
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:15,896
we were both huge fans of


871
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:16,626
chameleons.


872
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,926
And while we don't yet own our


873
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,406
own pet chameleons, we thought


874
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,266
we'd be prepared by writing an


875
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,276
app called Chameleon Wrangler.


876
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:26,666
We did this back in High Sierra,


877
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,726
and so we thought, "Hey, let's


878
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:29,996
update it for Mojave."


879
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,506
The first thing we did was put


880
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:35,266
our system in Dark Mode and


881
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:37,946
launch our app from the dock.


882
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,116
And it didn't really look too


883
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:40,466
dark.


884
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,056
In fact, it's exactly the same


885
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:45,556
between light and dark.


886
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,386
And you'll note throughout this


887
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:49,926
portion of the talk that on the


888
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:51,316
left, when we want to compare,


889
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:52,616
we'll have the light on the left


890
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:53,616
and the dark on the right, so


891
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:54,986
you can compare them side by


892
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:55,376
side.


893
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:57,206
Can't actually run the system


894
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:57,726
this way.


895
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:58,536
It's just for show.


896
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:02,466
So, what we needed to do was


897
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:04,686
link against the 10.14 SDK and


898
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,496
Xcode 10.


899
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:09,166
We built and ran our app, and


900
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:09,416
voila.


901
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,486
It's a lot darker.


902
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:13,596
Comparing with light, you can


903
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:14,616
see a lot of things are


904
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:16,256
different and darker,


905
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,756
automatically, but there's still


906
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:20,176
some things we'd like to fix up.


907
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:23,576
So, we'll go into detail about


908
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,386
some of the colors.


909
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,976
There's a lot of colors.


910
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:32,296
Let's take a look at this header


911
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,096
area that's light green.


912
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:39,416
We implemented this using a


913
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:41,056
hardcoded color, where we


914
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,716
specified our custom RGBA


915
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:43,606
values.


916
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,376
The problem with this approach


917
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,056
is that it doesn't change


918
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:49,036
between the different


919
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:49,676
appearances.


920
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:51,646
You're stuck with the same color


921
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:52,996
no matter what the system


922
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:53,946
preference setting is.


923
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:57,346
Instead of doing it this way,


924
00:28:57,746 --> 00:28:59,426
we're going to take advantage of


925
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:01,256
colors in asset catalogs.


926
00:29:02,236 --> 00:29:03,266
You've been able to do this


927
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:05,476
since 10.13-- have colors in


928
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:08,196
asset catalogs, but now you can


929
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,726
specify colors for different


930
00:29:09,726 --> 00:29:10,356
appearances.


931
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:12,746
So, we've added a dark version


932
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:13,976
of our header color.


933
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:16,456
Asset catalog colors have


934
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:17,716
several advantages.


935
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,976
You can give them meaningful


936
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:23,136
names that describe where the


937
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,886
color is used or how it is used,


938
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:25,876
and those are often called


939
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,176
semantic names.


940
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:31,106
You can have multiple


941
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,676
definitions of the color, as I


942
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:33,906
showed you, with the light and


943
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,906
dark versions and also for


944
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:38,476
different color spaces-- sRGB


945
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:38,846
versus P3.


946
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:42,076
And it gives you a central


947
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,256
location for defining all of


948
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:44,886
your colors.


949
00:29:45,206 --> 00:29:46,686
That makes it easy to go in and


950
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:47,806
tweak your colors without


951
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:49,926
changing any code if needed.


952
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:54,116
So, here's our color now in a


953
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:56,296
asset catalog, and it's called


954
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,656
headerColor, because it's the


955
00:29:57,656 --> 00:29:58,286
header color.


956
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:00,916
And let's see how it looks now,


957
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:02,576
using headerColor.


958
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,606
Looks a lot better and dark with


959
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,446
that dark green.


960
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,846
But something becomes obvious,


961
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:10,116
and that's the text.


962
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:13,236
Chloe's name and age are hard to


963
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:14,526
read now against the darker


964
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:14,966
green.


965
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:19,596
Things looked okay in light, but


966
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:22,276
they don't look good in dark.


967
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:24,516
Well, there, we were using black


968
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,236
and dark gray, and those are


969
00:30:27,236 --> 00:30:28,956
static colors, also.


970
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:31,686
Not exactly the same as


971
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,266
hardcoded, because we're using


972
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,446
available colors, but they don't


973
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:36,896
change.


974
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:39,766
So, instead of using asset


975
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,206
catalogs this time, we're going


976
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,906
to take advantage of dynamic


977
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:44,626
system colors.


978
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:48,416
NSColor has many dynamic colors


979
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:50,366
available for you to use with


980
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:51,766
definitions across the different


981
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,386
appearances.


982
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,106
And a special thing about


983
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:57,156
NSColor is that the colors are


984
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,476
resolved at draw time, which


985
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:01,506
means that the actual RGBA


986
00:31:01,746 --> 00:31:04,596
values that are used depend on


987
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,286
the circumstances at the time


988
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:07,366
that the color is drawn.


989
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,976
I'm going to go through some


990
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,996
examples of dynamic system


991
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:12,636
colors now.


992
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,766
Starting with the label colors


993
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:16,856
that Raymond talked about


994
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:19,806
earlier, and I'm showing the


995
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:21,586
dynamic colors on the top half


996
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,576
and some corresponding static


997
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,076
colors just using black in


998
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,606
varying levels of opacity on the


999
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:27,306
bottom half.


1000
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:29,716
And, as you can see, in the


1001
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:31,026
light appearance, everything


1002
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:31,736
looks fine.


1003
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:34,626
But over in dark, labelColor


1004
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,466
looks great still, but the black


1005
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:37,676
colors disappear against the


1006
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:38,456
dark background.


1007
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:42,856
Here's an example in the system


1008
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:45,326
in Mail of where labelColor and


1009
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,586
secondaryLabelColor are used.


1010
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:50,396
The more important text is given


1011
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:51,856
the labelColor, and the less


1012
00:31:51,856 --> 00:31:53,436
important text is


1013
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:54,496
secondaryLabelColor.


1014
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:59,006
To find out which colors are


1015
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:01,296
dynamic, in the Interface


1016
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:03,886
Builder popup menu for colors,


1017
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:05,626
it'll show you the list, and


1018
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,056
they've done a really nice job


1019
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,726
of making those be the dynamic


1020
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:10,146
colors.


1021
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:14,876
So, now switching, once we know


1022
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:17,016
that, black color and dark gray


1023
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,686
to labelColor and


1024
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:21,756
secondaryLabelColor, this fixes


1025
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,866
our text, and it looks great in


1026
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:25,586
both light and dark.


1027
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:29,256
A little bit more about dynamic


1028
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:30,056
system colors.


1029
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,336
As Raymond showed you, there are


1030
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:35,146
a bunch of colorful system


1031
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:36,476
colors-- systemRed,


1032
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:38,176
systemYellow, systemGreen are


1033
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:39,296
just three examples.


1034
00:32:40,086 --> 00:32:41,816
And they subtly change for the


1035
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:43,086
different appearances so that


1036
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,626
they look great in both places,


1037
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:46,896
as opposed to the static, plain


1038
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:48,276
red, yellow, green colors.


1039
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,166
Another special thing about


1040
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,736
using systemRed, etc., is that


1041
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:56,286
they will match other uses of


1042
00:32:56,396 --> 00:32:58,706
systemRed throughout the OS as


1043
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:00,106
well as matching on iOS.


1044
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:03,246
So, it's great to stick to these


1045
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,826
kinds of colors when you have an


1046
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:07,176
informational content in your


1047
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:07,536
color.


1048
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:09,256
It needs to be red or yellow for


1049
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:10,326
a warning, for example.


1050
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:15,016
Raymond also talked about


1051
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:17,316
linkColor, systemBlue, and


1052
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:18,946
controlAccentColor, so I wanted


1053
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:20,146
to talk about that again.


1054
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:22,776
LinkColor and systemBlue are


1055
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,126
very similar but slightly


1056
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:26,296
different and use linkColor for


1057
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,466
actual links to webpages or for


1058
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,636
going someplace in your app,


1059
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,786
whereas systemBlue is used for


1060
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:34,926
standard actions in your


1061
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:36,576
application, or you might even


1062
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:38,086
use controlAccentColor if you


1063
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:39,096
want to match the system


1064
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:40,576
preference, in this case,


1065
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:40,916
purple.


1066
00:33:42,676 --> 00:33:45,106
You may search through your


1067
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,486
application code and find all


1068
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:48,866
the places you're using color


1069
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:51,526
and fix it all up and then still


1070
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:53,226
end up with a situation like


1071
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:55,916
this, where, for some reason,


1072
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,376
even though your text switched


1073
00:33:57,376 --> 00:33:58,856
color, there's something behind


1074
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:00,236
it that's still drawing wrong.


1075
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:03,476
And if you're stuck and can't


1076
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:06,366
figure out what to do, I suggest


1077
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:08,505
taking advantage of Xcode's View


1078
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,005
Debugger.


1079
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:10,806
I'm just going to cover this


1080
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:13,025
briefly here, and the advanced


1081
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:14,466
Dark Mode session will go into


1082
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:16,565
more detail about debugging tips


1083
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:17,116
and tricks.


1084
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:22,196
So, I can see that light view is


1085
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:24,315
actually my scroll view, and I


1086
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:26,706
had set in the interface builder


1087
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,446
to a custom gray color.


1088
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:29,936
That's why I couldn't find it


1089
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:30,946
searching through my code.


1090
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:33,936
So, I switched it to the default


1091
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,016
background color, and now


1092
00:34:36,146 --> 00:34:37,076
everything looks great.


1093
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,246
And while we're here on this


1094
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,485
text view, I'd like to go


1095
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:41,626
through some of the colors in


1096
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:43,505
play here that are dynamic


1097
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:45,136
system colors that also may be


1098
00:34:45,136 --> 00:34:45,846
useful to you.


1099
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:50,746
First, there's textColor, which


1100
00:34:50,746 --> 00:34:52,656
is switching between black and


1101
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:55,676
white; textBackgroundColors


1102
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,936
switches from white to black;


1103
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:02,116
selectedTextColor goes from


1104
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:04,496
black to white; and then


1105
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:06,346
selectedTextBackgroundColor,


1106
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,166
which is blue.


1107
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,266
But you can see it's two


1108
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,376
different versions of blue, and


1109
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,676
this is special, because it


1110
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:14,136
follows the system preference


1111
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:15,146
for the highlight color.


1112
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,616
And you can see, when the


1113
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:18,256
highlight color changes, the


1114
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:19,996
selectedTextBackgroundColor


1115
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:21,746
changes with it.


1116
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:24,896
Now, I'd like to move along and


1117
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:26,296
talk about accessibility.


1118
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:30,206
In the Accessibility display


1119
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:31,516
preferences, there's the


1120
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:33,216
Increase contrast checkbox.


1121
00:35:34,526 --> 00:35:36,316
If we turn on Increase contrast


1122
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:38,706
mode, you'll see that colors and


1123
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,176
artwork throughout the system


1124
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:42,916
change to make the UI easier to


1125
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:43,986
see for people to see with low


1126
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:44,406
vision.


1127
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:49,616
Well, now in asset catalogs, we


1128
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:52,006
can add colors specially for the


1129
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,646
high contrast appearances as


1130
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:53,966
well.


1131
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,256
So, here I've added to my header


1132
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,376
color a version for high


1133
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,306
contrast light and high contrast


1134
00:36:00,306 --> 00:36:00,586
dark.


1135
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,526
And this is how Chameleon


1136
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:06,786
Wrangler now looks in the dark


1137
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:08,226
high contrast appearance.


1138
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,276
You'll notice that not only is


1139
00:36:10,276 --> 00:36:11,666
my header color using that


1140
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,246
special color that I defined,


1141
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:15,386
the rest of the system colors


1142
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,586
are also specially defined for


1143
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:19,106
the high contrast appearances.


1144
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,256
And this is true for light high


1145
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:23,486
contrast, as well.


1146
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:28,156
Now I'd like to move along and


1147
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:29,206
talk about images.


1148
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,426
We'll take a look at the toolbar


1149
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:37,156
buttons here.


1150
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:42,286
This chameleon color picker


1151
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,666
button looks pretty good in


1152
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,976
light, but in dark, that dark


1153
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,746
outline disappears against the


1154
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:50,026
dark background of the button.


1155
00:36:51,226 --> 00:36:54,496
So, we'd like to have a special


1156
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:56,026
version of it for the dark


1157
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:58,046
appearance, and, once again, we


1158
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:59,866
turn to our asset catalog friend


1159
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,126
and add a version for the dark


1160
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:04,736
appearance.


1161
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,746
And now it looks much better


1162
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:13,586
against the dark button with the


1163
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:14,396
light outline.


1164
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:17,756
That's great for full color


1165
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:18,226
images.


1166
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:21,936
How about these other two


1167
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:22,406
buttons?


1168
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:24,726
Well, they already look pretty


1169
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:24,966
good.


1170
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:26,726
We didn't have to do anything,


1171
00:37:26,726 --> 00:37:27,906
so why?


1172
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:28,806
Why are these right?


1173
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:32,986
Well, that's because we had made


1174
00:37:33,176 --> 00:37:35,266
these images template images.


1175
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:39,216
To tell you a little bit about


1176
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:41,166
template images, in case you


1177
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,326
don't already know about them,


1178
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:45,116
it's important to understand


1179
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,296
that the transparency of each


1180
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:51,066
pixel is maintained, but the


1181
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:52,036
color is ignored.


1182
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:54,386
You can make the starting image


1183
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:55,616
any color you like, that's


1184
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:56,186
ignored.


1185
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:57,556
It's only the transparency.


1186
00:37:58,316 --> 00:37:59,946
They can be bitmaps or PDFs.


1187
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:02,716
And here's an example from the


1188
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,646
OS of the speaker volume image.


1189
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:08,046
The original image is black, and


1190
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:09,626
then it has this partially


1191
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,146
transparent section for the


1192
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:12,226
larger soundwaves.


1193
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:16,516
And if we put this image into an


1194
00:38:16,516 --> 00:38:19,866
NSImageView, it's automatically


1195
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:21,406
given the Secondary Label Color,


1196
00:38:21,406 --> 00:38:24,296
and you can see in light, it's a


1197
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:26,446
medium gray, and in dark, it's a


1198
00:38:26,446 --> 00:38:27,076
lighter gray.


1199
00:38:27,756 --> 00:38:28,596
And then the partially


1200
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:30,426
transparent areas have less


1201
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:33,956
contrast against the background.


1202
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:36,606
Another advantage of using


1203
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,786
template images is that they


1204
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:39,136
automatically pick up on the


1205
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:39,716
button state.


1206
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:43,746
When a button is disabled, the


1207
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:45,176
images are dimmer, and that's


1208
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:47,026
handled for you if you use


1209
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:47,756
template images.


1210
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:57,246
Okay. So, Chameleon Wrangler is


1211
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:58,246
now looking pretty good.


1212
00:38:58,276 --> 00:38:59,686
We got our colors sorted out.


1213
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:01,146
We got some of our images sorted


1214
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:02,986
out, but there's more to the


1215
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:04,386
application than what you see


1216
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:06,266
here, so I'd like to invite


1217
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:08,216
Taylor to the stage to tell you


1218
00:39:08,216 --> 00:39:08,986
about the rest of it.


1219
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:10,906
Thank you very much.


1220
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:15,500
[ Applause ]


1221
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:19,336
>> Thank you Rachel.


1222
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,396
Now that Rachel's covered a lot


1223
00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:22,766
of the fundamentals of having


1224
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,526
our colors and images react


1225
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:25,726
appropriately for Dark Mode,


1226
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:27,386
let's first take a look at


1227
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:28,486
applying some of those to some


1228
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:29,586
more detailed areas of our


1229
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:30,206
application.


1230
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:32,876
First up is Moodometer, where we


1231
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,746
can keep track of Chloe's mood


1232
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,046
shifts throughout the day.


1233
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:37,846
You can see here that the


1234
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:39,076
popover's background has


1235
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,646
automatically adjusted for the


1236
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,126
Dark Mode.


1237
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,706
However, the button content is


1238
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:45,576
way too dark, still, on top of


1239
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:46,126
the background.


1240
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:48,456
Taking a look at our Asa


1241
00:39:48,456 --> 00:39:50,136
Catalog, we can see that we've


1242
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:52,296
prebuilt these images with the


1243
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:53,596
color defined in the asset


1244
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:55,396
themself.


1245
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,316
So, we can use the technique


1246
00:39:56,316 --> 00:39:57,776
that Rachel showed us, where we


1247
00:39:57,776 --> 00:39:59,106
add a dark variant for those


1248
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,086
images with a lighter color.


1249
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:03,646
However, it's kind of


1250
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:05,016
unfortunate that we're only


1251
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,296
varying the fill color of these


1252
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:07,806
images but keeping the same


1253
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:08,136
shape.


1254
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,206
So, there's probably a better


1255
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:13,016
way, and, in Mojave, there is,


1256
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:14,936
using this contentTintColor API.


1257
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:17,826
With this, you can create a


1258
00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:19,566
template image and provide a


1259
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:21,106
custom tint color to be used


1260
00:40:21,106 --> 00:40:21,946
instead of the default


1261
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:22,906
appearance sensitive one.


1262
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:24,666
That will be used as the base


1263
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,476
fill color for any of the places


1264
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:27,716
that the image appears.


1265
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,416
So, we can set the content tint


1266
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:32,326
color on an NSImageView to tint


1267
00:40:32,426 --> 00:40:34,786
its image or on an NSButton to


1268
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:36,316
tint both its boot image and


1269
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:36,616
title.


1270
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,226
So, let's take a look at


1271
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:40,026
adopting this.


1272
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:41,486
The first step here is to


1273
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:42,976
convert these to simple template


1274
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:45,026
images and remember to set the


1275
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,896
render mode to be the template


1276
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:47,306
effect.


1277
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:49,426
Taking a look at Chameleon


1278
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:50,816
Wrangler now, we can see that


1279
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,316
these images are now getting the


1280
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,906
default templating effect, which


1281
00:40:53,906 --> 00:40:55,786
looks great in Dark Mode, but


1282
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:56,896
the next step is going to be


1283
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:57,926
applying that color.


1284
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:00,426
So, we could just pull the color


1285
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:02,296
out of the asset, add a dark


1286
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,946
variant, and set the


1287
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:05,096
contentTintColor on these


1288
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:06,616
buttons to be that named color.


1289
00:41:06,616 --> 00:41:08,506
And this button will


1290
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:09,726
automatically pick the right


1291
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:10,986
variant based on whether it's


1292
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:11,716
appearing in the light


1293
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:14,256
appearance or dark appearance.


1294
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:15,656
However, Rachel also showed us


1295
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:16,366
how there are a number of


1296
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:18,306
colorful system colors that


1297
00:41:18,306 --> 00:41:19,456
already have these light and


1298
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:20,926
dark variants, which we could


1299
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:21,556
use instead.


1300
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:24,646
For instance, we could use


1301
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,416
systemRed, systemYellow, and


1302
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,806
systemGreen, which, if we return


1303
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:29,986
back to Chameleon Wrangler, we


1304
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:31,626
can see looks really great and


1305
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:33,596
has those buttons pop on top of


1306
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:34,196
that background.


1307
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:36,816
What's really cool about this


1308
00:41:36,816 --> 00:41:39,086
combination is that not only do


1309
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:41,306
we get a very specific green


1310
00:41:41,306 --> 00:41:42,686
color for both Light and Dark


1311
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:44,686
Mode, but with the content tint


1312
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:46,496
API, the system effects applied


1313
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,226
on top of that vary based on


1314
00:41:48,226 --> 00:41:49,046
appearance as well.


1315
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:51,666
As Raymond discussed, in the


1316
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,856
light appearance, there's a


1317
00:41:52,856 --> 00:41:54,316
darkening effect on top of that


1318
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:55,086
base tint color.


1319
00:41:55,686 --> 00:41:56,436
Meanwhile, in the dark


1320
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:57,406
appearance, there's a


1321
00:41:57,406 --> 00:41:58,966
brightening effect.


1322
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,776
All of these effects are further


1323
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,306
customized for the increased


1324
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:06,266
contrast setting without any


1325
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:07,566
changes from our application.


1326
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,446
So, it's really great that we


1327
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,156
didn't have to specify all 12 of


1328
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:11,936
these colors.


1329
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:13,226
And instead, we specified a


1330
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:14,786
single one and, thanks to


1331
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:16,046
dynamic system colors and


1332
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:17,766
dynamic system effects, we got


1333
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:18,936
all of this completely


1334
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:19,586
automatically.


1335
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:23,616
So, our Moodometer is looking


1336
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:23,956
great.


1337
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:25,946
Next, we can step over to


1338
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,356
another type of app where we


1339
00:42:27,356 --> 00:42:28,646
keep track of very important


1340
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,506
information about Chloe, such as


1341
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,166
how stressed she's feeling or


1342
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,436
more importantly, what's her


1343
00:42:33,436 --> 00:42:34,386
favorite type of berry?


1344
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:36,926
We can see here that this


1345
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:38,226
already looks great, because we


1346
00:42:38,226 --> 00:42:40,916
are using stock Cocoa controls,


1347
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,446
which automatically adjust for


1348
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:43,006
Dark Mode.


1349
00:42:44,316 --> 00:42:46,206
We can see how it reacts to the


1350
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:47,256
accent color feature that


1351
00:42:47,256 --> 00:42:48,896
Raymond talked about by opening


1352
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:50,876
up system preferences, changing


1353
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:52,336
the color to a nice chameleon


1354
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,216
striped yellow, and returning


1355
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:55,466
back to Chameleon Wrangler.


1356
00:42:56,596 --> 00:42:57,666
We can, again, see that the


1357
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:59,436
built-in controls automatically


1358
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:00,886
adjust to that yellow accent


1359
00:43:00,886 --> 00:43:02,816
color, including the focus ring


1360
00:43:02,926 --> 00:43:03,736
and highlight color.


1361
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:05,976
However, we can notice that our


1362
00:43:05,976 --> 00:43:07,546
custom tab bar has remained


1363
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,146
blue, even though we've changed


1364
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:09,756
the accent color.


1365
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,366
Because this blue doesn't really


1366
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:13,636
have any significance for our


1367
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:15,356
application, we probably want it


1368
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:17,586
to be following that accent


1369
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:18,716
color.


1370
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,136
Like Rachel talked about, we


1371
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:21,876
have a few different colors that


1372
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:23,786
will follow the users' accent


1373
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:24,896
and highlight color selection.


1374
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:27,396
New in Mojave is a control


1375
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,186
accent color, which you can use


1376
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:31,166
to directly mimic the accented


1377
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,096
areas on system controls, such


1378
00:43:33,096 --> 00:43:34,536
as the sides of popup buttons,


1379
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,386
default push buttons, or the


1380
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:37,706
selected segment of a segmented


1381
00:43:37,706 --> 00:43:38,126
control.


1382
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:40,936
There's also selected content


1383
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:41,926
background color, which is what


1384
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:43,006
you see in the background of


1385
00:43:43,006 --> 00:43:44,586
selected table rows, and you can


1386
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:45,556
use to indicate custom


1387
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,136
selection.


1388
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:48,486
And selected text background


1389
00:43:48,486 --> 00:43:50,366
color is exactly what it sounds


1390
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:50,616
like.


1391
00:43:51,136 --> 00:43:53,606
So, going back to our app, we


1392
00:43:53,606 --> 00:43:54,906
can see that we're using system


1393
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:56,506
blue color for this custom tab


1394
00:43:56,506 --> 00:43:58,376
selection, and, instead, we can


1395
00:43:58,376 --> 00:43:59,696
just swap that over to using


1396
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:00,756
controlAccentColor.


1397
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:04,046
The next problem here with the


1398
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:05,516
tab bar is a little more subtle.


1399
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:07,956
If we bring our cursor over and


1400
00:44:08,056 --> 00:44:10,046
press down on it, we can see


1401
00:44:10,046 --> 00:44:11,086
that we're getting a darkening


1402
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:12,406
effect instead of the


1403
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:13,546
brightening effect that we


1404
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:14,586
should in Dark Mode.


1405
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:16,986
This is because we are taking


1406
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:18,256
that base color and just


1407
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,006
applying a constant 30%


1408
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:21,856
darkening effect to it, assuming


1409
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:23,116
that would look fine in the


1410
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:24,506
light appearance.


1411
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:27,356
Instead, we want to describe


1412
00:44:27,356 --> 00:44:28,666
something that basically this


1413
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,976
color is being pressed, and that


1414
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:33,726
semantic description can carry


1415
00:44:33,726 --> 00:44:35,316
whatever effect it needs to in


1416
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:36,176
the light versus dark


1417
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:37,416
appearance.


1418
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:38,596
So, with the new system effect


1419
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:41,546
API in Mojave on NSColor, we can


1420
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:42,946
describe that exact semantic.


1421
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:45,036
We can take our base color of


1422
00:44:45,036 --> 00:44:46,806
controlAccentColor, say that we


1423
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:47,876
want to get the pressed variant,


1424
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,656
and it will react appropriately


1425
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:51,026
in both the light and dark


1426
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,246
appearance.


1427
00:44:54,936 --> 00:44:56,316
There's one more area of our


1428
00:44:56,316 --> 00:44:57,726
application where you can see


1429
00:44:57,836 --> 00:44:59,586
the accent color, and that's in


1430
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:01,076
this photo browser where we draw


1431
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,406
a selection ring around the


1432
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:03,816
selected photo.


1433
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:06,126
Here, we were using the


1434
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:08,026
selectedContentBackgroundColor,


1435
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:09,576
and that, again, automatically


1436
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,066
adjusts based on the user's


1437
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:12,056
selected accent.


1438
00:45:13,846 --> 00:45:14,696
Let's open up one of these


1439
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:15,986
photos and take a look at a


1440
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:17,956
nice, big, beautiful photo of


1441
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:18,336
Chloe.


1442
00:45:19,056 --> 00:45:21,396
The first thing that stands out


1443
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:22,636
is the fact that the background


1444
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,436
has not adjusted for Dark Mode.


1445
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:26,276
It's still using its light


1446
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:28,256
translucency effect similar to a


1447
00:45:28,256 --> 00:45:29,106
hardcoded color.


1448
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,066
This effect is provided by


1449
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:33,896
NSVisualEfffectView, which


1450
00:45:33,926 --> 00:45:35,246
provides the translucent blur


1451
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:36,616
materials you see across the


1452
00:45:36,616 --> 00:45:37,026
system.


1453
00:45:37,186 --> 00:45:38,766
For instance, there's the


1454
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:40,236
sidebars which blur onto the


1455
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:41,736
desktop and other windows behind


1456
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:43,446
it, as well as things like the


1457
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:44,886
title bar, which blur the


1458
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:45,886
content that's scrolled


1459
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:47,066
underneath.


1460
00:45:47,966 --> 00:45:50,226
NSVisualEffectView also enables


1461
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:51,566
the vibrant foreground blending,


1462
00:45:51,866 --> 00:45:53,636
that Raymond talked about, by


1463
00:45:53,636 --> 00:45:55,586
taking a grayscale color plus a


1464
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,206
Blend Mode and making it really


1465
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:58,846
pop on top of these backgrounds.


1466
00:45:59,826 --> 00:46:00,906
The advanced Dark Mode talk is


1467
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:01,756
going to go into a lot more


1468
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,036
detail about how you can use


1469
00:46:03,036 --> 00:46:04,366
those blend modes effectively.


1470
00:46:06,686 --> 00:46:08,046
Turns out that a lot of places


1471
00:46:08,046 --> 00:46:09,256
automatically get these blur


1472
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:10,676
materials for free.


1473
00:46:10,856 --> 00:46:12,916
For instance, every titlebar of


1474
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,326
an NSWindow will automatically


1475
00:46:14,326 --> 00:46:16,006
have a titlebar material showing


1476
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,706
onto the content behind it.


1477
00:46:18,496 --> 00:46:20,156
Source list table views and


1478
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:21,756
sidebar style split-view items


1479
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:23,286
will automatically get a sidebar


1480
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:24,866
material showing onto the


1481
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,166
content behind the window.


1482
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:29,436
For custom UIs it's pretty easy


1483
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:30,616
to build these custom effects


1484
00:46:30,616 --> 00:46:31,426
ourselves, as well.


1485
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,326
But the most important quality


1486
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:34,726
of them are the material that


1487
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:36,276
you choose to have them


1488
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:36,776
represent.


1489
00:46:37,976 --> 00:46:39,406
We have a few nonsemantic


1490
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:41,256
materials, which, like hardcoded


1491
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,126
colors, just describe the exact


1492
00:46:43,126 --> 00:46:44,536
visual quality of the material


1493
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,256
and not the intent of what


1494
00:46:46,256 --> 00:46:47,126
you're trying to represent.


1495
00:46:48,086 --> 00:46:49,536
These will not be adjusted for


1496
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:50,786
Dark Mode and will stay with


1497
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:51,866
that exact quality.


1498
00:46:53,066 --> 00:46:54,106
However, we have a number of


1499
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,486
semantic materials, as well,


1500
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:57,346
which allow you to describe what


1501
00:46:57,346 --> 00:46:59,126
type of UI your custom UI is


1502
00:46:59,256 --> 00:47:00,216
intending to represent.


1503
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:02,226
For instance, for a custom menu


1504
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:03,426
like UI, you would want to use


1505
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:04,296
the menu material.


1506
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,196
And these not only adjust for


1507
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:07,976
Dark Mode, but guarantee that UI


1508
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:10,246
to always match those materials


1509
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:11,556
even when the system changes in


1510
00:47:11,556 --> 00:47:11,986
the future.


1511
00:47:13,156 --> 00:47:14,236
We've had a few of these in the


1512
00:47:14,236 --> 00:47:16,646
past, but in Mojave, we have


1513
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:17,966
several more so that you can


1514
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:19,346
make sure to really tailor your


1515
00:47:19,346 --> 00:47:21,496
custom UI to match the material


1516
00:47:21,596 --> 00:47:24,936
it needs to.


1517
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,506
Jumping back to our photo here,


1518
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:27,516
we can see that we were using


1519
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:28,706
the mediumLight material,


1520
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:29,776
because we were trying to


1521
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:31,496
represent Quick Look style


1522
00:47:31,496 --> 00:47:32,426
popover windows.


1523
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:34,296
And instead, we can just simply


1524
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:35,556
swap that over to the popover


1525
00:47:35,556 --> 00:47:37,206
material and get the exact


1526
00:47:37,206 --> 00:47:41,046
effect we want to in Dark Mode.


1527
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:42,856
Now, this isn't the only area


1528
00:47:42,856 --> 00:47:45,076
where we get a unique material


1529
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:46,366
showing in the background of our


1530
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:46,516
UI.


1531
00:47:46,516 --> 00:47:48,666
Like Raymond talked about,


1532
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,146
there's this desktop tinting


1533
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:51,596
effect that's shown here in the


1534
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:52,916
background of our photo gallery.


1535
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:54,306
We're getting a little bit of


1536
00:47:54,306 --> 00:47:55,396
that blue from that desktop


1537
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:57,146
behind it, creating this really


1538
00:47:57,146 --> 00:47:58,486
visually harmonious result.


1539
00:47:59,516 --> 00:48:00,836
It's a lot easier to see on top


1540
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,066
of a more vibrant background,


1541
00:48:02,206 --> 00:48:03,686
such as these beautiful flower


1542
00:48:03,686 --> 00:48:04,236
pictures.


1543
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,626
There's three different variants


1544
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,806
that have semantics with these


1545
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:11,866
background materials.


1546
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,436
There's the window backgrounds


1547
00:48:13,436 --> 00:48:14,616
that we see on the backgrounds


1548
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:16,596
of generic windows; Under Page


1549
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:18,456
Background, which appears behind


1550
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:19,676
document areas such as in


1551
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:20,906
Preview or Keynote.


1552
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:23,726
And perhaps most commonly is the


1553
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:25,146
Content Background material,


1554
00:48:25,726 --> 00:48:26,656
which is white in light


1555
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:28,306
appearance and, of course, dark


1556
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:29,206
in the dark appearance.


1557
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,216
In fact, all of these are now


1558
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:32,676
dark in the dark appearance but


1559
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,306
also have that wallpaper tinting


1560
00:48:34,366 --> 00:48:36,866
effect.


1561
00:48:36,866 --> 00:48:37,766
The great news is that it's


1562
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:38,956
really not hard to get these


1563
00:48:38,956 --> 00:48:39,546
effects.


1564
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:41,086
For the most part, it comes


1565
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:42,396
completely automatically by


1566
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:43,496
using system views.


1567
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:45,076
For instance, the default


1568
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:47,016
backgrounds of every window has


1569
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:48,396
that window background material


1570
00:48:48,556 --> 00:48:49,116
built right in.


1571
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:52,336
In addition, [inaudible] views


1572
00:48:52,336 --> 00:48:54,946
such as NSCollectionView or


1573
00:48:54,946 --> 00:48:57,016
NSTableView also automatically


1574
00:48:57,016 --> 00:48:58,246
come with the content background


1575
00:48:58,246 --> 00:48:59,516
material built right in.


1576
00:49:00,776 --> 00:49:01,776
We've seen a number of places


1577
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:02,826
across this system that were


1578
00:49:02,826 --> 00:49:04,196
actually able to improve their


1579
00:49:04,196 --> 00:49:05,996
Dark Mode support by deleting an


1580
00:49:05,996 --> 00:49:07,916
override of these default colors


1581
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:09,186
that these views have.


1582
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:12,546
If you want to customize beyond


1583
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:13,816
the default color that these


1584
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:15,666
views have, you can explicitly


1585
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:17,556
set a variety of system colors


1586
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:19,346
as their background color to get


1587
00:49:19,346 --> 00:49:20,926
the exact material effect you


1588
00:49:20,926 --> 00:49:21,216
want.


1589
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,446
One really important note here,


1590
00:49:24,446 --> 00:49:25,986
though, is that if you were to


1591
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:27,396
read the RGB values of these


1592
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:29,166
colors, they would not include


1593
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:29,946
the desktop tint.


1594
00:49:30,836 --> 00:49:31,796
This is because, as Raymond


1595
00:49:31,796 --> 00:49:32,816
mentioned, this tint is


1596
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:33,876
extremely dynamic.


1597
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:35,606
As you move your window around


1598
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:36,956
on screen, that's getting


1599
00:49:36,956 --> 00:49:38,596
updated asynchronously to the


1600
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:40,576
applications rendering itself,


1601
00:49:40,576 --> 00:49:41,536
creating a really nice


1602
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:43,456
experience as the user is moving


1603
00:49:43,456 --> 00:49:44,336
around windows.


1604
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:46,886
So, jumping back to Chameleon


1605
00:49:46,886 --> 00:49:48,396
Wrangler, we automatically got


1606
00:49:48,396 --> 00:49:49,976
this content background because


1607
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:51,226
we just use a stock


1608
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:52,006
NSCollectionView.


1609
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:55,006
In the vital section, we got


1610
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:56,196
that window background material


1611
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:57,466
showing through because we had


1612
00:49:57,466 --> 00:49:58,996
nothing opaque covering it up.


1613
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:02,006
However, in our notes section,


1614
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:03,296
where we have this awesome


1615
00:50:03,296 --> 00:50:05,836
custom stationary, we have a


1616
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,426
light grey background that isn't


1617
00:50:07,426 --> 00:50:08,456
appropriate for Dark Mode and


1618
00:50:08,456 --> 00:50:10,016
hasn't been adjusted with that


1619
00:50:10,016 --> 00:50:11,096
under page semantic.


1620
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:14,366
We can open up Interface Builder


1621
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:15,436
and see where we're setting up


1622
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:17,056
this background drawing view and


1623
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,756
see that, indeed, we are filing


1624
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:19,976
it with a custom gray color.


1625
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:23,356
And pretty quickly in IB, we can


1626
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:24,486
change that to using the Under


1627
00:50:24,486 --> 00:50:25,986
Page Background color that


1628
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,626
represents that semantic and


1629
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:28,626
immediately see that we'll get


1630
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:30,696
the right result, making it look


1631
00:50:31,116 --> 00:50:32,286
just at home with the rest of


1632
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:34,646
the document apps in Dark Mode.


1633
00:50:34,646 --> 00:50:37,516
The next thing that kind of


1634
00:50:37,516 --> 00:50:38,636
stands out here, though, is the


1635
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,156
dark foreground on top of light


1636
00:50:40,156 --> 00:50:42,376
background of our stationary and


1637
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:43,036
document area.


1638
00:50:43,036 --> 00:50:45,276
And because this is a WYSIWYG


1639
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:47,206
editor where we, as users of


1640
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,676
Chameleon Wrangler have complete


1641
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:51,276
control over the colors, images,


1642
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:53,876
and fonts seen within it, we


1643
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,846
expect this to stay the same as


1644
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:57,356
a light appearing document.


1645
00:50:58,566 --> 00:50:59,656
However, there are a few subtle


1646
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,406
details that don't seem quite


1647
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:01,696
right.


1648
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:04,026
For instance, the text highlight


1649
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:05,436
color is still getting the dark


1650
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:07,266
variant of the text highlights,


1651
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:08,546
as well as the autocorrect


1652
00:51:08,546 --> 00:51:09,846
bubbles have the dark


1653
00:51:09,846 --> 00:51:11,376
appearance, which really clashes


1654
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:12,396
with the light appearance of our


1655
00:51:12,396 --> 00:51:12,866
document.


1656
00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:15,186
We, basically, want to have


1657
00:51:15,186 --> 00:51:16,776
everything in this area revert


1658
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,646
back to the light appearance,


1659
00:51:19,146 --> 00:51:20,696
and we can do that using


1660
00:51:20,756 --> 00:51:22,066
NSAppearance.


1661
00:51:22,406 --> 00:51:23,636
It turns out that NSAppearance


1662
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:24,636
is what's been providing the


1663
00:51:24,636 --> 00:51:26,466
magic of having light versus


1664
00:51:26,466 --> 00:51:27,786
dark variance automatically


1665
00:51:27,786 --> 00:51:29,306
switch in Dark Mode this whole


1666
00:51:29,306 --> 00:51:29,646
time.


1667
00:51:30,806 --> 00:51:31,746
You can conceptualize


1668
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:33,396
NSAppearance as a little bundle


1669
00:51:33,816 --> 00:51:35,526
containing all of the colors,


1670
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:39,176
materials, images, and control


1671
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:40,486
artwork that you see across the


1672
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:41,026
system.


1673
00:51:41,626 --> 00:51:44,176
Now, when your application does


1674
00:51:44,176 --> 00:51:45,586
something like request to draw


1675
00:51:45,586 --> 00:51:47,296
with labelColor, what that does


1676
00:51:47,296 --> 00:51:48,476
is it looks up in the current


1677
00:51:48,476 --> 00:51:50,016
appearance for what the exact


1678
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:51,166
RGB values should be.


1679
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:53,526
The same is true for control


1680
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:54,696
artwork or the different


1681
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:56,266
material effects.


1682
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,996
Now, what's new in Mojave is the


1683
00:51:58,996 --> 00:52:00,546
dark appearance, which our


1684
00:52:00,546 --> 00:52:01,876
designers have meticulously


1685
00:52:01,876 --> 00:52:03,976
crafted with redefining


1686
00:52:03,976 --> 00:52:05,406
everything across the system.


1687
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:07,886
When the system is running in


1688
00:52:07,886 --> 00:52:09,416
Dark Mode, what happens is that


1689
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:10,586
the dark appearance gets applied


1690
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,916
to your application instead of


1691
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:13,306
the light appearance.


1692
00:52:13,406 --> 00:52:14,776
So, when labelColor goes to draw


1693
00:52:14,776 --> 00:52:16,376
itself, it references the dark


1694
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:18,036
appearance as white value


1695
00:52:18,076 --> 00:52:19,146
instead of the light appearance


1696
00:52:19,146 --> 00:52:19,866
as darker value.


1697
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:21,666
The same is true for all of


1698
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:22,526
those materials.


1699
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,916
And these aren't the only


1700
00:52:25,006 --> 00:52:26,376
materials in the system.


1701
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,856
Right, these aren't the only


1702
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:28,836
appearances in the system.


1703
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:30,466
There are also the high contrast


1704
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:32,216
appearances, which get used when


1705
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:33,486
the accessibility high contrast


1706
00:52:33,486 --> 00:52:35,046
setting is turned on, these will


1707
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:36,266
get applied to your application


1708
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:36,666
instead.


1709
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:38,906
And there's actually even more.


1710
00:52:39,316 --> 00:52:40,026
There are the vibrant


1711
00:52:40,026 --> 00:52:40,976
appearances that, again,


1712
00:52:40,976 --> 00:52:42,366
completely redefine all of these


1713
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:44,536
colors that appear in sidebars


1714
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,416
and titlebars.


1715
00:52:45,946 --> 00:52:48,046
And the advanced Dark Mode talk


1716
00:52:48,046 --> 00:52:49,106
is going to go into more detail


1717
00:52:49,106 --> 00:52:50,156
about how you can effectively


1718
00:52:50,156 --> 00:52:51,746
use the assets that come out of


1719
00:52:51,746 --> 00:52:53,216
those vibrant appearances to


1720
00:52:53,216 --> 00:52:54,336
really make them stand out.


1721
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:59,706
Now, by default, the appearance


1722
00:52:59,706 --> 00:53:01,196
of your application will follow


1723
00:53:01,196 --> 00:53:01,686
the system.


1724
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:03,386
However, you can explicitly


1725
00:53:03,386 --> 00:53:04,536
override it by setting the


1726
00:53:04,536 --> 00:53:05,706
appearance property to whatever


1727
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:06,076
you want.


1728
00:53:06,496 --> 00:53:08,196
So, here we have Chameleon


1729
00:53:08,196 --> 00:53:09,496
Wrangler in Light and Dark Mode,


1730
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:11,536
and we can see it's following


1731
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:12,956
the system, but as soon as we


1732
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,066
set its appearance to always be


1733
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,716
darkAqua, we can see it's always


1734
00:53:15,716 --> 00:53:16,876
getting that dark appearance.


1735
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,326
The inverse is true by setting


1736
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:21,266
the explicitly light appearance,


1737
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,246
and, of course, setting it back


1738
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:23,756
to nil will have it return back


1739
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:25,126
to the default behavior of


1740
00:53:25,126 --> 00:53:25,926
following the system.


1741
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,996
Now, we know that after a lot of


1742
00:53:29,036 --> 00:53:30,766
you see your apps running in


1743
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:32,296
Dark Mode, you're going to be


1744
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,916
really tempted to have your app


1745
00:53:34,216 --> 00:53:35,466
always be dark, because it's


1746
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:36,446
just going to look so good.


1747
00:53:37,586 --> 00:53:39,246
But like Raymond mentioned, it's


1748
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:40,666
really important to keep in mind


1749
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,136
"When it is appropriate to have


1750
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,686
an always dark app?"


1751
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:45,586
This should be generally


1752
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:47,326
reserved for very media focused


1753
00:53:47,326 --> 00:53:49,036
apps like QuickTime player or


1754
00:53:49,036 --> 00:53:50,446
professional color-sensitive


1755
00:53:50,446 --> 00:53:51,766
workflow apps, where it's


1756
00:53:51,766 --> 00:53:53,146
important to eliminate all of


1757
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,546
the light behind the content.


1758
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:56,476
And, in general, it should be


1759
00:53:56,476 --> 00:53:57,916
left up to a choice for the


1760
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:58,356
user.


1761
00:53:59,546 --> 00:54:00,536
So, in general, this is the


1762
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:01,506
system preference.


1763
00:54:01,716 --> 00:54:02,926
Some of you maybe already have a


1764
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:04,086
dark theme for your application


1765
00:54:04,086 --> 00:54:05,476
controlled via app preference,


1766
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:06,796
so your first step would be to


1767
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:07,916
tie that back to the system


1768
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:10,156
preference so the people using


1769
00:54:10,156 --> 00:54:11,426
the system can have a consistent


1770
00:54:11,426 --> 00:54:12,786
experience.


1771
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:15,056
And in some ambiguous cases like


1772
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:16,286
Raymond mentioned, there may be


1773
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,356
some additional need for an


1774
00:54:17,356 --> 00:54:18,566
in-app preference, such as in


1775
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:20,296
the mail case, but for the most


1776
00:54:20,296 --> 00:54:21,606
part, the system preference


1777
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:23,456
should be exactly what users go


1778
00:54:23,456 --> 00:54:23,706
for.


1779
00:54:23,706 --> 00:54:26,466
If you do decide you need to


1780
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:27,876
have an always dark application,


1781
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:29,276
it's really important to not to


1782
00:54:29,276 --> 00:54:30,486
use the Vibrant Dark appearance


1783
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:31,926
on the entire window, because


1784
00:54:31,926 --> 00:54:33,196
that's not appropriate for the


1785
00:54:33,196 --> 00:54:35,416
opaque window areas of the


1786
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:37,136
application and are really only


1787
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:38,266
intended for sidebars.


1788
00:54:39,316 --> 00:54:40,226
Instead, you want to use the


1789
00:54:40,226 --> 00:54:41,866
Dark Aqua appearance if you want


1790
00:54:41,866 --> 00:54:43,746
to have that always dark look.


1791
00:54:44,596 --> 00:54:46,096
In addition to be able to be set


1792
00:54:46,096 --> 00:54:47,626
on the window as a whole, you


1793
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:49,046
can also set it on an individual


1794
00:54:49,046 --> 00:54:50,276
window or view scoping, and


1795
00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:51,826
that's inherited by all of the


1796
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:52,856
views contained within it.


1797
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,086
For instance, here, we're


1798
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:56,506
setting the sidebar to always


1799
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:58,736
have the darkAqua appearance if


1800
00:54:58,736 --> 00:54:59,506
we want to experiment with


1801
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:00,176
something like that.


1802
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:01,966
And all of the text and images


1803
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,646
within that also get that dark


1804
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:05,946
styling, but we can also use


1805
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:07,356
this to fix the problem we had


1806
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:08,916
before with our text area.


1807
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:11,786
We can see here that we actually


1808
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:13,316
want this entire document area


1809
00:55:13,386 --> 00:55:14,486
to remain having a light


1810
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:16,086
appearance, and so by setting


1811
00:55:16,086 --> 00:55:17,536
the lightAqua appearance, we can


1812
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:18,406
make sure that the text


1813
00:55:18,406 --> 00:55:19,826
highlighting color gets the


1814
00:55:19,826 --> 00:55:21,426
correct appearance as well as


1815
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:22,466
the autocorrect bubble


1816
00:55:22,676 --> 00:55:24,196
inheriting that light appearance


1817
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:24,556
as well.


1818
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:27,546
However, in addition to be able


1819
00:55:27,546 --> 00:55:28,756
to be used for some really cool


1820
00:55:28,756 --> 00:55:30,426
effects, it can also lead to


1821
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:31,966
some hard-to-debug situations.


1822
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:34,386
For instance, here, we're using


1823
00:55:34,386 --> 00:55:35,336
the vibrantLight appearance


1824
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:36,656
explicitly on our table view,


1825
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:38,546
and that looks perfectly fine in


1826
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:39,786
the light appearance, where it's


1827
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:41,366
actually already inheriting the


1828
00:55:41,366 --> 00:55:43,546
vibrantLight appearance.


1829
00:55:43,546 --> 00:55:44,806
In Dark Mode, this quickly


1830
00:55:44,806 --> 00:55:46,586
becomes a very visible problem.


1831
00:55:47,226 --> 00:55:48,426
We can see that the text and


1832
00:55:48,426 --> 00:55:49,866
images inside that table view


1833
00:55:49,866 --> 00:55:50,876
are now inheriting that


1834
00:55:50,876 --> 00:55:52,636
vibrantLight appearance and look


1835
00:55:52,636 --> 00:55:53,936
bad on top of that dark


1836
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:54,356
background.


1837
00:55:54,356 --> 00:55:56,386
So, for the most part, we just


1838
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,516
want to remove these explicit


1839
00:55:57,516 --> 00:55:59,126
overrides in places where we


1840
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:00,776
really do not intend to have an


1841
00:56:00,776 --> 00:56:01,986
always light appearance.


1842
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,416
This can also happen in


1843
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:06,116
Interface Builder, where, at the


1844
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,606
very bottom of the Attributes


1845
00:56:07,606 --> 00:56:09,196
Inspector, we've accidentally


1846
00:56:09,196 --> 00:56:11,006
overridden the appearance for


1847
00:56:11,156 --> 00:56:12,656
our outline view to always be


1848
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:14,696
the light Aqua appearance.


1849
00:56:14,696 --> 00:56:15,856
Here, the fix is simply to


1850
00:56:15,856 --> 00:56:18,796
change it back to the inherited


1851
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:20,196
style so that it can make sure


1852
00:56:20,196 --> 00:56:21,786
to follow Dark Mode when that's


1853
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,786
turned on, so do be sure to


1854
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:24,736
check for all of those.


1855
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:28,476
At this point, Chameleon


1856
00:56:28,476 --> 00:56:29,956
Wrangler's looking really great


1857
00:56:29,956 --> 00:56:30,686
in Dark Mode.


1858
00:56:31,896 --> 00:56:33,226
But kind of an understated thing


1859
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,546
here is that, at this point,


1860
00:56:35,686 --> 00:56:37,366
we've written 0 lines of code


1861
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:38,876
specific to Dark Mode.


1862
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:41,436
The types of changes necessary


1863
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:42,556
for being a great Dark Mode


1864
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:44,706
citizen is that you need to make


1865
00:56:44,706 --> 00:56:46,756
sure to express the ideas


1866
00:56:46,756 --> 00:56:48,556
semantically rather than


1867
00:56:48,556 --> 00:56:49,006
literally.


1868
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:52,926
So, for instance, these same


1869
00:56:52,926 --> 00:56:54,156
sets of changes allowed our


1870
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:56,686
application to not only look


1871
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,966
great in Dark Mode but also in


1872
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:00,386
the light appearance.


1873
00:57:00,786 --> 00:57:01,976
Adding support for things like


1874
00:57:01,976 --> 00:57:03,416
the accent color as well as


1875
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:04,616
making our label colors more


1876
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:05,756
consistent with the rest of the


1877
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:06,146
system.


1878
00:57:07,436 --> 00:57:09,246
Further, these same sets of


1879
00:57:09,246 --> 00:57:11,196
changes needed to be great in


1880
00:57:11,196 --> 00:57:13,446
Dark Mode are also the same sets


1881
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:15,146
of changes needed to have great


1882
00:57:15,146 --> 00:57:16,906
support for the high contrast


1883
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,056
accessibility setting.


1884
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:20,916
So, to reiterate what those


1885
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:22,436
steps were, the first and


1886
00:57:22,436 --> 00:57:24,166
foremost was linking on the


1887
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:27,636
10.14 SDK using Xcode 10.


1888
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:29,536
For a handful of apps that


1889
00:57:29,536 --> 00:57:30,966
already use system controls and


1890
00:57:30,966 --> 00:57:32,986
system colors, this is the only


1891
00:57:32,986 --> 00:57:34,026
step that's going to be needed,


1892
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,476
and it's already going to look


1893
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:36,306
great in Dark Mode.


1894
00:57:36,846 --> 00:57:38,646
For the rest of us, the next


1895
00:57:38,646 --> 00:57:40,536
step is to audit our app for the


1896
00:57:40,536 --> 00:57:42,056
use of static colors,


1897
00:57:42,736 --> 00:57:44,506
non-template images, and


1898
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,376
nonsemantic materials, and


1899
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:47,526
replace those as appropriate.


1900
00:57:47,526 --> 00:57:49,396
For instance, this might be


1901
00:57:49,396 --> 00:57:51,276
using a system color, a semantic


1902
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:53,216
material, or, in some cases,


1903
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:54,686
defining a custom asset catalog


1904
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:55,686
color or image.


1905
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:57,416
And, again, it's important to


1906
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:58,326
keep an eye out for those


1907
00:57:58,326 --> 00:58:00,216
accidental appearance overrides.


1908
00:58:01,676 --> 00:58:02,676
The advanced Dark Mode talk is


1909
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:03,636
going to go into a lot more


1910
00:58:03,636 --> 00:58:05,606
detail here, including how to


1911
00:58:05,926 --> 00:58:07,636
correctly use NSAppearance, how


1912
00:58:07,636 --> 00:58:09,376
to do custom drawing and effects


1913
00:58:09,456 --> 00:58:11,426
within NSVisualEffectView, how


1914
00:58:11,426 --> 00:58:12,526
to make sure all of the myriad


1915
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:13,716
of ways you might be drawing


1916
00:58:13,716 --> 00:58:15,526
custom views work correctly in


1917
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:15,996
Dark Mode.


1918
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:19,076
Some tips and tricks for using


1919
00:58:19,076 --> 00:58:20,146
View Debugger and Interface


1920
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:21,396
Builder to really polish your


1921
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:21,566
app.


1922
00:58:22,186 --> 00:58:24,136
And because we know that a lot


1923
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:25,906
of you and your apps' fans are


1924
00:58:25,906 --> 00:58:26,776
really going to be wanting to


1925
00:58:26,776 --> 00:58:28,006
have Dark Mode as soon as


1926
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:29,696
possible, we want to make sure


1927
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:30,806
you can do that without


1928
00:58:30,806 --> 00:58:32,336
sacrificing how far you can back


1929
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:32,736
deploy.


1930
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:34,716
So, in general, a lot of these


1931
00:58:34,716 --> 00:58:35,846
features are available for a


1932
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:37,866
year or more, but the advanced


1933
00:58:37,866 --> 00:58:38,876
talk is going to go into details


1934
00:58:38,876 --> 00:58:39,856
about how to take that even


1935
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:40,486
further back.


1936
00:58:41,096 --> 00:58:44,266
We have a few Cocoa Labs, but I


1937
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:45,226
also really want to point out


1938
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:46,356
the Dark Mode Lab, where, in


1939
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,746
addition to engineering support,


1940
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:49,416
Raymond and other members of the


1941
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:50,446
design team will be there to


1942
00:58:50,446 --> 00:58:51,896
help answer any design questions


1943
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:52,686
you might have, as well.


1944
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:54,066
So, that's a really special


1945
00:58:54,066 --> 00:58:55,476
treat that I encourage you to


1946
00:58:55,476 --> 00:58:55,996
take a look at.


1947
00:58:55,996 --> 00:58:58,826
Thanks for staying until 6:00


1948
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,596
today, and have a great rest of


1949
00:59:00,596 --> 00:59:01,246
the WWDC.
