Read Me About AVCamDemo
========================
1.0

AVCamDemo is a simple demonstration of how to use the AVFoundation capture APIs for audio, video, and still image capture. It also includes camera controls in the HUD for torch, flash, focus, expose, and white balance. The HUD includes a view with on/off lights showing when the focus, expose, or white balance are adjusting. There is support for single-tap to focus at a specific point, double-tap to expose at a specific point, and triple-tap to re-center the focus and expose boxes. The Grav button allows cycling through the video preview layers gravity settings (resize, aspect, aspect fill).

AVCamDemo runs on iPhone OS 4.0 and later devices with a built-in video camera.

Packing List
------------
The sample contains the following items:

o Read Me.txt -- This file.
o AVCamDemo.xcodeproj -- An Xcode project for the sample.
o Classes.[h,m] -- The core AVCamDemo code.
o main.m -- Creates the app object and the application delegate and sets up the event cycle.
o Resources -- Contains the application nib files and image files
for the user interface.

Using the Sample
----------------
To test the sample, just run it and use the provided buttons to perform audio/video and still image capture. Here's a summary of the buttons:

o HUD -- capture configuration options as follows:

Flash - flash mode
Torch - torch mode
Focus - focus mode 
AExp - exposure mode
AWB - white balance mode

plus camera info:
Focus (adjusting focus)
Expose (adjusting exposure)
White Balance (adjusting white balance)

o Record -- start/stop recording
o Still -- capture a still image
o Grav -- change the video previews gravity setting

Recorded audio, video and still images are saved to the Photo library camera roll (except audio-only movies, which cannot be stored in the camera roll).

Building the Sample
-------------------
The sample was built using Xcode 3.2.3 on Mac OS X 10.6.3 with the Mac OS X 10.6 SDK.  You should be able to just open the project and choose Build from the Build menu.

How It Works
------------

AVCamDemo makes use of the following AVFoundation AVCapture classes to provide audio, video and still image capture and control:

AVCaptureAudioDataOutput
AVCaptureConnection
AVCaptureDevice
AVCaptureFileOutput
AVCaptureInput
AVCaptureMovieFileOutput
AVCaptureOutput
AVCaptureSession
AVCaptureStillImageOutput
AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer

See the AVFoundation documentation for more information.
