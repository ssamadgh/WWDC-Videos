/**
    `URLSessionTaskOperation` is an `Operation` that lifts an `NSURLSessionTask` 
    into an operation.

    Note that this operation does not participate in any of the delegate callbacks \
    of an `NSURLSession`, but instead uses Key-Value-Observing to know when the
    task has been completed. It also does not get notified about any errors that
    occurred during execution of the task.

    An example usage of `URLSessionTaskOperation` can be seen in the `DownloadEarthquakesOperation`.
