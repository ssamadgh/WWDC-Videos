aurioTouch

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

aurioTouch demonstrates use of the remote i/o audio unit for handling audio input and output. The application can display the input audio in one of the forms, a regular time domain waveform, a frequency domain waveform (computed by performing a fast fourier transform on the incoming signal), and a sonogram view (a view displaying the frequency content of a signal over time, with the color signaling relative power, the y axis being frequency and the x as time). Tap the sonogram button to switch to a sonogram view, tap anywhere on the screen to return to the oscilloscope. Tap the FFT button to perform and display the input data after an FFT transform. Pinch in the oscilloscope view to expand and contract the scale for the x axis.

The code in auriouTouch uses the remote i/o audio unit (AURemoteIO) for input and output of audio, and OpenGL for display of the input waveform. The application also uses Audio Session Services to manage route changes (as described in Core Audio Overview).

This application shows how to:

	* Set up the remote i/o audio unit for input and output.
	* Use OpenGL for graphical display of audio waveforms.
	* Use touch events such as tapping and pinching for user interaction
	* Use Audio Session Services to handle route changes and reconfigure the unit in response.
	* Use Audio Session Services to set an audio session category for concurrent input and output.
	* Use Audio Session Services to play simple alert sounds.
	
aurioTouch does not demonstrate how to handle interruptions.
