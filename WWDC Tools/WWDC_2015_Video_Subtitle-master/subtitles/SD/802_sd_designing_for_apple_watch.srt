00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:26,626
>> MIKE STERN: Hello, everyone.


2
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,036
My name is Mike Stern.


3
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,606
I'm the user experience
evangelist at Apple.


4
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,566
I'm really happy to be
with you today to talk


5
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:37,506
about designing for Apple Watch.


6
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:42,366
The Apple Watch is unlike
any device we have ever made.


7
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:46,886
It features all new ways to
select input and navigate


8
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:51,256
that are ideally suited to a
smaller device that's designed


9
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:52,706
to be worn on the wrist.


10
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,586
The Digital Crown affords
the ability to scroll, zoom,


11
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:01,316
and change values without
obscuring your view.


12
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:05,646
The Force Touch display
adds a new dimension


13
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,026
to the user interface.


14
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:10,996
Apple Watch's interface
is attuned


15
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:12,596
to the wearer's presence.


16
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:15,146
It wakes when you
raise your wrist


17
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:18,086
and it sleeps when you lower it.


18
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:23,816
Apple Watch blurs the boundaries
between software and hardware.


19
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:28,936
And the Taptic Engine creates
discrete, sophisticated


20
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:34,056
and nuanced experiences by
engaging more of your senses.


21
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:38,566
Apple Watch is ideally
suited for quick looks


22
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,146
and fast interactions.


23
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,306
The apps that you design


24
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:45,606
for Apple Watch should take
advantage of these things.


25
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:51,016
Your apps should complement
their companion iPhone app


26
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:55,106
by making information
and actions quicker


27
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:57,236
and more convenient to access.


28
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:02,606
Or they should extend the
functionality of your iPhone app


29
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:05,096
in ways that were
previously not possible.


30
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:11,516
Making really great Apple Watch
apps requires a different mind


31
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:15,636
set and approach than
designing for iOS or for Mac.


32
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:20,046
Which is why today I
would like to share


33
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:24,026
with you the three key
foundational design themes


34
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:28,826
of the Apple Watch, and the
apps that we made to run on it.


35
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:32,656
The first theme is about
personal communication.


36
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:36,046
Apple Watch is designed
to be worn.


37
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:40,466
No other other Apple
device has ever been


38
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,076
so closely connected
to the user.


39
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,386
Interactions on Apple Watch
create a more intimate


40
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:50,456
and personal experience
with technology.


41
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:55,206
The communication that occurs
between your app and the people


42
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:58,466
who use it should be just
as intimate and personal.


43
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:02,126
Now consider how we
communicate with each other.


44
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:05,026
When we are speaking with
someone, we try to get a sense


45
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,306
of what the other
person wants to know


46
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:09,006
and what they are
trying to tell us.


47
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:13,336
We try to use terms that
they'll understand and concepts


48
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:14,216
that they are familiar with.


49
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,946
When they look busy or
stressed out, we try to get


50
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,196
to the point more quickly.


51
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,036
Personal communication
requires us


52
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:24,726
to be attentive and empathetic.


53
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:28,976
Now, take that and apply it
to the design of your apps.


54
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,466
Probably one of the
most important aspects


55
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:36,136
of personal communication
is just being considerate


56
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:37,606
of people's time and attention.


57
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:40,006
We are all busy people.


58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,816
We live in a world filled
with constant distraction.


59
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:44,426
We often don't want


60
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:47,826
to be disturbed unless it
is something super urgent


61
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:50,106
or something we care
about deeply.


62
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:52,886
This is especially
true when it comes


63
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,036
to notifications on Apple Watch.


64
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,096
Apple Watch taps
a person's wrist


65
00:03:58,096 --> 00:03:59,716
when they receive
a notification.


66
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:03,476
This makes notifications
much more noticeable.


67
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,656
So carefully consider
how frequently you send


68
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:07,926
notifications to people.


69
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:11,726
They will get annoyed if you
send notifications too often.


70
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,776
Keep in mind that there's
no way for people to choose


71
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:19,916
which of your apps notifications
they'll receive on their watch.


72
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,646
They can only choose
whether or not they want


73
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,886
to receive notifications
from your app on their watch.


74
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:30,716
Avoid pestering them by frequent
interruptions throughout


75
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:31,246
the day.


76
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,906
Otherwise they will
pretty quickly wind


77
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,986
up turning off notifications
from your app on their watch


78
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,436
and maybe on their
iPhone as well.


79
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:42,656
Next, keep it relevant.


80
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:45,876
When we talk with someone,
we try to say things


81
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:46,836
that the other person is going


82
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,746
to find interesting
or informative.


83
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:52,046
Similarly the notifications
that you send


84
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:55,776
to people should contain
valuable and useful information.


85
00:04:56,576 --> 00:05:00,156
People should actually feel
thankful for the notifications


86
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,366
that you send to them.


87
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:04,766
Now, determining relevance
can sometimes be pretty


88
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:05,556
straight forward.


89
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,236
CNN sends notifications
about breaking news stories.


90
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:12,366
It's a reasonable assumption
on their part that people


91
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,966
who have downloaded their
app and installed it


92
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,566
on their watch want to know


93
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,966
about major news
stories as they unfold.


94
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:23,426
But for many apps or situations
this approach wouldn't work


95
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:23,946
so well.


96
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:28,476
Being relevant often requires
understanding context.


97
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,706
People's interests may
vary based on all sorts


98
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,136
of contextual factors.


99
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:35,486
By understanding that context,


100
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:39,286
you can prioritize certain
information or functions.


101
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,496
Now, the two main contextual
factors that are used


102
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:46,896
to determine relevancy
are location and time.


103
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,956
Let's take a look at how
location can be used.


104
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:54,866
Invoice2Go is an app
that enables people


105
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:57,176
to track the hours
that they work


106
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,246
and send invoices
to their clients.


107
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:02,176
For many of the people
who use their app,


108
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:03,956
time tracking is
based on location.


109
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:08,066
Billing starts when they
arrive at the job site,


110
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,096
and it ends when they leave.


111
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:14,766
Invoice2Go will optionally send
you a notification as a reminder


112
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:18,156
to start and stop time
tracking based on location.


113
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,136
By using your location,


114
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:23,616
Invoice2Go makes tracking
billable hours more convenient


115
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,736
and more accurate than trying


116
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:29,336
to remember how long you worked
hours or even days later.


117
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:33,696
Now as with location it is
important to find the right time


118
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,266
to communicate with someone.


119
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,866
Some information
is only relevant


120
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,556
at very specific moments.


121
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,766
So, for example, when
you are traveling


122
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,826
with American Airlines, their
app will send a reminder


123
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:47,136
when it's time for you
to leave for the airport.


124
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,766
This is very relevant
information.


125
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,336
No one wants to miss
their flight.


126
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,266
Now, another big aspect


127
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:57,526
of personal communication
is just paying attention.


128
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,746
People say this all
the time, right?


129
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:02,176
It is important for
you to pay attention.


130
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:03,696
Well, it is true.


131
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:05,166
Without paying attention,


132
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,916
you can never really know
what it is that people want.


133
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,566
So, for example, if
you're not sure what kind


134
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:13,026
of notifications people are
going to find most relevant,


135
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,796
just ask them to tell you.


136
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:18,266
Nike running and lots of
other apps have settings


137
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:19,626
to allow people determine


138
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:22,266
which notifications
they want to receive.


139
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,916
These kinds of settings are
what we might call explicit


140
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,126
user preferences.


141
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:32,286
They are very direct ways to
determine what is most important


142
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,026
to the people who use your app.


143
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,496
However, people don't
often explore app settings.


144
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,486
They can be difficult to find.


145
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:42,986
It takes an investment of
time to muck around with them.


146
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:44,526
People don't always
know what they do.


147
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:48,186
That's where implicit user
preferences will come in.


148
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,256
When you get to know someone,


149
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:52,636
you learn about their
tastes and their interests.


150
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,746
A lot of this you pick up just
by observing what it is they


151
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:57,666
like to talk about and do.


152
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:01,296
For instance, if you regularly
get coffee with a friend,


153
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,516
you probably know what kind
of coffee they like to drink


154
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:06,216
and how they like it prepared.


155
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,696
Because of that knowledge, you
can go and order them a drink,


156
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:12,726
and you would get just the
right thing that they wanted


157
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,676
without them having
to even tell you.


158
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,386
By observing and responding
to people's interactions


159
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:21,106
or behaviors, your
app can make subtle


160
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:22,916
but significant adjustments


161
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,526
to better accommodate
the preferences


162
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:26,726
of the people who use it.


163
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:30,796
The Fitness app is a great
demonstration of this concept.


164
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:33,905
Let's say I'm going
to go for a run.


165
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,176
I'm going to go work out
for the very first time.


166
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:39,206
I'm presented with a list of
different workout options.


167
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,145
I'm going to pick outdoor run.


168
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,866
On the next screen,
I'm given the choice


169
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,606
to select a goal for my run.


170
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:51,606
I can choose to have
a calorie goal


171
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,976
or duration goal
or a distance goal.


172
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,556
Now, when I work out, I don't


173
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:59,086
like to set very high
expectations for myself.


174
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,406
So I'm going to go with no goal.


175
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,936
Finally, I just tap
start and off I go.


176
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,066
Now, let's fast forward
a couple of days.


177
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,286
I'm going to go for
an outdoor run again


178
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,146
because I always run outside.


179
00:09:14,696 --> 00:09:16,086
When I launch the Fitness app,


180
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,716
outdoor run is the first
option in the list.


181
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:22,206
That list is being reordered
based on frequency of use.


182
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:26,476
And because it contains
information about my last run,


183
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:29,556
it is now physically taller,
so it's more prominent


184
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:32,546
and easier for me to tap.


185
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:37,436
On the next screen, the no goal
option is selected by default,


186
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,146
because that's the last
option that I chose.


187
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:43,946
It's unlikely for me
to change this setting.


188
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,446
By displaying it by
default, I don't have


189
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,006
to swipe past three screens
every single time I want


190
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,216
to go for a run.


191
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,836
By remembering basic
information about how I,


192
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:57,926
as an individual user,
like to work out,


193
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:01,506
Fitness is tailoring itself to
suit my individual preferences.


194
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:05,166
There's no configuration
that happens per se.


195
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:06,976
It just happens automatically.


196
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:10,476
It is a bit like having a
really good personal trainer.


197
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,106
A personal trainer
listens to you.


198
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:15,346
They understand what
your Fitness goals are


199
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,806
and remember the types


200
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:19,326
of exercises you do
when you work out.


201
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:24,366
Finally, when we are speaking
with someone who is really busy


202
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:28,196
or seems stressed out or kind
of distracted, we try to get


203
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:31,716
to the point more quickly
and drop irrelevant datails.


204
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:35,646
Interactions on Apple
Watch are very brief.


205
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:38,476
Your notifications, Glances


206
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:43,136
and apps should communicate the
most critical information only.


207
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:49,616
Okay. So let's move on to the
next big theme for the design


208
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:52,286
of Apple Watch and that
is Holistic Design.


209
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:56,386
Holistic Design is about
blurring the boundaries


210
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:58,276
between software and hardware.


211
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:03,496
The black color of the Watch
bezel was carefully chosen


212
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:05,716
to match the color
of the display.


213
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,966
This makes the border or
boundary between the display


214
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,746
and bezel practically
indistinguishable.


215
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,226
If you design your app to
have a black background,


216
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:19,026
the bezel will provide
visual padding


217
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,526
for your app's interface.


218
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:25,736
This allows you to go edge to
edge with content and controls


219
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:28,996
and allows your app
to seamlessly blend


220
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:30,896
into the watch itself.


221
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,606
Now, the second aspect of
Holistic Design that I would


222
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:37,446
like to talk about is
fully utilizing the Force


223
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:38,576
Touch display.


224
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:42,636
Firmly pressing the
display will show a menu


225
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:46,666
if your current screen has one
added to it in the story board.


226
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,626
The menu control is
one of the primary ways


227
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:52,226
that people interact
with Apple Watch apps.


228
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:54,796
It provides a number
of practical


229
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:57,316
and usability benefits
to your app.


230
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:02,726
First it frees up space
so that your UI can focus


231
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,226
on displaying information
and content.


232
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,646
There's very limited space
on Apple Watch display.


233
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:12,346
The menu gives you a way to
present controls without needing


234
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:15,626
to clutter your app's UI.


235
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:18,526
For example, in the stop
watch app, there's a bunch


236
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:21,986
of different styles to choose
from, but it would be hard


237
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:23,256
to show these in the main UI.


238
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:25,986
There just really
isn't enough space.


239
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:29,996
Perhaps these controls could
be added below and accessed


240
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:33,086
by scrolling, but with the stop
watch it is really important


241
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,256
that the time stays on screen at
all times in a fixed location.


242
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,236
Now, the menu plays
an instrumental role


243
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:43,466
in allowing apps like
Weather, Calendar and messages


244
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:47,486
and many other apps to focus
more on content and information.


245
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,746
Another huge benefit
of Menus is efficiency.


246
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:56,026
Menus make actions far
quicker for people to access.


247
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:59,046
For example, the
top level screen


248
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:02,046
in the messages app contains
a list of conversations.


249
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,756
The menu for the
screen has an action


250
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:06,466
to start a new conversation.


251
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,396
Now, if this action
wasn't in the menu,


252
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,856
it would probably be
displayed in line with all


253
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,016
of your conversations.


254
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:18,456
The trouble is, this could be
a really, really tall screen,


255
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,886
and what you are looking
at could be very far away


256
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:22,386
from where that action is.


257
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:27,306
And it would be hard
for people to remember


258
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,286
if that action was all the
way at the top of the screen


259
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:33,466
or all the way down by
the bottom of the screen.


260
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:36,406
Menus allow accessing actions


261
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,626
without losing your
current scroll position.


262
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:46,966
Now, Menus are also a great when
your app has a global control


263
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,776
that you want people to be
able to access from any screen.


264
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:53,406
So for example, in the
activity app, there's an action


265
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:55,136
for changing your
daily move goal.


266
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,576
This action is shown
in the menu no matter


267
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:58,786
where you are in the app.


268
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:02,416
The activity app is
structured as a page-based app.


269
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,456
If that control wasn't
in the menu,


270
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,546
it would perhaps
be in its own page.


271
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:10,676
But that would require four
swipes just to get to it


272
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:11,826
from the first screen.


273
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:13,936
By putting this action
in the menu,


274
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,566
you simply press
the screen no matter


275
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,326
where you are and there it is.


276
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:21,256
Another benefit of menus is
that they can avoid redundancy.


277
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,116
Let's go back to the
activity app for a second.


278
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,186
If we didn't put this
action into a menu


279
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:30,496
or on its own screen, we
could have multiple instances


280
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:32,166
of it on every page.


281
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,276
But that would be
pretty redundant.


282
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:37,696
Plus it could lead people
to be incorrectly assume


283
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:41,246
that that action had something
specifically to do with the page


284
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,956
that they were currently
looking at.


285
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:44,066
That would be wrong.


286
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:49,606
Okay. So I've gotten a lot
of questions about what kinds


287
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:51,376
of things people
should put into a menu.


288
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:54,756
Menus are primarily
for contextual actions.


289
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:58,056
That is actions that are
relevant to the current context.


290
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,596
Context here refers
to two things.


291
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:03,926
It could be the app or it
could be the current screen.


292
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,996
So activity is for
the app as a whole.


293
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:10,696
But in messages, as we saw
when you are looking at a list


294
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:14,186
of conversations, you have an
option to add a new message.


295
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:15,886
So when you are looking


296
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:18,576
at an individual
conversation, the menu changes.


297
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,646
A different set of actions are
appropriate for this context.


298
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:25,116
Making sure that the contents


299
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:29,716
of your menu are contextually
relevant to the app as a whole


300
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:31,706
or to the current screen
is really important.


301
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:36,416
People need to know what these
actions are going to act upon.


302
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:39,846
So in this case, it is clear
that these actions are going


303
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:42,596
to effect the current
conversation being viewed,


304
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,966
because that was what was
displayed before people pressed


305
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:45,676
the screen.


306
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,856
Another good use of menus is
for view mode preferences.


307
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,026
That menu with different
stop watch options is a view


308
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:55,006
mode preference.


309
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,926
Another example is
from the Calendar app.


310
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:01,016
There is a toggle for
switching between a list view


311
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:03,376
of your schedule or a
time proportionate view


312
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:04,016
of your schedule.


313
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:07,226
View mode preferences
are highly contextual


314
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:09,546
because they affect
the appearance


315
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:10,636
of the current screen.


316
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:14,596
It is worth mentioning
that menus are optional.


317
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:17,626
There is no need to have
a menu for a given screen


318
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:18,636
if there's no actions


319
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:20,286
or preferences that
are appropriate.


320
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:22,496
And some apps might
be simple enough


321
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:24,266
that they don't need
a menu at all.


322
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:31,866
Finally, it is not always
good to put actions in a menu.


323
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:36,256
Critical path actions, meaning
actions that are necessary


324
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:40,166
for the user to continue forward
in your app and complete a task,


325
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,026
should not be displayed
in a menu.


326
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,646
They should be presented
in line.


327
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:48,746
Displaying actions in line
makes them more discoverable.


328
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:51,176
So, for example,
in the Fitness app


329
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:54,506
when we've completed a work
out, you are given this choice


330
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:56,626
to either save or
discard the information


331
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,056
that was recorded
for your work out.


332
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,456
This is not an optional
decision.


333
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:03,546
You need to make the decision
one way or another in order


334
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:07,226
for you to progress
forward in the app.


335
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,736
In addition, if the
person's highly likely


336
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:11,536
to select a particular action,


337
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,736
then it should probably also
be shown in a main interface.


338
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:18,076
For example when you go
to listen to a voicemail


339
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:20,626
on the phone app, the chances
that you are going to want


340
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:24,935
to press that play button are
somewhere around 100 percent.


341
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:28,296
Right? Putting that action


342
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,036
in a menu would make it
needlessly inconvenient


343
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:32,386
for people to access.


344
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:36,246
And while calling the person
back who left the message


345
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:39,906
and deleting the voicemail are
definitely secondary actions,


346
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:42,866
there's still plenty of
space in this interface


347
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:45,536
to display those
controls without leading


348
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:48,326
to usability problems
or visual clutter.


349
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:52,776
The next aspect of Holistic
Design that I would like to talk


350
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,486
about is the Digital Crown.


351
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:59,606
The Digital Crown
enables fluid, responsive


352
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,036
and precise scrolling.


353
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:05,266
So when designing your app,
don't feel like you need


354
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,636
to make everything visible
on screen at one time.


355
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:10,256
It is just not necessary.


356
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,856
So the detail screen in the
Stocks app, for example,


357
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,666
contains a lot of information.


358
00:18:16,476 --> 00:18:18,746
Since there's no need to show
it all on screen at once,


359
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,516
the most important
information gets


360
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,746
to be displayed above the fold.


361
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,946
It's given a lot
room to breathe,


362
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,146
and we can see the
current values displayed


363
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:30,016
in much larger text, it's
a nice visual presentation.


364
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:32,976
The same is true for
apps like Weather


365
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:36,266
or Activity or many others.


366
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,946
Trying to show everything
on screen


367
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:41,516
at once is a sure fire recipe


368
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:45,276
for having a really cramped
looking interface with text


369
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:46,506
that is too hard to read.


370
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:51,716
In WatchOS2, the Digital Crown
becomes even more powerful.


371
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:54,916
There's a new WatchKit
control called the Picker


372
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,136
which I'm sure many of you
have already learned about.


373
00:18:57,986 --> 00:18:59,986
It gives you a lot of
great possibilities


374
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:02,096
for the design of your app.


375
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,776
Pickers come in three
different styles.


376
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:05,626
This is the stack style Picker.


377
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,346
It provides a way to navigate
and select from a list


378
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:09,996
of images or a set of images.


379
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:12,816
There's a list style
Picker which can be used


380
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:15,656
to select among an array
of text or numeric options,


381
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,426
and the sequence style Picker
which lets you pick an image


382
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,896
out of an image sequence
so you can do something


383
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:23,146
like this star rating.


384
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:26,776
And you can also use
a coordinated option


385
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:29,846
which allows you to display an
image sequence and pick an image


386
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:32,966
from the sequence to reinforce
the value of the Picker.


387
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,626
For example, when we
change the hour value here,


388
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:40,766
that orange arc is
being coordinated


389
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,746
and it reinforces the
value of the hour.


390
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:47,656
Now, the Picker allows values


391
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:50,706
to be displayed inline
and adjusted inline.


392
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,566
This is important because
it obviates the need


393
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,536
for having a completely
separate interface


394
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:57,786
for changing a selection.


395
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,246
As a result, it can
make interactions


396
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,626
with your Watch app
far more efficient,


397
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:07,936
and making selections inline
allows you to retain context.


398
00:20:08,536 --> 00:20:10,286
When we're adjusting
the data value,


399
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,516
it's nice that we can
see what the month


400
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:16,046
and year is at the same time.


401
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:20,516
When using a Picker,
there's a few options


402
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:21,506
that you should be aware of.


403
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:24,046
First, Pickers have outlines.


404
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:26,326
Outlines help people
to understand


405
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:30,006
that a Picker has focus,
meaning people understand


406
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:33,836
that when they rotate the
Digital Crown, the outline,


407
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:36,536
the value that is outlined
in green will be adjusted.


408
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:39,426
This is important when you
have two or more Pickers


409
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:41,466
that are displayed on
screen at the same time.


410
00:20:42,046 --> 00:20:45,346
In the example of the timer
app, the outlines let us know


411
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:47,516
that both hour and
minutes can be adjusted


412
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:52,506
and which one will respond to
rotations of the Digital Crown.


413
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:55,556
Outlines are not always needed.


414
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,686
So in this example, there
is no need for an outline


415
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:00,286
because there's only
one Picker on screen.


416
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:03,866
However, if this
screen were to scroll,


417
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:06,136
an outline would be
needed because people need


418
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:08,956
to know whether rotating the
Digital Crown will scroll the


419
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:10,886
screen or adjust
the Picker value.


420
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:13,676
You can also add a caption


421
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:16,576
if it's not clear what the
items in your Picker are.


422
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:19,466
For example, when you
are selecting different


423
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:21,466
complications, some
of these items aren't


424
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:22,956
totally self-explanatory.


425
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:25,926
They require a caption
to explain what they are.


426
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:31,186
Now, captions are set on a per
item basis, but if every item


427
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,796
in the Picker has the same
caption, it will serve


428
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,486
as a label for the
Picker itself.


429
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:39,886
Okay. The last setting
that you need to be aware


430
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:43,066
of is the contextual
indicator or scroll indicator.


431
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,926
It displays when the
Digital Crown is rotated.


432
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:48,346
The contextual indicator
is useful


433
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:51,686
for helping people understand
about how many options they have


434
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,436
to choose from and where
they are in that list.


435
00:21:54,856 --> 00:22:00,226
Now, the last aspect of
Holistic Design that I would


436
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:03,416
like to discuss with you today
involves the Taptic Engine.


437
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:09,196
And in WatchOS2 two
your apps will be able


438
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,766
to create haptic
feedback as many


439
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,296
of our built-in apps do today.


440
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:16,766
Each haptic pattern
is complemented


441
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:18,526
by a very brief audio tone.


442
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:23,756
By using the sense of touch and
sound to provide user feedback


443
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,936
in addition to the visual cues
that people see on the screen,


444
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:30,656
Apple Watch apps can
create a deeply immersive


445
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:32,136
user experience.


446
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:35,896
There are nine different
types of haptic feedback


447
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:37,876
for you to choose from.


448
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:41,006
I'd like through each one with
you and show you an example


449
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,156
of how they should be used.


450
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:45,436
When I prepared this
presentation,


451
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:48,656
I realized it's hard to
talk about haptic feedback


452
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:50,136
when you guys won't be able


453
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,056
to experience how
these things feel.


454
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:58,126
So I got a little bit of
budget allocated, and I had all


455
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,116
of your chairs rigged
with 14 super high powered


456
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:02,346
Taptic Engines.


457
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:04,496
I hope you guys are
ready for this.


458
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:06,356
Just kidding.


459
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:10,306
That's why I would like
to show you a diagram


460
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,866
of how each haptic pattern
and audio wave form work


461
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,226
in conjunction with each other.


462
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:19,276
So, for example, this is
the notification haptic.


463
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:22,276
The magenta shape
represents points in time


464
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,936
where the Taptic
Engine would be active


465
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,216
and the wave form obviously
represents the audio tone.


466
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:30,926
Let's hear how notification
sounds.


467
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:33,566
[Sound]


468
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:36,076
This haptic plays when
you receive a push


469
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:37,296
for local notification.


470
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:39,966
Now you can use this
in your app as well.


471
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:42,016
Let's look at it in context.


472
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:47,276
[Tone]


473
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:50,906
The notification haptic,
and audio tone is good


474
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:53,986
for alerting people when
something significant or out


475
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:57,386
of the ordinary has occurred
and requires their attention.


476
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:02,066
The direction up and
direction down haptic is useful


477
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:02,926
for alerting people


478
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:05,746
when a really significant
value has crossed


479
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:08,706
above some significant
threshold or crossed below it.


480
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:10,306
Let's hear how that sounds.


481
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:12,656
[Tone] That's up.


482
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:17,446
And down. [Tone] Let's
see that in context.


483
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:23,906
[Tone, tone, tone.


484
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:28,796
Tone, tone, tone]


485
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:33,726
The success haptic provides a
confirmation tone to indicate


486
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:35,846
that an action has
completed successfully.


487
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:39,896
[Tone] That has a nice
ring to it, right?


488
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,146
Very positive.


489
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:43,016
In context.


490
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:48,446
[Tone] So this tone
is really good


491
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:50,566
for providing people
positive feedback


492
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,346
like they are taking a quiz
and they got an answer right


493
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:55,436
or playing a game and
they completed a level.


494
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:59,376
Here is the failure
haptic, the arch nemesis


495
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:00,436
of the success haptic.


496
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,396
Hear how that sounds.


497
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,376
[Tone] The failure
haptic indicates


498
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:08,076
that an action failed
to perform.


499
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:14,866
[Tone] That's discouraging,
pretty negative.


500
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:17,766
Generally you wouldn't
want to fail on someone


501
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,706
and not give people
options for a try.


502
00:25:20,106 --> 00:25:22,566
It's better to do
something like this.


503
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:26,536
[Tone] And see that in context.


504
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:34,306
[Tone] This tone is
a bit more forgiving.


505
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:37,526
It tells people, "Hey, it
didn't work out very well,


506
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:38,876
but okay, no big deal.


507
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,856
You can totally try again.


508
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,206
" There are also tones for
starting an activity [Tone.],


509
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:47,476
and stopping an activity.


510
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,116
[Tone, tone] Here
they are in context.


511
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:57,846
[Tone, pause, tone, tone] As
the illustration suggests,


512
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:02,156
these are good for timers or
your Watch starts playback


513
00:26:02,156 --> 00:26:05,886
or recording on a
companion iOS app.


514
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:08,606
Finally there's a special


515
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,646
and subtle haptic
called a click haptic.


516
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:14,966
This one as I said
is a bit special.


517
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,786
As you can see it's far
more quiet and brief


518
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,956
than others we just looked at.


519
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:22,526
In fact I wasn't sure everyone
would be able to hear it,


520
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:28,116
so I artificially normalized its
audio level so it is much more


521
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,636
like the others but in
reality it's a bit more quiet.


522
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:36,516
[Click] Let's hear that again.


523
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:37,916
[Click] Very quick, right?


524
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:42,386
This haptic provides the
sensation of a dial clicking


525
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:45,986
at predefined increments
or intervals.


526
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:50,776
[Clicking sound] This haptic is
good for things like this dial.


527
00:26:56,256 --> 00:26:58,686
[Clicking sound]
Now, if you notice,


528
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,676
this dial has minor tick
marks and major tick marks.


529
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:05,026
I only played this click
sound at the major tick marks


530
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,836
because you don't want
every little tick mark


531
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:08,936
to cause this click.


532
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:10,266
It would be too much.


533
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:15,106
Even playing at the major
tick marks could be too much.


534
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,476
The thing is, about haptics,


535
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:19,276
they can't overlap
with each other.


536
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:22,106
So let me play an illustration
of what we just saw.


537
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,896
[Clicking]


538
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,496
You can see here there's plenty
of space in between these clicks


539
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,536
for them to individually play


540
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:34,456
without them stomping
on each other.


541
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:38,036
But if we were adjusting this
volume with the Digital Crown,


542
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:39,986
that's fine if we're
rotating slowlily.


543
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,396
What if we did a quick
twist and it went


544
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:43,866
through those values
very quickly.


545
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,826
It would look more like this.


546
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,906
Now, the thing is,
this can't happen.


547
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:52,906
The Taptic Engine will
prevent these haptics


548
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:54,616
from playing simultaneously.


549
00:27:55,756 --> 00:28:01,246
Instead it will play
the ones that it can.


550
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:04,166
Now, this would result
in people hearing


551
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,586
and feeling less feedback
when they go quickly


552
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,086
than if they had gone slowly.


553
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:12,196
[Clicking noise]: We
only heard two cliques


554
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,106
when before we heard five.


555
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:15,796
That would lead to confusion


556
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:19,106
about how much the
value had been adjusted.


557
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:21,586
With this haptic,
use it judiciously.


558
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:23,886
Exercise restraint.


559
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:29,176
Just remember that haptics
can't play simultaneously.


560
00:28:29,176 --> 00:28:31,886
For all haptics this
is good advice.


561
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:35,976
You should use them sparingly
to draw people's attention


562
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:38,616
to truly important
events in your app.


563
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:41,386
Their effectiveness
will diminish greatly


564
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,266
if everything a person does in
their app causes their watch


565
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:47,056
to vibrate and make sounds.


566
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,346
And please use these
haptic tones and patterns


567
00:28:52,346 --> 00:28:54,586
as they were intended
to be used.


568
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:58,276
If haptic and auditory
feedback isn't used consistently


569
00:28:58,276 --> 00:29:01,226
across all of the apps that
we make, they are going


570
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:02,156
to lose their meaning.


571
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:03,676
We are all in this together.


572
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:06,206
We need to use these as they
are supposed to be used.


573
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:11,076
Okay. So quick recap
about Holistic Design.


574
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:14,156
Holistic Design is about
blurring the physical boundaries


575
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:17,896
between software and
hardware, getting your UI


576
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:22,066
to match the bezel color and
utilizing the Digital Crown


577
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:24,896
and the Force Touch display
and the Taptic Engine


578
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:28,506
to create a seamless connection
between software and hardware.


579
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:33,526
Okay. So let's move on to
the last major design theme


580
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:36,776
for Apple Watch and that
is lightweight interaction.


581
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,836
Lightweight interaction
means taking advantage


582
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:42,796
of the Watch's unique
position on the user's wrist


583
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,806
by offering them quick
and convenient access


584
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,386
to information and actions.


585
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:51,256
Interaction times in Apple
Watch are far more brief


586
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,996
than on an iPad or iPhone.


587
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:58,526
Interaction times on those
devices could be in the minutes


588
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:01,336
or even hours, whereas
interaction times


589
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:03,416
in Apple Watch are just
a matter of seconds.


590
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:07,816
Our internal metric for
interaction times is


591
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:10,316
about five seconds or less.


592
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,726
Checking your schedule,
going for a run,


593
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:17,036
replying to a text shouldn't
take longer than this.


594
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:22,106
You need to seriously consider
this when designing your app.


595
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,656
Designing for such
short interaction times


596
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:26,996
requires focus.


597
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:31,036
It requires focusing on the
most essential information


598
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:33,716
and actions and presenting
them as clearly


599
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:35,376
and legibly as possible.


600
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:39,356
You may need to drop
features if it takes too long


601
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:41,326
for people to accomplish tasks.


602
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:43,926
With that in mind, let's
look at how the concept


603
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:47,636
of lightweight can influence
how you design Glances,


604
00:30:47,676 --> 00:30:49,176
Notifications and apps.


605
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:51,266
Let's start with Glances.


606
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:54,606
The name says it all,
it speaks volumes.


607
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:58,396
Glances are scannable
summaries of the information


608
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:00,426
that people seek
out most frequently


609
00:31:00,806 --> 00:31:02,106
from their favorite apps.


610
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:06,226
Your Glance may only be seen
on screen for a brief moment


611
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:08,956
in time as people swipe
from one Glance to another.


612
00:31:09,596 --> 00:31:12,896
So focus on showing only the
most essential information


613
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,306
from your app and display
it as clearly as possible.


614
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,796
The purpose of the Weather
Glance is very clear.


615
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:22,516
Show people the current
weather conditions


616
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:23,716
in their current location.


617
00:31:24,456 --> 00:31:27,666
This information is timely and
it's contextually relevant,


618
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,256
and it is the information
that people seek


619
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,566
out most frequently
from the Weather app.


620
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:36,176
Usually it's the only thing
that they want to know.


621
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,566
If they want to know
more like the forecast,


622
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:41,656
tapping the glance
will deep link


623
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:44,236
to an appropriate detail
screen within the app.


624
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:48,046
So even though the Glance
only shows a little bit


625
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:51,986
of information, more information
is just one tap away.


626
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:56,096
Try to strike a similar
balance with your Glance.


627
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,726
Display the most
frequently sought


628
00:31:58,726 --> 00:32:01,006
after information from your app.


629
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:05,506
Show information that is timely
and contextually relevant.


630
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:09,276
And make it easy for people
to get more information


631
00:32:09,376 --> 00:32:10,316
by deep linking


632
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:13,536
to an appropriate
screen within your app.


633
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:16,666
And in addition, it is important
to communicate as clearly


634
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,116
and as efficiently as possible.


635
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:20,956
Even if you are only
showing just a few key pieces


636
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,786
of information, some of that
data might be more important


637
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:24,496
than the rest.


638
00:32:24,716 --> 00:32:27,596
In the Weather Glance,
we immediately focus


639
00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:30,616
on the current temperature
because it's so much larger


640
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,766
and brighter than the
rest of the information.


641
00:32:33,396 --> 00:32:35,906
When there's just a few
elements on the screen,


642
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:38,366
there's more space for you
to do something like that


643
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:42,636
to draw people's attention to
one really key piece of data.


644
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:46,376
Graphics are also
a really good way


645
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:48,466
to communicate clearly
and efficiently.


646
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:50,806
The icon here makes it clear


647
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:52,956
that it is partly
cloudy outside.


648
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:57,056
Animations and graphs
are also great


649
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:59,686
for communicating
efficiently in your Glance.


650
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:02,706
It is also usually a good idea


651
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:04,986
to left align content
in your Glance.


652
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:08,686
Left aligned text for
most languages, at least,


653
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:12,046
tends to be more scannable
and it looks more orderly,


654
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,386
and it will help your
Glance to feel right at home


655
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,116
in the overall Glance UI.


656
00:33:18,676 --> 00:33:21,516
Now when you start to design
your Glances, it is important


657
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:23,736
to know that Glances are
constructed from templates.


658
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,016
Glances are made by
combining one upper template


659
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:30,316
and one lower template.


660
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,156
This is a modular system.


661
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:37,176
There are 12 upper templates
and 24 lower templates


662
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:38,236
for you to choose from.


663
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:41,506
To make your Glance, you
just pick one of each.


664
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:45,306
Now, Glance templates
partially determine the size


665
00:33:45,366 --> 00:33:48,156
and appearance of text,
which helps to ensure


666
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:49,626
that they are highly legible.


667
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:53,826
And Glance are also designed to
follow a consistent layout grid.


668
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:55,976
This helps to provide an element


669
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,046
of consistency across
all Glances.


670
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:02,046
Without this structure, the
overall Glance UI would start


671
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:05,156
to feel really cobbled together,
and that wouldn't be very great.


672
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:08,326
Enough about Glances.


673
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:10,275
Let's move on to notifications.


674
00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:14,946
Notifications are a key aspect
of many Apple Watch experiences.


675
00:34:15,726 --> 00:34:18,456
Notifications are all about
lightweight interaction.


676
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,476
The purpose of a notification is


677
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:24,666
to communicate high value
information clearly,


678
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:26,126
quickly and succinctly.


679
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:30,516
In order to accomplish this,
you want to use as few words


680
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:34,766
as possible and avoid
any unnecessary details.


681
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:38,246
Now even though the height
of a notification can scale


682
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:41,065
to accommodate its contents,
people don't want to read a lot


683
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:42,806
of text on their Apple Watch.


684
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:44,806
Get to the point quickly.


685
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:48,936
The notification that Calendar
sends when a meeting has started


686
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:50,886
and maybe you're running
a little bit late,


687
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:52,926
that's a good example of this.


688
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:56,536
There is no unnecessary
information or fluffy language.


689
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:59,456
Thirty-three minutes
ago, which meeting?


690
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:03,236
Today. 4:30 to 5:30.


691
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:09,756
Not this. As with Glances, if
people want to know more detail,


692
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:12,856
your notification
can offer a deep link


693
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:15,466
into an appropriate
screen in your app.


694
00:35:16,696 --> 00:35:18,956
Now, most notifications
contain only text.


695
00:35:19,356 --> 00:35:20,046
And that's great.


696
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:23,066
But in some cases
you can use graphics


697
00:35:23,106 --> 00:35:24,446
to communicate more quickly.


698
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,076
Like this notification
from the fitness


699
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,946
and diet tracker app Life Sum.


700
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,566
They use graphics for many of
the notifications they send.


701
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:36,146
Obviously this one is a
reminder to drink water.


702
00:35:37,276 --> 00:35:38,236
But the real power


703
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,256
of notifications isn't
just how they inform people


704
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:42,856
about the things that matter.


705
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:46,266
They are also a convenient
way for people to take action.


706
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:49,646
By seeing actions
presented in a notification,


707
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:52,336
people know that it's
possible to take action


708
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:55,196
and they know what their
choices for acting are.


709
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:59,866
Interactive notifications
are really about triage.


710
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,886
You should think
about it in this way.


711
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,276
People receive timely
or urgent information


712
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:07,256
and they can take
immediate action.


713
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,526
Only display the most
relevant action or actions.


714
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,936
So, for example, the new message
notification gives you just one


715
00:36:15,936 --> 00:36:17,406
option, to reply.


716
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:20,416
Now, other actions could
have been presented here,


717
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,826
but this is hands-down
the most likely choice


718
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,316
that anyone would want to make.


719
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:28,376
Okay. Enough about
notifications.


720
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:31,816
Let's turn to how you can
support lightweight interaction


721
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,016
in your apps.


722
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,776
Apps and games in Apple
Watch should be far simpler


723
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:39,676
than the typical
iPhone app or game.


724
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:45,266
You must always remember Apple
Watch is not a miniature iPhone.


725
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:49,756
I have seen countless developers
trying to take the entirety


726
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:54,106
of their iPhone app experience
and cram it into a Watch app.


727
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,116
That is a recipe for disaster.


728
00:36:57,536 --> 00:37:01,426
It leads to overly complicated
apps that are difficult


729
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:03,906
or impossible to
use and navigate.


730
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:07,846
To be totally clear, making
an Apple Watch app to be


731
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:10,046
like your iPhone
app is a non-goal.


732
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,576
The goal instead should be
to design an Apple Watch app


733
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:16,896
that complements
your iPhone app.


734
00:37:17,466 --> 00:37:21,326
This may involve hand picking
just one or two key functions


735
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:23,356
and bringing it over
to Apple Watch.


736
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:27,296
Or it could be creating an
entirely different experience


737
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:28,726
for Apple Watch.


738
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:32,056
Whatever you do, focus
on the essentials.


739
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:35,666
Don't present too much
information or functionality.


740
00:37:36,406 --> 00:37:39,576
Only include the things
that people truly want quick


741
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:41,096
and convenient access to.


742
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,736
Let's look at a couple
of examples.


743
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:48,526
Green Kitchen on iOS is an
awesome cooking app with lots


744
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:51,266
of delicious recipes,
ingredient lists


745
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:52,796
and step-by-step instructions.


746
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:57,676
Technically they could have
done all of this on Apple Watch,


747
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:01,106
but they took a different
approach and focused


748
00:38:01,106 --> 00:38:03,706
on something simple
which is timers.


749
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,866
While you are cooking with one
of their recipes, you'll notice


750
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:09,826
that the times are highlighted
in green, and if you tap one


751
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:13,346
of those times, it will start
a timer which you can monitor


752
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:18,306
on your iPhone but also
monitor it on your Apple Watch.


753
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:21,806
Their Apple Watch app is
a quick and convenient way


754
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:24,456
to see how much time is
left in the current step.


755
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:26,326
Of course you can choose


756
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:29,616
to receive notifications
when the timer is up.


757
00:38:30,546 --> 00:38:33,276
Let's look at the
New York Times app.


758
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:38,036
Now, on the iPhone they have
tons and tons of content.


759
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:40,656
You can access all
of their editorials


760
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:41,956
and articles and more.


761
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:46,426
Again, doing this on Apple
Watch is technically possible,


762
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:49,316
but it would be a
terrible, terrible idea.


763
00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:50,006
Don't do that.


764
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,276
Just browsing through the list


765
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,936
of sections alone would
take way too long.


766
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,106
No one in their right mind wants


767
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:59,256
to read a thousand word
article on their wrist.


768
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:02,206
Instead the New York Times app


769
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:06,226
for Apple Watch only shows
a curated set of top stories


770
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:10,396
that their editorial team
has hand crafted just


771
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:11,406
for the Apple Watch.


772
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,856
They only show what they
believe are the most important


773
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:16,396
and timely news stories.


774
00:39:17,246 --> 00:39:20,296
Each story is really
just a quick synopsis.


775
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:23,246
It is not, they are not
displaying full articles.


776
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:27,116
Reading the full story
would take way more


777
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:29,466
than two to five seconds.


778
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:33,976
If people want to continue
reading, there's a save


779
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:37,056
for later action in the menu
so they can bookmark a story


780
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:38,856
and read it later on
the iPhone or iPad.


781
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:42,536
Or they can take
out their iPhone


782
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:44,216
and continue reading more.


783
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:46,546
It's natural behavior.


784
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:51,236
That is why it's so important
to implement hand-off.


785
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:54,896
When the New York Times reader
transitions from the Watch


786
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:57,256
to their iPhone, they may notice


787
00:39:57,256 --> 00:40:00,106
on their lock screen the
New York Times app icon.


788
00:40:00,936 --> 00:40:03,616
Swiping that up will take
them directly to the story


789
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:05,716
that they are reading
on the AppleWatch.


790
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:10,436
Hand off makes it easy for
the New York Times reader


791
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:13,676
to move seamlessly from
their Watch to their iPhone


792
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:14,696
when they want to know more.


793
00:40:15,556 --> 00:40:18,136
This benefits the New York
Times reader, of course,


794
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:20,716
but also benefits
the New York Times


795
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:23,886
because it keeps people
engaged with their experience,


796
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:26,366
their apps for a
longer period of time.


797
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:29,706
Hand-off is relatively new.


798
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:33,406
You may feel the need to
educate your users about it.


799
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:36,016
As a matter of fact, the
New York Times does this.


800
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:39,746
In the first launch onboarding
experience they show a tip


801
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,146
about how it works.


802
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:45,206
Otherwise, they just rely upon
people naturally discovering


803
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:47,946
this function on their own.


804
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,066
Now, other apps take
a different approach.


805
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:50,826
This is CNN.


806
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:53,346
Soon they will be
taking advantage


807
00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:55,696
of the video play back
capabilities of the Apple Watch


808
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:59,926
to provide short video
clips from their content.


809
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,506
Now, they are going to
also provide a little bit


810
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,216
of instruction that
says people can continue


811
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:08,526
to watch the full
video on their iPhone.


812
00:41:09,246 --> 00:41:11,336
That is really good
information to have


813
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:13,136
because without it
you wouldn't know


814
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:15,276
that there's a longer
version of the video.


815
00:41:15,826 --> 00:41:17,236
This is useful information.


816
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:21,606
CNN also shows this little
monochromatic version


817
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:24,546
of their iOS icon which
is a pretty clever trick


818
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,466
for priming people to spot it


819
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:29,946
when they go over
to their iPhone.


820
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:33,756
Both CNN and the New York
Times provide good examples


821
00:41:34,106 --> 00:41:36,696
of how you can communicate that
your app supports hand off.


822
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:41,856
However, over time this may
become less necessary as more


823
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:43,956
and more people will
expect that all


824
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:46,016
of your apps will
support hand-off.


825
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:49,596
It's up to you to decide
what's right for your app.


826
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:52,386
If you are concerned that people
won't realize there's more


827
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:55,176
information or functionality
which is available


828
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:58,226
on your iPhone app, by
all means, let them know.


829
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:00,406
That's helpful to your users.


830
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:04,186
Otherwise, just let people
discover it on their own.


831
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:06,596
Now, that said, there's
one thing


832
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:09,616
which is almost never required
when it comes to hand-off.


833
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,076
That is showing a
butt-in for hand-off.


834
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:16,696
Only in rare circumstances is
it ever necessary for people


835
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:18,046
to tap a button in order


836
00:42:18,046 --> 00:42:20,036
to continue an activity
on their iPhone.


837
00:42:20,476 --> 00:42:22,656
Hand-off should happen
automatically.


838
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:26,456
Now, there's one more aspect
of lightweight interaction


839
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:28,126
that I would like
to discuss with you.


840
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:32,746
It relates to health
apps and relates to --


841
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:35,366
when you are using
HealthKit to track a work out.


842
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:39,816
More specifically it's
about creating sessions


843
00:42:39,816 --> 00:42:41,226
to keep your app
in the foreground


844
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:44,326
when you are tracking an
activity like going for a run.


845
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:47,886
Ordinarily when Apple
Watch has been sleeping


846
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:52,326
for ar short period of time, it
assumes that the user is done


847
00:42:52,326 --> 00:42:54,466
with doing whatever
they were doing before,


848
00:42:54,956 --> 00:42:57,436
no longer interested in
the app, and it will resume


849
00:42:57,506 --> 00:43:00,236
to the clock face, not
the previously used app.


850
00:43:01,276 --> 00:43:03,256
But this changes when
an app is being used


851
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:05,656
to track an activity
like going for a run.


852
00:43:06,846 --> 00:43:09,396
While that person is
running, they want to stay


853
00:43:09,396 --> 00:43:10,766
in the activity tracker app,


854
00:43:11,406 --> 00:43:13,426
raising the wrist
should allow them


855
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:16,576
to quickly check their
progress, which is why


856
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:20,656
in WatchOS 2 activity
tracker apps will remain


857
00:43:20,656 --> 00:43:23,016
in the foreground while the
HealthKit workout session


858
00:43:23,016 --> 00:43:23,626
is ongoing.


859
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:28,496
Implemented correctly, sessions
enable lightweight interaction


860
00:43:28,496 --> 00:43:30,266
because simply by
raising your wrist,


861
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,996
you return to the app
you're most interested in.


862
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:36,256
People don't need to
continually navigate back


863
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:37,586
to the app from the home screen.


864
00:43:38,446 --> 00:43:40,856
If you intend to
adopt this feature,


865
00:43:40,856 --> 00:43:43,896
there are a few key
things you should consider


866
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:44,666
and keep in mind.


867
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:49,396
First and foremost, the person
using your app must always be


868
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:50,056
in control.


869
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:54,916
They must deliberately and
knowingly start a workout.


870
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,666
They must always understand
how to end a workout.


871
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:02,086
And when they look at the
app, it is a really good idea


872
00:44:02,086 --> 00:44:04,276
that they understand that
a session is ongoing.


873
00:44:04,936 --> 00:44:07,536
Your app's UI should
be obviously different.


874
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:09,296
It should be clear to
people that they are


875
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:10,916
in a special modal state.


876
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:14,886
The Fitness app provides a good
example for you to reference.


877
00:44:15,716 --> 00:44:17,646
To start a workout
in the Fitness app,


878
00:44:17,646 --> 00:44:19,066
the user taps the start button.


879
00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:21,556
The button literally says start.


880
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:22,336
It's clear.


881
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:25,556
After tapping the start button,
there's a three-second count


882
00:44:25,556 --> 00:44:27,626
down that a session
is about to begin.


883
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:31,106
Ending a work out is
equally straight forward.


884
00:44:31,386 --> 00:44:32,856
You just swipe to the first page


885
00:44:32,856 --> 00:44:34,656
and tap the clearly
marked end button.


886
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:38,576
This is a consequence.


887
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,646
This is why I don't
set high expectations


888
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:41,906
for myself when I go for a run.


889
00:44:42,456 --> 00:44:47,686
As a convenience, there's a
second end button in the menu,


890
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,566
but it's a good idea to not
rely upon people knowing


891
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:54,026
that your app has a menu in
order for them to end a session.


892
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:56,956
While the workout is ongoing,


893
00:44:57,066 --> 00:44:59,756
the Fitness app UI is
clearly in a different state.


894
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:02,546
It is obvious, the
UI makes it obvious


895
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:03,846
that it is recording a work out.


896
00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:07,456
Sessions are about convenience.


897
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:09,116
They are not about
keeping people


898
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:10,546
in your app against their will.


899
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:14,856
If the session started
without the user's knowledge


900
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:16,856
or it's difficult for them
to figure out how to end it


901
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,936
or it is not clear
that one is ongoing,


902
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:21,566
they will likely feel
stuck in your app


903
00:45:21,566 --> 00:45:23,526
and that is not a
great experience.


904
00:45:24,826 --> 00:45:28,016
So let's take stock.


905
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:30,536
I think that was a lot of stuff.


906
00:45:30,536 --> 00:45:31,196
I want to review.


907
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:35,036
Personal communication is
about applying what we know


908
00:45:35,036 --> 00:45:38,366
about thoughtful and effective
interpersonal communication


909
00:45:38,706 --> 00:45:40,476
to the design of your apps.


910
00:45:40,896 --> 00:45:43,986
It is about being respectful
of people's time and attention


911
00:45:44,356 --> 00:45:46,906
by being concise,
relevant and responsive


912
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:49,916
to the person's individual
preferences.


913
00:45:50,696 --> 00:45:52,906
Holistic Design is about
blurring the boundaries


914
00:45:52,906 --> 00:45:54,746
between software and hardware


915
00:45:55,096 --> 00:45:57,946
by making your app's UI
practically indistinguishable


916
00:45:58,306 --> 00:45:59,276
from the Watch bezel.


917
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:03,356
Utilizing the Force Touch
display to enable quick access


918
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:06,156
for contextual actions
or preferences.


919
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:09,836
Knowing that scrolling is
easy so there's no need


920
00:46:09,896 --> 00:46:13,536
for cramped UIs, and using
the new Picker to enable quick


921
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:16,316
and accurate selections
in context.


922
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:19,786
And using haptic feedback
to create sophisticated


923
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:24,206
and more deeply life like
experiences in your app.


924
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:27,436
And lightweight interaction
is about offering people quick


925
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,936
and convenient access to
information and actions.


926
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:35,116
Now, these three themes
should be the foundation upon


927
00:46:35,116 --> 00:46:38,246
which you design
your Apple Watch app.


928
00:46:41,056 --> 00:46:42,356
But there's something
missing here.


929
00:46:42,356 --> 00:46:45,426
There is something that
these three themes don't


930
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:46,536
adequately capture.


931
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:49,806
That is the role of
beauty and delight.


932
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:55,306
Apps that are beautiful and
delight us make our experience


933
00:46:55,306 --> 00:46:57,256
with technology more
interesting,


934
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:00,066
more welcoming and more fun.


935
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:03,586
Even though the Apple
Watch display is small,


936
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:06,596
there is still plenty of
space to make it beautiful.


937
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:09,596
Even though interaction
times are meant to be brief,


938
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:11,796
there's still plenty
of time to delight.


939
00:47:12,576 --> 00:47:16,076
I would like to share with
you three of my favorite apps


940
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:19,096
that are really exemplars
of this concept.


941
00:47:20,516 --> 00:47:23,136
Resound makes Bluetooth
enabled hearing aids


942
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:25,616
that could be controlled
by your Apple Watch.


943
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,626
This is a natural
fit for Apple Watch


944
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:32,176
because it is now really
convenient to discretely check


945
00:47:32,176 --> 00:47:34,596
and adjust the settings
of your hearing aid.


946
00:47:35,306 --> 00:47:39,506
There are various preset options
that you can choose from.


947
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:42,646
You can modify those with
fine grained controls


948
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:46,046
for noise reduction,
speech attenuation


949
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:47,716
and wind cancellation.


950
00:47:48,586 --> 00:47:51,706
Now each of these settings
is beautifully expressed


951
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:52,746
with animation.


952
00:47:53,616 --> 00:47:55,376
They could have just
used sliders, right?


953
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:59,246
But these animations are
gorgeous, and they do way more


954
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:02,286
to help people understand
what each setting does


955
00:48:02,506 --> 00:48:05,126
and what the current value is.


956
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,606
Now, Pace Maker is
an awesome DJ app


957
00:48:08,906 --> 00:48:10,516
that just won an
Apple design award,


958
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:14,036
and one of the reasons
why we awarded them is


959
00:48:14,036 --> 00:48:17,126
because of their excellent
Apple Watch design concept.


960
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:20,986
Pace Maker turns your
watch into a remote.


961
00:48:20,986 --> 00:48:25,836
It allows you to mix and pick
tracks when your iPhone is not


962
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:27,686
on you and docked
with your speaker.


963
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:32,196
Now, one thing that is really
cool is you can apply effects


964
00:48:32,636 --> 00:48:33,806
while a song is playing.


965
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,756
In a second I'll
show you what happens


966
00:48:36,756 --> 00:48:38,146
when you apply an effect.


967
00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:42,356
I would like you to pay
attention to these animations


968
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:44,146
that they made for
these buttons.


969
00:48:45,516 --> 00:49:18,616
[Music]


970
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:19,926
One more time.


971
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:26,986
[Electronic music]


972
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:29,056
How cool is that?


973
00:49:29,476 --> 00:49:29,826
Right?


974
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:31,296
[Applause]


975
00:49:31,296 --> 00:49:32,736
Yeah, give it up for Pace Maker.


976
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,566
It is amazing.


977
00:49:37,176 --> 00:49:39,336
Now, they could have just
highlighted those buttons


978
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,436
or drawn an outline around
them when they were active,


979
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:43,216
but they didn't do that.


980
00:49:43,716 --> 00:49:46,136
They changed the
size, the shape.


981
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,116
They had them sync
up with the music.


982
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:51,326
I mean it's super creative.


983
00:49:51,896 --> 00:49:54,596
It's meaningful, and it is
synched up to the music.


984
00:49:55,336 --> 00:49:55,956
Really cool.


985
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:58,416
And finally, this is Toby.


986
00:49:59,276 --> 00:50:01,146
Now, in Apple Watch
you can feed Toby.


987
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:05,616
When he's bored you
can play with Toby.


988
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:12,006
When he's tired you can
ask Toby to take a nap.


989
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:15,776
Good night, little guy.


990
00:50:15,816 --> 00:50:19,316
You can even take Toby
for a walk when he needs


991
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,766
to go to the bathroom.


992
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:24,836
Each of these animations
is adorable.


993
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:27,446
They are these great
little moments.


994
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:30,366
Look at the way he's peeking
off from the side of the watch.


995
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:32,566
So engaging.


996
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:33,926
It's so charming.


997
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:37,046
But check this out.


998
00:50:37,046 --> 00:50:40,926
Now, Toby can't be
on both your iPhone


999
00:50:41,346 --> 00:50:42,696
and the Watch at the same time.


1000
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:45,166
It is not physically
possible for a dog to be


1001
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:48,036
in both places at once.


1002
00:50:48,036 --> 00:50:53,426
So in order to call Toby over to
your Watch you just Force Touch


1003
00:50:53,456 --> 00:50:58,176
press the display, use the
action, say, "Here, Toby."


1004
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:03,696
Isn't that amazing?


1005
00:51:08,446 --> 00:51:09,236
I just love that.


1006
00:51:10,596 --> 00:51:11,576
So creative.


1007
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:14,166
These apps demonstrate


1008
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:18,286
that creative ideas thoughtfully
executed with great attention


1009
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:22,006
to detail result in some
really fantastic experiences


1010
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:22,886
for Apple Watch.


1011
00:51:23,616 --> 00:51:26,336
All three look fantastic
and do things


1012
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,576
that are original
and unexpected.


1013
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:31,816
And all three use
animation to great effect.


1014
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:35,316
Which brings me to the last
thing I want to talk with you


1015
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:38,796
about -- talk to you about
today and that is animation.


1016
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:42,716
In watchOS 2 making great
animations just got a


1017
00:51:42,716 --> 00:51:43,606
lot easier.


1018
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:47,276
Basic layout and appearance
properties are now animatable


1019
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:47,776
at runtime.


1020
00:51:48,696 --> 00:51:50,006
You can animate properties,


1021
00:51:50,046 --> 00:51:53,306
like it controls its
height or its width.


1022
00:51:54,566 --> 00:51:55,896
You can adjust insets.


1023
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:59,126
You can change alignments.


1024
00:52:00,976 --> 00:52:02,366
Background colors.


1025
00:52:03,696 --> 00:52:04,526
Tint colors.


1026
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:07,966
And of course opacity.


1027
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:12,786
Now, all of these
animations have easing applied


1028
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:16,366
so the transitions between
different states are smooth


1029
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,066
and natural.


1030
00:52:18,046 --> 00:52:21,226
By combining animations you
can do some pretty cool things.


1031
00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:24,166
For instance, you can
create animated bar charts


1032
00:52:24,966 --> 00:52:27,626
or smoothly animate
between different data sets.


1033
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,006
You can recreate the number
animation from the activity app.


1034
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:35,656
Or better yet, you
can combine this


1035
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,246
with an image sequence
animation.


1036
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:40,666
There are really
countless possibilities


1037
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:42,186
for you to explore.


1038
00:52:43,516 --> 00:52:47,076
But as with haptics,
exercise restraint.


1039
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:50,986
Animations on Apple Watch
should, of course, be quick.


1040
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:53,876
They should never feel like they
are slowing you down or getting


1041
00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:56,316
in your way especially
on your Watch.


1042
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:58,536
They should be these
little moments


1043
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:01,606
that make your app more
informative and delightful.


1044
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,336
Okay. So that's about
all the time I have.


1045
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:09,006
For more information, these are
really great sessions I want you


1046
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:09,626
to know about.


1047
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,816
If you're an engineer, you
definitely want to check


1048
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:14,616
out WatchKIt tips and tricks,


1049
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:16,536
happens this Friday
in this room.


1050
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:19,006
If you want to know
more about animation,


1051
00:53:19,006 --> 00:53:20,356
we have a whole session devoted


1052
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:22,876
to the topic called
Designing with Animation.


1053
00:53:23,816 --> 00:53:27,216
Next, as in not next because
it was a couple hours ago,


1054
00:53:27,216 --> 00:53:29,736
but we had a great
presentation called Designing


1055
00:53:29,736 --> 00:53:30,526
for Future Hardware.


1056
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:33,466
That's a fascinating look at
how you design for a device


1057
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:34,796
that doesn't yet exist.


1058
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,326
The video will be online
shortly, of course.


1059
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:42,086
If you're into typography like
I am, you really do not want


1060
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:46,346
to miss this session which
happens Friday here in Presidio.


1061
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:49,476
It is one of the people
that designed San Francisco,


1062
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,666
the new system font for
all of our platforms.


1063
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:55,356
He goes into great detail about
the design of the typeface.


1064
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:59,556
Finally, if you are not sick
of hearing my voice already,


1065
00:53:59,556 --> 00:54:02,856
we are going to be doing a
second entirely different talk


1066
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:05,806
about designing for Apple
Watch that happens just


1067
00:54:05,806 --> 00:54:07,836
after the type session.


1068
00:54:08,906 --> 00:54:10,846
And in the meantime I
encourage you to check


1069
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:13,326
out the recently
redesigned Apple Watch human


1070
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:14,356
interface guidelines.


1071
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:16,716
It contains a lot
of information,


1072
00:54:17,106 --> 00:54:19,106
downloadable templates
and guidelines


1073
00:54:19,106 --> 00:54:21,466
that will help you jump
start the design process


1074
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:22,636
for Apple Watch.


1075
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:26,426
For further questions or to show
me the awesome apps you made


1076
00:54:26,426 --> 00:54:29,296
for Apple Watch or
any other platform,


1077
00:54:29,596 --> 00:54:31,036
feel free to shoot me an e-mail.


1078
00:54:31,306 --> 00:54:32,566
Thank you so much for your time.


1079
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:32,976
It has been an honor.


1080
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:35,508
[Applause]
