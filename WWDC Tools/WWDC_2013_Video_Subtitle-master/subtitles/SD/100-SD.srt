Those words mean a great

12
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:13,566
that reflected throughout
the show today.

00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:17,536
Welcome to the Worldwide
Developers Conference.


14
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:19,876
You're going to have
incredible week.


15
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:23,756
This is our 24th WWDC.


16
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,766
It's the longest running
developer conference


17
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:27,666
that we're aware of.


18
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:29,566
It's truly worldwide.

00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:33,036
We have attendees this
morning for over 60 countries


20
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,116
and two-thirds of the people


21
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:38,126

No hazing from the

24
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,276
We've got a great week planned
for you with over 100 sessions


25
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:55,446
and over 120 hands-on labs so
you can bring in your code,


26
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:58,216
get some help tuning
it or get just


27
00:02:58,216 --> 00:02:59,776
about any question answered.


28
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:03,286
We also have over 1,000
engineers here this week,


29
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,256
so grab them, make use of
them, they're here to help.


30
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,406
But don't ask them
about future roadmaps.


31
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:13,796
Now, the Developer Program
is incredibly vibrant.


32
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:18,686
We have over six million
registered developers with one


33
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:21,766
and a half million of those
added in the last year alone.


34

Demand for this show
has never been greater.

I'm really sorry we couldn't
accommodate everyone.


38
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,296
This is the biggest
venue that we can get.


39
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:43,816
But we are posting
sessions online everyday


40
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:46,296
so that developers can
follow us remotely.


41
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,666
I'd like to get started
this morning


42
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:52,436
with the few updates
beginning with Apple retail.


43
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,616
Of course, our retail stores
are the best place to discover


44
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,196
and explore our products,


45
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:03,306
and over a million people
per day did that last year.


46
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:04,626
It's phenomenal.


47
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:08,976
Our stores are filled with
our colleagues who work


48
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,856
at our stores because
they're passionate


49
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:14,696
about how Apple technology
can enrich people's lives.


50
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,896
Our stores had become
integral parts


51
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,586
of the communities
that they serve.


52
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,376
Tens of thousands of school kids
pick their local Apple Store


53
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,136
as the destination for
their annual field trip.


54
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,536
And millions of customers
come to our stores


55
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,486
for personal training so that
they can learn to get the most


56
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,756
out of their Apple products.


57
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,086
We now have 407 stores
around the world.


58
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,506
We're operating in 14 countries.


59
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:46,776
And we've recently opened this
beautiful store in Berlin.


60
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:49,416
It is really awesome.


61
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,876
It's in a 100 year old building.


62
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:57,206
It was originally one of the
first theaters in Berlin.


63
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:01,176
We've painstakingly honored
the history of the building


64
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:05,216
by restoring the facade
and the original theater,


65
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,736
and added some classic
Apple touches along the way.


66
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:13,336
The theater is integral to
the building but separate


67
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,226
from the store, and we'll be
hosting many events throughout


68
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:20,666
the year for the communities
from music to films and more.


69
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:24,166
We had our signature
crowds at the opening.


70
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:28,036
And we were so excited about
this opening, we made a video


71
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:30,956
and I'd like to run it
for you this morning.

It's a fantastic store
in a great location.


76
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,226
Only Apple could do this.


77
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:15,516
Now we also have some
pretty great digital stores.


78
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,936
And I know this is
incredibly important to those


79

of you in the audience.

The App Store celebrates
its 5th birthday next month.

Nothing like the App
Store existed before

changed the world.

incredible apps.

50 billion apps.

a truly staggering number

Thanks to you, we now have
900,000 apps in the store

90 percent of those are
downloaded each month.


92
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:05,276
We have 375,000 apps that
have been designed for iPad

to take advantage of the
full beautiful canvas

to just a few hundred

96
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:18,786
And we have 575 million
accounts.


97
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:22,396
These are-- most of these
accounts have credit cards


98

credit cards than any store

we're aware of.

this morning to announce


103
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:45,706

And the momentum is incredible.


106

We paid out five billion of
that just in the last year.


107
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:05,266
Now to put that in context,
that's three times more


108
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:09,566
than all other platforms
combined.

[ Applause ]


110
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:21,546
One of the things we love
about the App Store is


111
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,486
that it levels the playing field


112
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:27,336

and small developers.

144
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:10,866
Now, we're going to
start by sharing some


145
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:11,896
of the technology
under the hood.


146
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:14,596
As we have these cars go
through a few formations,


147
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,556
realize that each of them is
completely driving themselves


148
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:20,746
and our app is coordinating
the entire experience


149
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,846
over Bluetooth Low Energy.


150
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:25,036
The cars can control their speed
and they steer on the track


151
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:27,746
by doing the same computations
your brain does when you drive.


152
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,376
They sense where they're
located and they react


153
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:32,626
to their surroundings
all in real time.


154
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,606
This red car, he's
our hero, Aidan.


155
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:39,546
We designed him and
all the other cars


156
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:40,776
to be incredibly smart.


157
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,496
Five hundred times per
second, they're running logic


158
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,896
to sense a track, their position
on it, adjusting their steering


159
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,936
and speed and communicating
back and forth


160
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,216
with our AI engine
on that iPhone.


161
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:53,496
I'll let Aidan join his friends
and tell him to hit the gas.


162
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:54,706
Watch this.


163
00:11:58,206 --> 00:11:58,716
There we go.


164
00:11:59,326 --> 00:11:59,816
All right.


165
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:05,356
So, as Aiden weaves
through the pack,


166
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:08,026
our app knows everything
that's happening in real time.


167
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,676
It's analyzing thousands


168
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,946
of potential actions
every single second.


169
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:14,416
And not just for Aiden
but for every single car.


170
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,846
We are using iOS devices
not just as remote controls


171
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:21,386
but as the brains behind an
immersive real world experience.


172
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:24,226
And that is what lets this
bring these cars to life.


173
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,646
Now let's do something
interesting here.

Brad. He's going to
tell these other cars


175
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,296
to try to block Aiden.


176
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:32,816
And just to be clear, none
of this is choreographed.


177
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,436
All we're doing is defining
a new objective for each car


178
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,776
and they'd figure out the rest.


179
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,016
Here, Aiden, he's using the
exact same logic he was using


180
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:43,616
before, sensing where he is
and reacting to the other cars


181
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:44,606
as he looks for an opening.


182
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,896
Expect now, these other guys are


183
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:50,746
on a mission to try
to block him.


184
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:50,976

00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:20,436
This is a video game
in the real world.


192
00:13:20,436 --> 00:13:22,226
We can customize
everything in software


193
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,786
from the characteristics
of the vehicles


194
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,006
to the weapons that
they can use.


195
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:28,096
We are taking all of the things
that we love about video games


196
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:29,276
and programming them


197
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,106
on to physical characters
you can actually touch.


198
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:34,486
With Anki Drive, we
use this technology


199
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:36,136
to take gaming to
a whole new level.


200
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,246
And the real fun starts
when you take control


201
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,256
of these cars yourselves.


202
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:42,206
With your iPhone or

00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:59,066
And we just pushed the
Anki Drive app today

00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,156
so you can download it
and get a deeper look.

I think these guys are going
to be super successful.


220
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:27,456
I think it's a great example
of the power of the combination


221
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:32,016
of your incredible apps and the
iOS devices in the ecosystem.


222
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:35,186
I'd love to show you a lot more
today but we don't have time.


223
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,086
But I'd like to thank--
on behalf of Apple,


224
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,176
I'd like to thank all
of the developers here


225
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,896
for making such incredible apps.

00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:43,496

228
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,866
Next, I'd like to
talk about the Mac.


229
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,996
The Mac install base now is
incredibly strong at 72 million.


230
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:04,096
This is double what it
was just five years ago.


231
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:08,476
We announced the new iMac at
the end of last year and it went


232
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:11,166
on to become the number
one desktop in the US.


233
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:16,066
And the MacBook has
continued to define the future


234
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,516
of the notebook and is the
number one notebook in the US.


235
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:24,006
In fact, the Mac business
has outpaced the PC business


236
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,646
for several years now.


237
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,106
And if you look at
the last five years,


238
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:32,136
the average annual growth
rate isn't even close.


239
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:35,946
And if you look at the total
growth over that period of time,


240
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,116
the Mac is at a 100 percent


241
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:43,766
versus the PC a paltry,
18 percent.

243
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:53,486
Now for us, it's never
been about making the most.


244
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,536
We care much more that
the Mac is number one


245
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,826
in customer sat and quality.


246
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,076
And you don't just have
to take my word for it.


247
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:05,236
All of these guys agree.


248
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:10,956
Now, we have lots of innovation
for the Mac last year and one


249
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:14,196
of those was announced
here with Mountain Lion.


250
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:18,046
Mountain Lion of course is
our latest release of OS X.


251
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,316
We shipped 28 million copies


252
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:25,226
since we announced it making
it the best selling release


253
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:25,656
of all time.


254
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:30,266
And what's even more
impressive is that 35 percent


255
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:34,376
of our users are using the
latest version of using--


256
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:36,056
are using Mountain Lion.


257
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:39,746
Now, that compares to
Windows 8 which is kind


258
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,866
of struggling to get to five.


259
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:47,916
We're making the best
Macs we've ever made


260
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,796
but we're not standing still.


261
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:54,276
We've got lots of
innovation left.


262
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,936
And today, we want
to talk to you


263
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:59,026
about what we're
doing with OS X.


264
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:03,136
To do that, I'd like to invite
Craig Federighi up to the stage.


265
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:03,916
Craig.

00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:14,806
You guys are too kind.


269
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,336
Good morning, let's
talk about OS X.


270
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:21,336
Our latest release,
Mountain Lion, is the ninth


271
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:25,336
of our big cat-named releases
in just over a decade.


272
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:29,016
As we turn our attention
now toward the 10th,


273
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:30,736
we've hit a real issue.


274
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:37,346
We do not want to be the
first software in history


275
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:42,536
to be delayed due to a
dwindling supply of cats.


276
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:47,876
Now, fortunately, we do have
a creative group at Apple


277
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:49,456
and we can think out of the box.


278
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,926
And so, we thought, may be
we could take this lion thing


279
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:53,936
in a different direction.


280
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:57,926
So, I'm proud to present
to you today OS X Sea Lion.


281
00:17:57,966 --> 00:18:00,086
What do you think?

283
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:10,006
OK, may be not.


284
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,196
That could be a bit
of a dead-end, so.


285
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:16,106
In fact, we're really excited
about the future of the Mac


286
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:17,856
and we want a set of names
that are going to carry us


287
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,966
for at least the next 10 years.


288
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:23,506
And, you know, the answer really
was really obviously to us.


289
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:28,876
It's those places that
inspire us here in California,


290
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:32,566
in the place where OS X
is designed and built.

292
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,236
So for our first
California-themed release,


293
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:45,586
it went just outside our
backyard, just off the coast,


294
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,746
to a place with some
of the biggest waves


295
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,726
and most extreme surfing in all

298
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,926
Now, Mavericks is a release
with deep technology focused

on extending battery life
and providing responsiveness.


300
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:16,076
It has great new apps and
enhancements for every Mac user,


301
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,366
and some features that
we think are going


302
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,386
to really appeal
to our power users.


303
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,066
And I want to talk
about just three


304
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,516
of them right now
starting with Finder Tabs.


305
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:31,036
[ Applause ]


306
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,126
Sounds like you guys you know
how this is going to work.


307
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,696
So, you of course can
work in the Finder


308
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:37,716
with multiple windows.


309
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,146
It's a very powerful tool.


310
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:42,406
But now you can draw all those
windows together in tabs.


311
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:46,616
And each tab can have its own
location, its own view mode.


312
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:47,766
It's a really powerful tool.


313
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,636
You can actually drag
contents and hover across tabs.


314
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,126
And of course, now that we
have Tabs in the Finder,


315
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:56,066
it's also a great app
to take full screen.


316
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,386
Next, Tagging.


317
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:00,336
>> Yes.


318
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:01,426
>> Yes.


319
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:07,776
That guy. We're bringing
tagging to the Mac.


320
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:10,346
So now, when you
save a document,


321
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:12,906
in addition to providing
its location


322
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,676
and name, you can tag it.


323
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,786
And when you do, it will appear
right in the Finder sidebar.


324
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:21,486
And in fact, you can tag
things wherever they are,


325
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,906
whether they're in iCloud
or on a local file share,


326
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:27,906
and all those will be brought
together and appear in Finder.


327
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:32,936
And, tags are great for really
powerful search as well.


328
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,336
Next-- yeah.


329
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:37,716
Next, Multiple Displays.


330
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:38,206
Really, all right.


331
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:48,426
The Mac-- of course, we're not
giving you all the free multiple


332
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:49,036
display here.


333
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:50,636
This is software.


334
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:54,796
So, with multiple
displays in the Mac,


335
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,186
it's always been a powerful
way to spread out your work.


336
00:20:57,186 --> 00:21:01,146
But now, in Mavericks,
you can get at your menus


337
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,956
across multiple displays.


338
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:06,686
You can summon your DOC
across multiple displays.


339
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,156
And when you take a window
full screen on one display,


340
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,156
it doesn't mess with your
desktop on the other display.


341
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:18,836
[ Applause ]


342
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:20,276
And I really love this.


343
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:23,246
When you pan your spaces,
you can do it independently


344
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,576
on each of your displays.

[ Applause ]


346
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:33,526
Finally, if you have an
AirPlay-connected HDTV,


347
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:37,736
it acts as a full power
separate display as well and I'd


348
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:39,626
like to show all of
these to you now.


349
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:44,776
[ Applause ]


350
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,996
All right, let's take our
first look here at Mavericks


351
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:50,236
and we're going to
start with the Finder.


352
00:21:51,856 --> 00:21:54,626
So, here's Finder environment,
I got a lot going on,


353
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:56,846
a lot of windows, a lot
of different locations.


354
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,856
I'm going to go up
here to the Window Menu


355
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:00,316
and let's merge all my windows.


356
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:03,966
Just like that, they
hop into a set of tabs.


357
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:07,936
Now, of course, these tabs
at different locations,


358
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,686
different view settings for
each to those locations.


359
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,466
Creating a tab is
just as you'd expect.


360
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:14,486
Just click Plus.


361
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:18,056
I can select another location
like AirDrop, may be another


362
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:20,306
for this Work File Share.


363
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,426
I'm going right here.


364
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:25,446
And now that I have multiple
tabs, it's a really great way


365
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:27,136
to actually work
and copy documents.


366
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:29,346
If I want to copy this field
report, I can just hover


367
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:34,366
over the AirDrop tab, drop it
just like that, really nice.


368
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:40,526
And, of course, I can now
take Finder full screen.


369
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:43,776
Next, let's take
a look at tagging.


370
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:44,906
This is really cool.


371
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:46,716
So as I go to save a document,


372
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,136
you know as I can give it a name
like, let's say, Project Plan.


373
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,486
And in addition to its
location, in this case,


374
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:55,036
I'm going to save it in
iCloud, I can also give it a tag


375
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:56,326
from any of the tags
I've made up.


376
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:59,066
So I'm going to call
this document Important.


377
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:00,296
Looks pretty important to me.


378
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:04,196
And we'll go here into
the Finder and you see


379
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,676
in the Finder sidebar,
I have an Important tag


380
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,026
and I see all these documents.


381
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,216
They're from different
locations,


382
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:12,596
different applications, all
drawn together in sidebar.


383
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,046
We have other tags.


384
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:16,836
I've given things for things
that are draft and in review.


385
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:18,146
Now, of course with tags,


386
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,666
I can assign multiple
tags to the same document.


387
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,936
That's part of the
power of tags.


388
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:25,256
So I go here and I'm going to
say this one is also in review.


389
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:27,966
And you notice, as I sign
that tag, it now appears


390
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,336
in that location as well.


391
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:33,046
And if I want to assign a
totally new tag, I want to make


392
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,506
up a tag on the fly, you
can just type it right here.


393
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,256
This is a website
project I'm working on.


394
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:39,026
It's says Create
New Tag Website.


395
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:42,106
And just like that,
I've created a new tag


396
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,846
and you can see it right
here in the Finder.


397
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:47,716
I can give that tag
a color of course.


398
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:51,606
And now that I have that
tag, I can also assign tags


399
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:54,836
by just dragging things in
to the Tagger and the Finder.


400
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:58,526
So different assets from my
website, just drag them in


401
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:00,076
and they're tagged like that.


402
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:02,806
And tags are great
for searching.


403
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,486
So if I start typing,
let's say, Important,


404
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,126
it can find all documents
that are important.


405
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,476
Let's go to All My Files,
we'll find all documents,


406
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:14,416
they're both important
and that are in review.


407
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:18,506
Just like that, I found exactly
what I'm looking for with tags.


408
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:24,826
[ Applause ]


409
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:27,476
Next, let's take a look
at Multiple Displays.


410
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:29,676
I'm going to open up some
other kind of windows


411
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,136
that I'm often working with.


412
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,086
We'll open iPhoto here, may
be a keynote presentation.


413
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:37,426
And I actually have a
second display connected


414
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:38,446
to this MacBook Pro.


415
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,726
Let's show that up
there on display now.


416
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,576
Of course with multiple
displays,


417
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:46,456
I can just move windows across
displays like you'd expect.


418
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:50,306
But now, I can get up at my
Menu bar in the second display.


419
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,646
If I go down to the bottom,


420
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:54,136
I can summon the
DOC just like that.


421
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,226
If I want to open an app on the
second display, I can just open


422
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:59,826
that on the DOC here
and here is iTunes.


423
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:03,436
Take this app full
screen just like that.


424
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:06,876
And as I swipe spaces,
just right back there.


425
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:09,836
Just on that display, let's take
a keynote full screen as well.


426
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:13,236
I'm going to go back to
my first display here.


427
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:15,956
Let's even take iPhoto
full screen.


428
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,546
So now, I have different
full screen apps


429
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,696
on my different displays.


430
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:20,316
This is actually really
fantastic way to work.


431
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:23,996
Go in here into Favorite Travels
and I can now drag assets


432
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:27,896
across my full screen apps
like that, super cool.


433
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,996
And, Mission Control has
just been super charged


434
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:31,916
for multiple displays.


435
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,586
So, I'm going to go now
into Mission Control


436
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,626
and we see my different
full screen spaces


437

and desktops across
applications.


438
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,266
I can drag a window from
one display to another.


439
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:47,156
I can also go and drag
a full screen app right


440
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:50,266
across displays, bring
Preview open, and now I have


441
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,376
that full screen on
this display as well.

Finally, I actually have
an Apple TV around here.


444
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:03,486
Let's bring that into place.


445
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:05,196
So here's my Apple TV.


446
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:08,046
Now, this is pretty
over the top.


447
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:11,816
So I can actually go
here into AirPlay.


448
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:13,856
I'm going to connect
to this Apple TV.


449
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:18,856
So now, it's a full
power display as well.


450
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:21,616
You can see I have my
Menu bar and my DOC.


451
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,096
I can go over here
and get my DOC here.


452
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:28,806
And, I can go into
Mission Control, even,


453
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:33,046
and I can go get a window
across that other display.


454
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:35,886
We'll just drag Keynote
over here,


455
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:40,186
right on to my Apple
TV, and open it up.


456
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:42,916
There it is, full
displays in Mavericks.

[ Applause ]


458
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:50,826
Next, I'd like to talk


459
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:54,406
about some advanced
technologies in Mavericks.


460
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:58,476
You know, our power users are
increasingly doing their work


461
00:26:58,476 --> 00:26:59,276
on the go.


462
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,726
They want great responsiveness


463
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:03,226
but they also want
great battery life.


464
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,626
And in Mavericks, we've
introduced a whole host


465
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,146
of technologies to
address that challenge.


466
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,086
Things like Compressed Memory


467
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:13,716
that make sure you have
memory available very quickly


468
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:14,816
when apps demand it.


469
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:16,766
Technologies like App Nap


470
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:19,436
that actually makes sure
we're directing power only


471
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:20,456
to those applications


472
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,086
where you're really
benefiting from it.


473
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,656
System-wide Core Animation
Accelerated Scrolling


474
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:28,936
and OpenGL 4 for super
responsive graphics.


475
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:30,966
And, a topic I want to go


476
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,966
into in a bit more detail
now, Timer Coalescing.


477
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:38,446
So you know, when you look at
battery life on your computer,


478
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,316
the real factor that software
has the most influence


479
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:44,596
over is CPU activity
and its draw on power.


480
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,736
And if you look at what
your system is doing


481
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:50,466
at any given time, what
you'll see as you look


482
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,876
under the hood is not a smooth
line, but actually hundreds


483
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:56,396
of interrupts occurring per
second where the system is going


484
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:59,366
from a power-efficient
sleep state up to a state


485
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:01,446
of high power use and back down.


486
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:05,326
And all of those transitions
actually consume a lot of power.


487
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:09,396
Well in Mavericks, we
intelligently align all


488
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,076
of that work, reducing those
numbers of transitions.


489
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:15,506
This, in combination with
technologies like App Nap


490
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:20,476
and other power optimizations,
reduce CPU utilization activity


491
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:23,666
for these kinds of
scenarios up to 72 percent.


492
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:24,976
It's pretty awesome.


493
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:31,666
[ Applause ]


494
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,076
Next, let's talk about
Compressed Memory.


495
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:37,256
Nothing affects the
performance of your Mac,


496
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:39,406
the responsiveness more of
a Mac, that's under load


497
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,466
than its ability to provide
free memory to an app.


498
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,146
Now, typically, when you
look at your app runtime,


499
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:46,836
all your memory is inactive.


500
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,726
In fact, a subset of your
memory is actively being used


501
00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:52,156
and others is memory
we have to keep around


502
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:53,806
but isn't being used by the app.


503
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:57,956
Well, now if you open a
document, your system is going


504
00:28:57,956 --> 00:29:00,926
to need to get free memory
and it does that in the past


505
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:03,866
by writing those inactive
bits of memory out to disk,


506
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,106
and that's a slow process.


507
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:07,956
Now, with Compressed Memory,


508
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:11,526
we're able to rapidly compress
the inactive memory making free


509
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:13,786
space available almost
instantaneously


510
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:14,636
to the application.


511
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,856
This can have great
effects on responsiveness


512
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:18,876
of systems under load.


513
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:21,886
You see, 1.4X kinds
of improvements,


514
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,596
even on fast SSD
systems for activities


515
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:27,616
like opening new documents
or reactivate an application,


516
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:32,086
and up to 1.5X improvement for
waking a system from standby,


517
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:36,386
these are just two of
many improvements to power


518
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:38,106
and performance in Mavericks.


519
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:40,716
Next, let's talk about Safari.


520
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:46,816
In the last decade of life,
Safari is focused not just


521
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,336
on providing the easiest to use


522
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,226
and most elegant
browsing experience,


523
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,486
but also the most innovative.


524
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:55,616
These are the kinds
of innovations


525
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:58,236
that Safari has brought,
private browsing,


526
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:00,896
blocking of third party
cookies for privacy,


527
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:03,656
making the web easier to read
with features like Reading List,


528
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:08,186
and the HTML5 audio and
video tag, all Safari-firsts.


529
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:10,326
And the engine in
Safari, WebKit,


530
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:14,246
is used by over 1.5
billion devices.


531
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:18,456
Well in Mountain Lion, we're
making Safari even better.


532
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:22,236
We have a great clean new
homepage with top sites.


533
00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:27,066
From there, you can get at great
sidebar where you have access


534
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:29,916
to all of your bookmarks
and you can browse right


535
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:30,856
from your bookmarks.


536
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:34,726
And in that sidebar, we
also have Reading List


537
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,216
where now you can
continuously scroll


538
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:39,776
through your articles moving
from article to article


539
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:40,886
without ever having to click.


540
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:46,556
And a great new feature called
Shared Links where you see all


541
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,566
of the links shared by
people you're following


542
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:49,806
on Twitter and LinkedIn.


543
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:51,196
You can browse them right here.


544
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:55,966
Now in addition to these
end-user improvements,


545
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:59,776
there's also a lot going on
under the hood, big improvements


546
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,286
to JavaScript, a full
process-per-tab architecture,


547
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:05,066
and memory efficiency
improvements


548
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,396
with the shared memory resource
cache, and a whole bunch


549
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:10,476
of big power savings as well.


550
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:11,846
When you look at the effects


551
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,466
of these changes,
it's pretty profound.


552
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,906
If you take a synthetic
benchmark like SunSpider,


553
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:20,276
you see how Safari fairs
against the competition.


554
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,576
But, you know, researchers
have started to look


555
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:26,626
at more real world JavaScript
by sampling the JavaScript


556
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,876
that actually occurs on sites


557
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:31,226
like the Google homepage,
Facebook, Amazon.com.


558
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:33,996
And when you look at Safari's
performance on a benchmark


559
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:38,196
like that, JSBench, the
results are really incredible.


560
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:45,196
[ Applause ]


561
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:49,376
Safari is also awesome when
it comes now to memory usage,


562
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:51,856
using way less memory
than the other browsers


563
00:31:51,856 --> 00:31:54,456
which means more memory for
you to browse with more tabs


564
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,766
and do more on your system.


565
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:59,536
And when it comes to energy
use, it's not even closed.


566
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:03,026
Safari uses way less
energy than Chrome.


567
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:05,986
And when you compare to
Firefox, it's just kind of sad.


568
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,296
So that's Safari.


569
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,546
I'd love to give
you a demo of some


570
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,756
of our advanced technologies
in Safari right now.


571
00:32:19,246 --> 00:32:21,966
So, let's start with
responsiveness


572
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,106
and I'm going to
go now into mail.


573
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:28,466
And so here, we have a mailbox
with about 100,000 messages


574
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:33,306
in your inbox and I just want
to show you how you scroll now


575
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:34,566
with that accelerated scrolling.


576
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:37,846
Perfectly smooth,
incredibly fast,


577
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,936
almost 60 frames a
second whenever you do it,


578
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:41,986
it's just epic.


579
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:44,976
And when you look
here at scrolling


580
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:47,416
through a conversation,
this is a conversation


581
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:48,936
with 26 messages in it.


582
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:54,216
Again, just super glassy
smooth, super fast,


583
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:55,696
it's really, really nice.


584
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:57,726
Let's take a look
at that in Safari.


585
00:32:58,096 --> 00:33:00,466
In Safari, we've
improved scrolling


586
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:04,086
for more popular websites and
actually optimized heavily


587
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:08,946
for retina displays so now, it's
just super fast, super smooth.


588
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:10,956
Now, let's take a look at power.


589
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,286
Yeah, there's a fan of
smooth scrolling right there


590
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:13,736
in the front.


591
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,296
I'm a fan of smooth
scrolling as well.


592
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:21,046
So let's take a look at power
use, so you have a power meter


593
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:23,196
up here that's showing
CPU activity in Safari


594
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:25,306
and you notice right
now, it's quite low


595
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:26,726
because we're not
doing anything.


596
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:30,356
But let's go into a website
that's going to use a lot


597
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,626
of power and you notice
the power meter shoot right


598
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:35,646
up because we're doing a lot of
animation here using all the CPU


599
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,286
and that's OK, that's
what the CPUs for,


600
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,846
it's doing something
cool for me right here.


601
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:41,286
But very often, you'll have
something like this happening


602
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,996
in an add off in the corner,
you've covered this window up


603
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:46,206
and yet, it's still
draining your battery life,


604
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:47,366
you don't even realized it.


605
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:51,586
Well now, with this technology
we call AppNap, we keep track


606
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:54,116
of what's going on and what
things you actually to see


607
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:55,726
to decide where to direct power.


608
00:33:56,186 --> 00:33:59,886
So watch what happens when I
bring up this iTunes window


609
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:02,326
over the Safari window,
the power drops right down


610
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:10,766
and that's extending
your battery life.


611
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:16,396
But of course, that
thing is still running,


612
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:19,726
it's still available to me so if
I pull it aside, there it goes,


613
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,386
you can see everything
happening right now.


614
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:25,196
The power goes up, cover back
up, power goes right back down,


615
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:30,795
it's really going to
help your battery life.


616
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:35,346
Next, let's take a look at
the new Safari top sites.


617
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:37,856
Really clean, really nice.


618
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,246
We'll bring out the new sidebar.


619
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:40,946
You see I have all
my bookmarks here.


620
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:43,456
I have my bookmark
folders as well.


621
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,366
If I want to bring a side
over for my bookmarks


622
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:48,576
in the top sites, I can
just drag it out like this.


623
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,525
It's really nice.


624
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:52,186
I can open it up, animates in.


625
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:57,796
From the side bar, we also have
access to our shared links.


626
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:01,216
You see sites that I'm following
here on Twitter and LinkedIn


627
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:03,996
and click on a site-- a
link that's been shared.


628
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:07,686
It loads it up, I can
even retweet it right here


629
00:35:07,686 --> 00:35:08,646
if I-- if I wish.


630
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:10,626
And we now have one-click
bookmarking


631
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:12,446
so I'll just click this plus
and it's going to hop right


632
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,276
in to my Reading
List right there.


633
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:16,186
Let's go take a look
at my Reading List.


634
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,826
See all the articles I've
added here to my Reading List?


635
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:22,596
I want you to watch how
scrolling works because now,


636
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,166
when I scroll and I'm
reading through one article,


637
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:27,746
I read this, this is great,
I'm really enjoying it.


638
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:30,036
Get to the bottom,
there's the next article.


639
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:32,926
I can just scroll right
through to the next article just


640
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:33,376
like that.


641
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:40,106
Awesome. We also have a
beautiful new look for Reader.


642
00:35:40,106 --> 00:35:43,476
Here is Reader and I'm
going to bring up my--


643
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:46,526
I can actually close
up my sidebar here.


644
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:49,896
And now, as I scroll reading
and I just want to read


645
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:52,466
from one article to the
next, it's just like that.


646
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:57,166
Super clean and super nice and
that's Safari in Mavericks.


647
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:57,966
I think you're going to like it.


648
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:03,826
[ Applause ]


649
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:05,916
So, we have some
more improvements


650
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,336
that I think are going to really
help you with your browsing


651
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:11,586
and one of them is
iCloud Keychain, yeah.


652
00:36:14,516 --> 00:36:17,246
You know, to really
be secure these days,


653
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:20,896
you want to have a different
complex password for every site


654
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:23,396
where you have a log in
but this inevitably brings


655
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:25,716
up the question,
"what's my password?"


656
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:28,516
and these solutions
are not recommended.


657
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:30,676
There is a better way.


658
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:34,356
With iCloud Keychain, we can
remember your website logins,


659
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,706
your credit card numbers,
even your Wi-Fi networks


660
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:44,126
and they're always encrypted,
synced across all of your system


661
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:45,466
so they are always
available to you.


662
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:48,106
Now, when you go to
sign up for a website,


663
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:51,706
you can of course enter your own
password and we'll remember it


664
00:36:51,706 --> 00:36:56,136
but as well, Safari can auto
suggest a password for you.


665
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:59,856
You don't have to remember that
but it'll enter it in for you


666
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,156
and then sync it across
all of your systems


667
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:03,616
and login for you from then on.


668
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:11,026
[ Applause ]


669
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:14,456
iCloud Keychain is great
for your shopping as well.


670
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:18,916
When you come to a credit card
field, you can suggest any


671
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,626
of your remembered
credit cards, select one


672
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:24,476
and it'll just enter it in
for you just like that along


673
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,526
with your expiration date.


674
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,766
But you have to remember
your own security code,


675
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,446
that's what makes
it secure after all


676
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:31,976
and that's iCloud Keychain.

678
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:40,916
Next, some improvements
to Notifications.


679
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:45,636
So now, with Notifications on
the Mac, if you're a Californian


680
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:48,186
like me, you'll often get
this kind of notification,


681
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,816
"Hey want to go surf
these 30 foot waves?"


682
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:53,896
And you response, surely is
to mouse over the notification


683
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,736
and immediately right there,
reply, "Yeah sure I'm going


684
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:57,796
to surf that 30 foot wave."


685
00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:01,456
You can reply right inside the
Notification and you can do this


686
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:02,626
for things like email


687
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:04,776
and quickly delete email
you might not want to deal


688
00:38:04,776 --> 00:38:06,576
with without even
having to go to Mail.


689
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:09,936
If you get a FaceTime call,
you can response saying,


690
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,866
"Hey I'm going to call
you later," or remind


691
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,336
without having to
pick up the call.


692
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:14,496
It's really handy.


693
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,616
We also handle a new
kind of notification.


694
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:21,676
So if you have an app today
that sends push notifications


695
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,686
to iOS devices, well
now, you can sign


696
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:27,126
up to receive those push
notifications on your Mac


697
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:29,886
as well whether Safari
is running or not.


698
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:36,356
So, things like your
Fantasy Football alert,


699
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:42,926
maybe Breaking News, news
about that buy on eBay.


700
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:48,346
And now, in Mavericks when
your machine is sleeping,


701
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:51,906
when you wake it up, it
will tell you everything


702
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:54,296
that you missed while you're
away right on the lock screen.


703
00:38:55,056 --> 00:39:00,316
And it will now update apps
for you right in the background


704
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:01,976
so you don't have
to do it yourself.

Absolutely no virtual cows
were harmed in the making


710
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:29,746
of this user interface.


711
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:30,676
We're going to be
adding that one


712
00:39:30,756 --> 00:39:32,786
to our environmental
checklist, trust us.


713
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:37,996
So, in addition to that, you
have your Facebook events right


714
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:39,526
on your Calendar if you wish


715
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:42,306
and we have a great new
inspector that's even aware


716
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:46,116
of things like location,
travel time and weather.


717
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:48,556

The Maps team has been making
great improvements to the data


722
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:05,656
and Maps and Mac users
are going to benefit


723
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,676
because we have this
fantastic new Maps app.


724
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:11,466
Of course, with your street
maps, you have your 3D,


725
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:15,966
beautiful flyover
data, search for points

00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:18,516
of interest, great info cards.


727
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:23,506
You can get turn by turn
directions and my favorite part,


728
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:26,246
when I have a route that
I've set up on my Mac


729
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:30,096
and now it's time to go, you
can just click right up here


730
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:32,436
and send it right to my iPhone


731
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:34,456
where it will appear
right on my lock screen.

733
00:40:40,596 --> 00:40:43,306
And when I unlock my
phone, it takes me straight


734
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:45,156
in the navigation, super cool.


735
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:48,186
We're also providing
a developer SDK


736
00:40:48,186 --> 00:40:50,176
so you can add mapping
functionality


737
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,526
to your apps as well.


738
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:51,906
So that's Maps.


739
00:40:51,906 --> 00:41:01,496
Finally, we're bringing
iBooks to the Mac.


740
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:10,446

to the full library

of 1.8 million books
in the iBook Store.

00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:17,886
Your full library from your
iOS devices is available


743
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:18,816
on your Mac as well.


744
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:21,486
It's a great environment
for reading.

00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:23,816

environment for taking notes

751
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:47,706
So here we are in
Paris, you can just zoom


752
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:48,776
in a place in Paris there.


753

you see it's just so fast

and fluid bringing in
points of location.


755
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:57,466
I can pan around the map
to find a nice location,


756
00:41:58,146 --> 00:42:00,826
maybe the Eiffel
Tower right here.


757

Let's go in to look
at that flyover data.


758
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:12,066
As we can see the Eiffel Tower,
we can go in to tilt it over,

that's the Eiffel
Tower right there.

The flyover data is just
beautiful and of course,


761
00:42:20,076 --> 00:42:25,196
I can even rotate around Paris.

the Eiffel Tower as it rotates


763

into the area of the city below.

The data is just gorgeous,
the new flyover data.

It's really amazing on
your big Mac display.

Of course, we support great
search for points of interest


767
00:42:38,646 --> 00:42:40,136
so if I want to go
to lunch, maybe at --


768
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:41,476
I'm told this is Guy Savoy.

have this great info cards


770

with reviews, photos.


771
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:54,166
I can add a site to my
Bookmarks just like this


772
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:57,756
and it's now synced
across all my devices


773
00:42:57,756 --> 00:43:00,236
so this location is available
to me, of course, on my phone.


774
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,086
And because this is a
Mac, I can tear this off


775
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:04,016
so if I'm planning a trip,


776
00:43:04,056 --> 00:43:05,896
I can set aside some
things of interest.


777
00:43:06,926 --> 00:43:08,146
I can, of course,
get directions.

Let's do that here, directions
from the Eiffel Tower.

go, I can send it right

what's really amazing is even

right there on the screen.

It doesn't fall off
without the stitching.

It's engineering.


790
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:47,736
It's really great for
creating events so if I go


791
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:49,456
and create an event like
this, let's say I'm going


792
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:53,216
to have lunch and I'm going to
type in what I want for lunch,

all sorts of locations nearby

so I'm going to select
Tony's Pizza


796

and you notice I get a map.


797
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:06,346
I even get projected weather
for that location so I know


798
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:07,756
if I need to bring a jacket.


799
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:10,676
Now, I can select here
and actually ask it


800
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:13,876
to tell me what the
travel time is expected


801
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:16,786
from my last location
so I can decide


802
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:17,756
if I want to drive or walk.


803
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,056
I'm going to say I want to walk


804
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,836
and it actually adds the travel
time right to my Calendar


805
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:23,416

schedule anything there.

way the cellular structure works

00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,076
You can use them to
navigate your book.


843
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:34,106
When it comes time to study,
you have this great study cards,


844
00:46:34,106 --> 00:46:37,276
you can just flip through
them, use all your notes


845
00:46:37,276 --> 00:46:38,656
to study, just like that.

847
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:48,906
And that is iBooks in Mavericks.


848
00:46:49,026 --> 00:46:56,146
So, Mavericks continues making
your digital life follow you


849
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,006
easily from device to device.


850
00:46:58,006 --> 00:47:01,556
So now, your books are available
on whatever device you choose


851
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:04,636
to read them on and it remembers
what page you're reading.


852
00:47:05,036 --> 00:47:07,756
We now remember your password
so they're available to you


853
00:47:07,756 --> 00:47:09,936
across all your devices,
even now,


854
00:47:10,146 --> 00:47:13,536

and travel routes.


855
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:16,836
Mavericks is a fantastic
release,


856
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:21,066
it's full of some great features
for power users, deep technology


857
00:47:21,066 --> 00:47:24,156
to extend your battery life and
improve system responsiveness


858
00:47:24,696 --> 00:47:27,206
and some great features
for everyone.


859
00:47:28,276 --> 00:47:29,556
For those of you developers,


860
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:32,976
we have a preview
available for you today.


861
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:39,126
[ Applause ]


862
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:41,996
And for everyone else
from the general public,


863
00:47:41,996 --> 00:47:44,726
you'll be getting the
final release this fall.


864
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,876
So that is Mavericks.


865
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:49,096
Next, I'm going to hand
it over to Phil Schiller


866
00:47:49,096 --> 00:47:50,636
to tell you a little
bit more about the Mac.


867
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:51,506
Thank you.


868
00:47:52,516 --> 00:48:01,226
[ Applause ]


869
00:48:01,726 --> 00:48:03,056
>> Well, good morning everyone.


870
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:08,796
I'd like to talk to you
about the MacBook Air.


871
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:12,736
The MacBook Air answer
the question in this age


872
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:15,846
of the iPad, what is the
future of the notebook?


873
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:19,096
The MacBook Air really
gave us a direction


874
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,816
of where the notebook can go,


875
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:23,856
and it's really become
everyone's ultimate


876
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,046
everyday notebook.


877
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:28,776
And that's why we're really
pleased to tell you today


878
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:32,656
that we've updated an entirely
new line of MacBook Air.


879
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:36,296
And these new MacBook Airs
deliver the most important


880
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:37,736
feature we always want


881
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:42,696
in a portable device,
all day battery life.


882
00:48:42,696 --> 00:48:42,866
Yes.


883
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:47,286
[ Applause ]


884
00:48:47,786 --> 00:48:49,686
And the MacBook Air is based


885
00:48:49,686 --> 00:48:52,926
on a new 4th Generation
Intel Core Processor,


886
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:55,486
otherwise known as Haswell ULT.


887
00:48:55,486 --> 00:48:59,366
And if you don't know Haswell
ULT, it's a great processor


888
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,506
for incredible power savings.


889
00:49:01,736 --> 00:49:03,996
There's more energy-efficient
CPUs,


890
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:06,316
there's twice the
graphics execution units


891
00:49:06,656 --> 00:49:08,796
so we can run them actually
to slower clock speed


892
00:49:08,796 --> 00:49:12,466
to save energy and still
deliver the 40 percent faster


893
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:13,506
graphics performance.


894
00:49:14,046 --> 00:49:15,776
And the Apple engineers
have worked together


895
00:49:15,776 --> 00:49:19,436
with the Intel engineers on
some great low power state


896
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:21,636
so we can do things
like wake in one second


897
00:49:21,886 --> 00:49:24,406
or standby for up to 30 days.


898
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,896
But the biggest benefit
is battery life


899
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:29,666
so here is the current
generation MacBook Air,


900
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:31,536
11 inch and 13 inch.


901
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:35,266
The 11 inch is now going to go
from 5 hours of battery life


902
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:43,866
up to an incredible 9
hours of battery life.


903
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:46,436
And if you like that,
the 13 inch goes from 7


904
00:49:46,436 --> 00:49:51,306
to 12 hours of battery life.


905
00:49:51,306 --> 00:49:54,266
Yes, true, all day
battery life and it helps


906
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:55,676
across your entire system.


907
00:49:56,016 --> 00:49:58,716
For example, if you like
watching movies from iTunes,


908
00:49:58,716 --> 00:50:01,976
up to 10 hours, you can watch
almost the entire Trilogy


909
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:03,966
of Lord of the Rings,
it's amazing.


910
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:07,376
And of course, MacBook Air
is based entirely on Flash.


911
00:50:07,636 --> 00:50:10,286
Flash is faster, up
to 45 percent faster


912
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:13,466
than the previous version
and Wi-Fi is faster too,


913
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:16,126
now 802.11ac Wi-Fi networking.


914
00:50:18,496 --> 00:50:21,536
Now, ac gets you up to
three times the performance


915
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:24,216
of 802.11n at the same distance.


916
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:27,186
But the way to get that of
course is you want your MacBook


917
00:50:27,186 --> 00:50:31,816
Air to talk to a Wi-Fi base
station that supports 802.11ac.


918
00:50:32,036 --> 00:50:33,366
So, we're really happy to along


919
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:37,156
with MacBook Air announce some
new AirPort Base Stations,


920
00:50:37,486 --> 00:50:41,636
entirely new designs, they're
actually a very small base,


921
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:44,726
just 4 inches square but
extruded 6 and a half inches


922
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:46,906
to get wider range
from those antennas.


923
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:50,556
So there's a new AirPort
Extreme that does 802.11ac.


924
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,696
There's also room in
there for a hard drive


925
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:55,076
so you have a new AirPort
Time Capsule as well


926
00:50:55,076 --> 00:50:57,116
and these are great
base stations.


927
00:50:57,426 --> 00:50:58,746
They're incredibly powerful,


928
00:50:58,746 --> 00:51:00,266
they have a lot of
cool features.


929
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,116
I'll just point out one,


930
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,576
beamforming, it even
sounds cool.


931
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:08,456
Beamforming can send more energy
directly to an 802.11ac device


932
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:10,536
to enhance the throughput
and performance.


933
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:12,406
So, these are great
base stations.


934
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:16,566
The MacBook Air comes in
11 inch and 13 inches sizes


935
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:19,016
and the value is even
greater than before.


936
00:51:19,016 --> 00:51:20,816
The 11 inch starts at 999


937
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:23,856
with 128 gigabytes
that's twice the storage


938
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:25,586
at the same price as before.


939
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:29,676
And the 13 inch with
128 gigs starts at 1099,


940
00:51:29,676 --> 00:51:32,156
that's 100 dollars less
expensive than before.


941
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:35,316
And these new MacBook
Airs start shipping today.


942

[ Applause ]


943
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,516
As we have for a while
now, we're really proud


944
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:46,696
that we lead the industry


945
00:51:46,696 --> 00:51:50,666
in the most environmentally
friendly products so we're going


946
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:53,456
to make sure everyone
knows how important this is


947
00:51:53,456 --> 00:51:56,566
to have Energy Star 5.2,
most products don't.


948
00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:00,286
EPEAT Gold, most on
arsenic-free display glass,


949
00:52:00,556 --> 00:52:05,766
mercury-free displays, BFR-free,
PVC-free, and highly recyclable.


950
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:07,976
We lead at this and we're
going to continue to.


951
00:52:08,436 --> 00:52:09,966
So, that's the new MacBook Air.


952
00:52:10,466 --> 00:52:15,576
They're faster graphics, longer
battery life, better value,


953
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:18,376
faster Wi-Fi, incredible
notebooks.


954
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,976
Let me do something different.


955
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:23,896
We don't usually do this


956
00:52:23,946 --> 00:52:25,966
but you're really an
important audience so we'd

like to give you a sneak peek
of something we're working on.

964
00:52:50,406 --> 00:52:54,406
graphic designers count
on products like Mac Pro


965
00:52:54,406 --> 00:52:58,706
to get their work done and our
most advanced users just want


966
00:52:58,706 --> 00:53:00,496
to get their hands
on the fastest,


967
00:53:00,496 --> 00:53:01,946
most expandable Mac we make.


968
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:05,616
And the Mac Pro is really
important to delivering on that.


969
00:53:06,466 --> 00:53:08,746
We didn't want to just
make another version


970
00:53:08,746 --> 00:53:11,176
of the same old desktop
idea that everyone has had.


971
00:53:11,176 --> 00:53:12,456
Like with MacBook Air,


972
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:15,526
our engineering team has spent
quite a bit of time thinking


973
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:19,856
about the technology available
today and what could be possible


974
00:53:19,856 --> 00:53:21,936
for the future of a Pro desktop.


975
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:24,526
What would be a new
formed factor, new design,


976
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:27,666
new capabilities for
another 10 years?


977
00:53:28,856 --> 00:53:30,186
And the engineering
team has come


978
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:34,746
up with something truly
revolutionary, truly radical


979
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,316
and this product is so cool.


980
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,836
We'll, I'm going to go
a little over the top


981
00:53:40,386 --> 00:53:43,996
and give it a grand introduction


982
00:53:44,446 --> 00:53:47,596
that is unlike any introduction
we've ever had for a product.


983
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:52,416
So, I am really pleased to
give you our, closest friends,


984
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:56,356

around a new unified
thermal core.

Internal storage
is based on flash.

00:56:28,726 --> 00:56:30,916
That's two and a
half times faster


1011
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:32,306
than any flash we've ever built.


1012
00:56:32,646 --> 00:56:35,566
It's 10 times faster than
any hard drive we've put


1013
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:36,706
in a Mac Pro before.


1014
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:41,446
All expansion is external,
you can add storage arrays,


1015
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:43,166
you can add expansion chassis


1016
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:48,306
over the brand new announced
Thunderbolt 2, it's 20 gigabit


1017
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:53,036
for seconds up to six
Thunderbolt 2 devices per port.


1018
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:56,346
It's backwards compatible with
Thunderbolt 1 and FireWire


1019
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,466
and it's double the performance
of the industry's standard


1020
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:01,516
and industry of leading
Thunderbolt 1.


1021
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:05,736
But the place where the team has
probably gone, the most crazy


1022
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,206
and done something we've never
done before is in graphics.


1023
00:57:08,546 --> 00:57:11,846
This is the first Mac
ever that comes standard


1024
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:17,226
with dual workstation GPUs,
AMD FirePro graphics in it.


1025
00:57:17,596 --> 00:57:21,306
You can configure it up to
4,096 screen processors,


1026
00:57:22,016 --> 00:57:24,886
528 gigabytes per seconds.


1027
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:28,276
This is two and a half times
the graphics performance


1028
00:57:28,276 --> 00:57:29,496
in the last generation.


1029
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:31,696
And for those of
you who use OpenCL


1030
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:35,556
and you all know you should,
this delivers seven teraflops


1031
00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:37,676
of compute power to
your applications.


1032
00:57:38,386 --> 00:57:41,716
Of course, you want to hook on
the latest third party displays


1033
00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:44,336
and this supports 4K displays.


1034
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:49,996
Yes, multiple streams
of 4K displays.


1035
00:57:50,526 --> 00:57:53,356
You can have up to
three 4K displays


1036
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:59,586
on the built-in dual
workstation graphics.


1037
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:01,836
The Final Cut Pro team is
hard at work in a version


1038
00:58:01,836 --> 00:58:04,416
of Final Cut Pro X that will
support all the performance


1039
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:05,816
and graphics capabilities


1040
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,486
of this Machine,
you can be this guy.


1041
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:15,136
It is a Mac unlike
any we've ever made.


1042
00:58:15,136 --> 00:58:18,886
It delivers so much more
performance, capabilities


1043
00:58:18,886 --> 00:58:20,896
and expansion than
anything we've made


1044
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:23,476
and here it is alongside
the previous generation.


1045
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:29,176
[ Applause ]


1046
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:31,126
The team has packed all


1047
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:35,086
of its capability inside
one eighth the volume


1048
00:58:35,086 --> 00:58:36,156
of the previous generation.


1049
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:37,876
The one thing everyone loved


1050
00:58:37,876 --> 00:58:40,336
about the old generation Mac
Pro is those handles on the top


1051
00:58:40,336 --> 00:58:43,576
so you can move it around
to get access to the I/O.


1052
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:47,916
Well, the entire top of the new
generation Mac Pro is a handle.


1053
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:50,616
Just put your hand in it,
you can spin it around,


1054
00:58:51,056 --> 00:58:52,546
get access to the I/O.


1055
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:55,316
It's all organized
beautifully on the back for you.


1056
00:58:55,646 --> 00:59:01,106
There is audio, four USB 3,
six FireWire 2 being driven


1057
00:59:01,106 --> 00:59:04,326
by three FireWire 2
controllers and you guys


1058
00:59:04,326 --> 00:59:05,976
who use this stuff know
what I'm talking about.


1059
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:10,836
It's gigabit Ethernet, HDMI
out and it has a motion sensor


1060
00:59:10,836 --> 00:59:12,966
so when you turn
it, it even lights


1061
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,386
up to show you where the I/O is.


1062
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:21,066
[ Applause ]


1063
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:24,146
It is a stunning product.


1064
00:59:24,246 --> 00:59:28,496
This is without doubt the
future of the Pro desktop.


1065
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:31,466
It is coming later this year.


1066
00:59:31,466 --> 00:59:33,106
I did say this is a sneak peek.


1067
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:36,456
It is designed by brilliant
engineers in California


1068
00:59:36,456 --> 00:59:38,866
and assembled here in the USA.


1069
00:59:39,516 --> 00:59:45,316
[ Applause ]


1070
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:50,076
And for all of you who are dying
to see it put towards places


1071
00:59:50,076 --> 00:59:53,086
and what it can do, we have
a special session tomorrow,


1072
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:55,586
lunch time session for
all the developers here,


1073
00:59:55,836 --> 00:59:59,106
for our good friends at
Pixar along with developers


1074
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:00,366
from The Foundry are going


1075
01:00:00,366 --> 01:00:02,536
to show you some amazing
character animation


1076
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:06,036
in the upcoming movie
"Monsters U" running


1077
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,736
on the new generation Mac Pro
and you want to check it out.


1078
01:00:08,736 --> 01:00:11,896
And that's the Mac
Pro, back to you, Tim.


1079
01:00:12,516 --> 01:00:21,226
[ Applause ]


1080
01:00:21,726 --> 01:00:24,406
>> You're going to love
the Mac Pro, it's killer.


1081
01:00:25,346 --> 01:00:27,976
Next, I'd like to
talk about iCloud.


1082
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:34,416
We've now passed 300 million
iCloud accounts making iCloud


1083
01:00:34,416 --> 01:00:37,386
the fastest growing
Cloud service ever.


1084
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:43,896
Now, by comparison, it
took Facebook five years


1085
01:00:43,896 --> 01:00:45,136
to reach this many accounts.


1086
01:00:46,126 --> 01:00:50,036
One of the most popular features
of iCloud is iTunes in the Cloud


1087
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:52,946
which makes all of your
purchase content available


1088
01:00:52,946 --> 01:00:54,126
on all of your devices.


1089
01:00:54,796 --> 01:00:58,676
We now have 300 million users
of this feature and they read


1090
01:00:58,676 --> 01:01:02,946
out of their content
35 billion times.


1091
01:01:04,026 --> 01:01:08,216
Now, the back-end infrastructure
of iCloud allows us


1092
01:01:08,216 --> 01:01:11,456
to provide Cloud services
across many of our products


1093
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:15,396
like Game Center, our
social gaming network now


1094
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:18,136
with over 240 million users.


1095
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:21,176
Sixty of the top 100 games


1096
01:01:21,176 --> 01:01:24,496
on the App Store integrate
Game Center support right


1097
01:01:24,496 --> 01:01:25,286
in their game.


1098
01:01:26,556 --> 01:01:30,776
iCloud is also --
has incredible scale


1099
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:35,106
like sending 800
billion iMessages,


1100
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:40,796
or a mind-boggling 7.4
trillion push notifications.


1101
01:01:44,516 --> 01:01:48,776
iCloud allows us to seamlessly
integrate Cloud services


1102
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:50,476
into so many of our products


1103
01:01:50,556 --> 01:01:54,786
across Apple in both
OS X and iOS.


1104
01:01:56,316 --> 01:02:01,636
Today, we want to share with
you how we're deeply integrating


1105
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:05,256
iCloud into the next
version of iWork.


1106
01:02:05,776 --> 01:02:08,596
And to do that, I'd like
to invite Roger Rosner


1107
01:02:08,596 --> 01:02:09,596
up to the stage.


1108
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:10,646
Roger.


1109
01:02:11,516 --> 01:02:17,146
[ Applause ]


1110
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:20,516
>> Hello. Hi, let me tell
you a little bit about iWork.


1111
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:23,426
iWork is pages, numbers,
and keynote.


1112
01:02:23,896 --> 01:02:26,766
And we think it's the best way
to create beautiful documents,


1113
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:28,416
spreadsheets and presentations.


1114
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:32,716
Of course, iWork was born on
the Mac and it has full support


1115
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:36,166
for the awesome feature set
of Mac OS X and Mac hardware.


1116
01:02:37,036 --> 01:02:40,416
We also have amazingly powerful
and fully multi-touch versions


1117
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:43,766
of these apps on the
iPad and on the iPhone.


1118
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:46,996
We think our multi-touch
apps are the most powerful


1119
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,666
productivity apps ever
created for a mobile device.


1120
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:53,386
And later this year, we're going
to have awesome new releases


1121
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,326
of both our Mac and
our iOS suites.


1122
01:02:57,236 --> 01:03:00,996
But today, I want to
introduce the newest member


1123
01:03:00,996 --> 01:03:06,006
of the iWork family,
introducing iWork for iCloud.


1124
01:03:07,086 --> 01:03:10,726
iWork for iCloud lets you
create beautiful documents right


1125
01:03:10,726 --> 01:03:13,836
in a browser on a
Mac or on a PC.


1126
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:16,476
And rather than talk about it,


1127
01:03:16,606 --> 01:03:17,946
let's just jump right
into a demo.


1128

[ Applause ]


1129
01:03:25,486 --> 01:03:28,746
All right, I'm going to fire
up Safari on my Mac here


1130
01:03:29,496 --> 01:03:32,216
and go straight to
my iCloud homepage


1131
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:36,166
where you see three new app
icons, and I click on Pages.


1132
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:41,326
And here is all the documents
I've been working on, on my Mac


1133
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:43,236
or my iPad and saved in iCloud.


1134
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,596
I can create a new document by
clicking Plus and I have a bunch


1135
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:48,306
of beautiful Apple-designed
templates.


1136
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:51,896
But let's just open a
document we were working on.


1137
01:03:55,846 --> 01:03:58,866
And as you can see, it's a
beautiful Pages document,


1138
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:03,946
great fonts, graphics,
images, page layouts.


1139
01:04:04,626 --> 01:04:08,886
This is all happening in
a web browser of course.


1140
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:11,586
So I can just click
here and type.


1141
01:04:12,346 --> 01:04:17,296
And over here, I have all
the formatting controls


1142
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:19,336
in our new context-sensitive
format panel.


1143
01:04:19,336 --> 01:04:23,926
So I'll just select some
text, go up to my Styles,


1144
01:04:24,216 --> 01:04:29,666
choose a text style, select
some more text, choose another.


1145
01:04:30,426 --> 01:04:33,036
I can click on some images.


1146
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:36,296
And you see, my controls
now show me Image Controls.


1147
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:39,836
I can click on a bunch of
styles, choose that one.


1148
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:43,656
Now, of course, Pages has always
been great at handling graphics.


1149
01:04:43,786 --> 01:04:45,426
So, how do I add graphics?


1150
01:04:45,426 --> 01:04:48,346
Well, I drag one
in from my desktop,


1151
01:04:49,336 --> 01:04:52,466
drop it in there
and drag it around.

01:05:00,036 --> 01:05:00,516
All right.


1154
01:05:00,516 --> 01:05:02,266
Now, we know we live
in a world full


1155
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:05,526
of Microsoft Office documents,
so how do we work with Office?


1156
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:09,066
Well I have a Word document
here, and I'm just going to drag


1157
01:05:09,066 --> 01:05:10,776
that in from my desktop and drop


1158
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:12,696
that in the Pages
for iCloud window.


1159
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:14,246
It uploads it.


1160
01:05:15,026 --> 01:05:15,936

has a bunch of different sheets

in it, great charts,
great tables and graphics.


1170

in a cell, hit Equals.

a little thicker.

that same document.

As you can see, it's the same,
there's the slide we just made.

Let's go in there and make
that mask a little bit tighter

That is iWork for iCloud.

Now, we know, in a lot of cases,


1222
01:08:42,176 --> 01:08:43,876
that the best user
experiences are made


1223
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:45,156
with native app technologies.


1224
01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:47,345
But I think you can
see with iWork


1225
01:08:47,345 --> 01:08:49,636
for iCloud you can do some
pretty great stuff on the web.


1226

As I mentioned, we
support IE or--


1227

we support Safari

1228

Like all websites, we
run best in Safari.

and we're proud of it,

but it's not what drives us.


1250

We want to make the best
products that people use more


1251
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:10,526
and love more than
anyone else's.


1252
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,436
And I'm really happy
to tell you,


1253
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:16,866
people are using our
products substantially more


1254
01:10:16,866 --> 01:10:17,726
than anyone else's.


1255
01:10:18,526 --> 01:10:19,276
Let me show you.


1256
01:10:20,356 --> 01:10:24,936
This recent study from Experian
showed that iPhone users use


1257
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:30,516
of iPhone 50 percent more than
Android users use their phone.


1258
01:10:31,336 --> 01:10:34,486
Now this is incredible
but may be not surprising.


1259
01:10:34,486 --> 01:10:43,026
And if you look at mobile web
share, it's not even close.


1260
01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:47,716
iOS is two and a
half times Android.


1261
01:10:47,716 --> 01:10:52,526
And if you look at iPads
compared to all other tablets,


1262
01:10:53,076 --> 01:10:54,456
it's not even comparable.


1263
01:10:55,326 --> 01:10:57,966
iPad is over four times more.


1264
01:10:59,466 --> 01:11:01,626
Now this shows up in
a variety of ways.


1265
01:11:01,626 --> 01:11:06,556
As an example, just like
iOS customers buy more


1266
01:11:06,556 --> 01:11:11,646
of your incredible apps,
they evidently also buy a lot


1267
01:11:11,646 --> 01:11:14,426
of everything else according
to a recent IBM survey.


1268
01:11:15,536 --> 01:11:19,456
Both iPhone and iPad
customers were responsible


1269
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:22,696
for materially more
mobile shopping traffic


1270
01:11:23,126 --> 01:11:26,776
than all other Android
devices combined


1271

on the most critical day
of shopping last year.


1272
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,136
Now, it probably
doesn't surprise you


1273
01:11:33,316 --> 01:11:37,256
if people are using them
more, they love them more.


1274
01:11:38,266 --> 01:11:43,276
And this is what is
most important to us.

nine consecutive times.

has ever been done.

And iOS satisfaction is
literally off the charts.

Change Wage [phonetic] recently
measured it at 97 percent.

people that responded


1283

that they're very satisfied
and really look at the detail


1284
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:23,966
which I'm sometimes known to
do, you would see that iOS blows


1285
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:27,276

20 points better


1286
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,356
than our closest competitor


1287

better than Android.

1289
01:12:39,136 --> 01:12:41,246
One of the reasons for this is

that we provide amazing
software updates


1291

that provide users
incredible new features.

to as many users as possible.

01:12:57,386 --> 01:13:03,326
Over 90 percent of iOS users are
using the latest version of iOS.


1296
01:13:03,326 --> 01:13:08,256
Now, that's in stark contrast
to the world of Android.


1297
01:13:10,106 --> 01:13:14,646
And by the way, this is the
most ideal state of Android.


1298
01:13:14,646 --> 01:13:17,686
It only includes us version
of Android which talk


1299
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:19,156
to the Google Play store.


1300
01:13:19,476 --> 01:13:21,986
So it doesn't things
like Kindles and Nooks.


1301
01:13:23,136 --> 01:13:26,486
But even then, it's
a pretty bleak story.


1302
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:31,826
More than a third of Android
users are using an operating


1303
01:13:31,936 --> 01:13:36,986
system that was released
in 2010.


1304
01:13:37,116 --> 01:13:41,276
And if you look at the customers
of each operating system


1305
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:45,946
which are using the latest
version, it's not even close.

Now this isn't just
bad for users,


1307

but this version
fragmentation is terrible


1308

for developers as
many of you know.


1309
01:13:57,836 --> 01:14:00,606
In fact, if you do the
math, you would find


1310
01:14:00,606 --> 01:14:05,736
that iOS 6 is the world's most
popular mobile operating system


1311
01:14:06,326 --> 01:14:09,216
and in second place is
a version of Android

which was released in 2010.


1313

Now this is why we get so
excited when we're working


1314
01:14:18,866 --> 01:14:22,726
on a new version of
iOS because we know

that we can positively
affect millions of developers

what we've been up to.

01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,316
You don't even have
to unlock your device.


1509
01:26:51,846 --> 01:26:55,626
[applause] So that's
a quick look at iOS 7.


1510
01:26:56,146 --> 01:27:01,026
It's a comprehensive end-to-end
redesign of the user experience.


1511
01:27:01,846 --> 01:27:04,416
Installing iOS 7
on your phone is


1512
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:06,176
like getting an entirely
new phone,


1513
01:27:06,176 --> 01:27:08,556
but when you already
know how to use,


1514
01:27:09,046 --> 01:27:12,826
when it's so much more beautiful
and functional than ever before.


1515
01:27:14,456 --> 01:27:16,966
But iOS 7 is actually
more than that.


1516
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:20,266
It's also a major
feature release as well.


1517
01:27:20,266 --> 01:27:23,346
I have 10 features I want
to talk to you about today,


1518
01:27:23,766 --> 01:27:26,226
starting with Control Center.


1519
01:27:27,646 --> 01:27:29,036
Control Center is
something that's


1520
01:27:29,356 --> 01:27:31,396
so simple and yet so essential.


1521
01:27:31,926 --> 01:27:34,036
You have those switches
that you just want to get


1522
01:27:34,036 --> 01:27:35,816
to really quickly
from wherever you are.


1523
01:27:35,906 --> 01:27:38,966
Well, now, with Control Center,
swipe up from that bottom


1524
01:27:38,966 --> 01:27:41,376
of the device and
there they are.


1525
01:27:42,516 --> 01:27:46,476
[ Applause ]


1526
01:27:46,976 --> 01:27:50,646
Turn on Airplane Mode, adjust
your brightness, play a song,


1527
01:27:51,476 --> 01:27:57,096
even get at a flashlight,
and available from anywhere,


1528
01:27:57,096 --> 01:27:58,306
including your lock screen.


1529
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,286
So if you wake up in the middle
of the night and you need


1530
01:28:00,286 --> 01:28:02,876
to find something, your
flashlight's right there.


1531
01:28:03,586 --> 01:28:05,126
And that's Control Center.


1532
01:28:05,846 --> 01:28:08,636
Next, let's talk
about Multitasking.


1533
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:12,976
Now, iOS 7 has always been built


1534
01:28:12,976 --> 01:28:16,266
on the industrial strength
foundations of OS X.


1535
01:28:17,206 --> 01:28:20,876
It's had intrinsic powerful
multitasking capabilities.


1536
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:23,156
But we had to be careful
about how we'd exposed these


1537
01:28:23,156 --> 01:28:26,266
to applications because we want
to preserve great battery life.


1538
01:28:27,246 --> 01:28:31,696
Now on iOS 4 we did add
support for select kinds


1539
01:28:31,696 --> 01:28:33,536
of applications to
do multitasking.


1540
01:28:33,596 --> 01:28:37,216
Things like plain music in the
background or receiving a voice


1541
01:28:37,216 --> 01:28:40,246
over IP call, or your
app is in the background.


1542
01:28:40,806 --> 01:28:44,026
Well, now, in iOS 7, I'm pleased
to announce that we're going


1543
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:48,976
to have multitasking for all
apps with great battery life.


1544
01:28:49,516 --> 01:28:55,076
[ Applause ]


1545
01:28:55,576 --> 01:28:56,466
So, how does it work?


1546
01:28:57,386 --> 01:28:58,836
Well, imagine you have an app


1547
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,436
that you're using
constantly throughout the day,


1548
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,986
a social networking app or
something and you're checking


1549
01:29:03,986 --> 01:29:07,176
in all of the time, what iOS
7 has noticed is that pattern


1550
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:08,816
of use and is going
to provide that app


1551
01:29:08,816 --> 01:29:11,866
with frequent background
activity to stay up to date.


1552
01:29:11,866 --> 01:29:15,226
And there's even other app you
used, maybe that you just check


1553
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:17,786
in on in the morning or
breakfast, maybe at night


1554
01:29:17,816 --> 01:29:20,356
after work, well iOS
7 notices that too.


1555
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:23,646
And it's going to give that
app background cycles just


1556
01:29:23,646 --> 01:29:25,836
in time to-- it's up to
date for when you need it.


1557
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:29,716
Now, in addition to this
intelligence scheduling,


1558
01:29:30,176 --> 01:29:32,746
iOS 7 does opportunistic
updates.


1559
01:29:33,106 --> 01:29:36,146
The average user wakes their
device dozens of time a day


1560
01:29:36,146 --> 01:29:37,696
and those provide
great opportunities


1561
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:39,216
when the system's
already powered


1562
01:29:39,216 --> 01:29:41,316
up to update apps
on the background.


1563
01:29:42,066 --> 01:29:44,616
It also adapts intelligently
the network conditions.


1564
01:29:45,056 --> 01:29:46,856
So if it's in-- you
have good coverage,


1565
01:29:47,096 --> 01:29:48,466
it's a great time to fetch.


1566
01:29:49,286 --> 01:29:52,586
And it coalesces updates
across multiple applications.


1567
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:54,396
So once you have those
radios powered up,


1568
01:29:54,396 --> 01:29:57,156
lets multiple applications
take advantage of it


1569
01:29:57,156 --> 01:29:58,366
for their background updates.


1570
01:29:58,806 --> 01:30:03,206
And, finally, iOS 7 response to
push notifications as a trigger


1571
01:30:03,206 --> 01:30:05,956
to give that application
time in the background.


1572
01:30:06,046 --> 01:30:07,136
So when you follow
that notification,


1573
01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:08,516
the app will already
be up to date.


1574
01:30:09,516 --> 01:30:14,786
[ Applause ]


1575
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:18,536
Now, iOS 7 also has a great
new user interface for moving


1576
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:20,846
between all the things you
have going on on your phone.


1577
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:25,446
Now, you could double click and
move into Notifications Center


1578
01:30:25,446 --> 01:30:27,586
and just swipe between
your running applications,


1579
01:30:27,706 --> 01:30:32,236
tap and move right in and
that is multitasking in iOS 7.


1580
01:30:33,516 --> 01:30:38,226
[ Applause ]


1581
01:30:38,726 --> 01:30:40,736
Next, let's talk about Safari.


1582
01:30:41,466 --> 01:30:45,496
Safari is the most popular
mobile browser in the world.


1583
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:48,386
And in iOS 7 we're
making it even better.


1584
01:30:49,726 --> 01:30:52,836
Has a great new full
screen look,


1585
01:30:53,446 --> 01:30:54,926
really focused on your content.


1586
01:30:55,586 --> 01:30:57,586
If you pull down
or tap at the top,


1587
01:30:57,586 --> 01:30:59,616
you can now get a
smart search field.


1588
01:31:00,546 --> 01:31:04,756
From that search field, you can
get it one tap access to all


1589
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:09,026
of your favorites as well
as do search and access URLs


1590
01:31:09,436 --> 01:31:12,756
and there's a great new
interface for your tabs.


1591
01:31:13,566 --> 01:31:16,496
In addition to all of this,
it has parental controls


1592
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:20,166
and integration with the same
iCloud Keychain you saw earlier


1593
01:31:20,746 --> 01:31:21,506
with Mavericks.


1594
01:31:22,126 --> 01:31:24,896
I'd like to give you
a demo of Safari now.


1595
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:26,916
Let's take a look.


1596
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:31,086
[ Applause ]


1597
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:37,786
OK, head on in to Safari.


1598
01:31:39,106 --> 01:31:40,536
So here we are in Safari.


1599
01:31:40,536 --> 01:31:42,306
I'm going to just
zoom in on this page.


1600
01:31:42,306 --> 01:31:47,406
I want you to watch as I scroll,
all the controls just recede


1601
01:31:47,406 --> 01:31:49,756
and now you have that full
screen for your content.


1602
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:52,626
We've really improved the way
you navigate now in Safari.


1603
01:31:52,626 --> 01:31:56,876
I'm just going to tap in here
to link to a detailed story.


1604
01:31:57,006 --> 01:31:59,446
I mean you can even zoom
in of course on this page.


1605
01:31:59,446 --> 01:32:02,456
And that same gesture you saw
earlier for going back well


1606
01:32:02,456 --> 01:32:04,166
of course that works
in Safari as well.


1607
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:05,956
So I just swiped in from
the edge of the display


1608
01:32:05,956 --> 01:32:08,326
and I can navigate
back and forth


1609
01:32:08,326 --> 01:32:11,526
through my browser
history just like that.


1610
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,126
It's such a fantastic
way to browse.


1611
01:32:15,026 --> 01:32:17,136
Next, let's look at that
unified search field.


1612
01:32:17,136 --> 01:32:18,636
I'm just going to tap
up here at the top.


1613
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:22,066
You see I have one tap
access to all my favorites.


1614
01:32:22,176 --> 01:32:23,786
It's really convenient
but I'm going to type


1615
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:25,846
in this case so I'll type DIS.


1616
01:32:25,846 --> 01:32:30,146
And you notice, I have
a top URL hit as well


1617
01:32:30,146 --> 01:32:33,266
as Google Search suggestions as
well available all right here.


1618
01:32:34,336 --> 01:32:36,236
We've really improved
bookmarking as well.


1619
01:32:36,236 --> 01:32:38,046
I use this bookmark
control down at the bottom.


1620
01:32:38,766 --> 01:32:41,496
I see my bookmark
folders, all my bookmarks.


1621
01:32:41,926 --> 01:32:42,866
We also have shared links.


1622
01:32:42,866 --> 01:32:46,076
You can see stories posted by
people you follow on Twitter.


1623
01:32:46,546 --> 01:32:48,046
And my Reading List.


1624
01:32:48,046 --> 01:32:50,776
And, now, just like you
saw on Mavericks on iOS,


1625
01:32:50,776 --> 01:32:53,276
you can scroll continuously
from article to article


1626
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:54,756
without coming back to the list.


1627
01:32:55,016 --> 01:32:55,876
It's really awesome.


1628
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:59,206
Next, let's take a look at tabs.


1629
01:32:59,626 --> 01:33:05,436
I'm going to click here at the
bottom into tabs, unbelievable,


1630
01:33:05,886 --> 01:33:07,566
and you're no longer
limited to just eight.

[ Applause ]


1632
01:33:14,366 --> 01:33:17,586
And down at the bottom are
also all your iCloud tabs.


1633
01:33:17,586 --> 01:33:21,106
You can see what you left open
on your other devices as well.


1634
01:33:21,106 --> 01:33:25,576
And tabs, they're
really nice to use.


1635
01:33:25,576 --> 01:33:28,556
You can just tap,
sweep into a tab,


1636
01:33:28,746 --> 01:33:32,246
back out, back in, back out.


1637
01:33:32,426 --> 01:33:33,386
It's just fantastic.


1638
01:33:33,386 --> 01:33:35,856
If you want to reorder your
tabs, just tap and hold,


1639
01:33:36,276 --> 01:33:37,556
just rearrange them like this.


1640
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:40,556
And if you're done with
the tab, just swipe it off


1641
01:33:40,556 --> 01:33:42,406
to the side and it goes away.


1642
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:45,186
And that's the new Safari.


1643

[ Applause ]


1644
01:33:52,596 --> 01:33:54,376
Let's take a look now
at Control Center.


1645
01:33:55,846 --> 01:33:58,616
So I'm just going to swipe up
from the bottom of my display


1646
01:33:59,036 --> 01:34:00,456
and up comes Control Center.


1647
01:34:00,926 --> 01:34:03,906
See how these great switches
at the top can turn on and off.


1648
01:34:03,936 --> 01:34:07,516
Do Not Disturb, for instance,
access my brightness,


1649
01:34:07,646 --> 01:34:10,506
you can even access a
flashlight, really useful


1650
01:34:10,506 --> 01:34:13,166
at night, play a song.


1651
01:34:14,706 --> 01:34:17,706
[background music] And of
course this is available


1652
01:34:17,706 --> 01:34:20,086
to me everywhere so if I'm
in Safari for instance.


1653
01:34:21,226 --> 01:34:22,146
Let's bring it up here.


1654
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:24,496
You can turn off that music.


1655
01:34:24,556 --> 01:34:27,276
And you notice how its layering


1656
01:34:27,276 --> 01:34:30,096
and transparency take the
personality, the environment


1657
01:34:30,716 --> 01:34:31,646
where you bring it up.


1658
01:34:33,066 --> 01:34:34,306
That's Control Center.

across all the things
you're doing on your device


1663
01:34:45,876 --> 01:34:47,616
so if I just double click
here on my Home button,


1664
01:34:48,496 --> 01:34:49,756
jump into Multitasking.


1665
01:34:50,116 --> 01:34:52,516
I can just swipe across
everything I have running.


1666
01:34:52,676 --> 01:34:57,186
I want to move into one,
Messages, double tap, back out.


1667
01:34:58,346 --> 01:35:03,356
Move into Mail, back
out, just like this.

01:35:04,216 --> 01:35:05,176
It's really, really nice.


1669

01:35:14,496 --> 01:35:15,656
So of course there's much,


1673
01:35:15,656 --> 01:35:18,976
much more to iOS 7,
including AirDrop.


1674
01:35:19,516 --> 01:35:23,196
[ Applause ]


1675
01:35:23,696 --> 01:35:27,106
AirDrop is absolutely
the easiest way to share


1676
01:35:27,106 --> 01:35:28,706
with the people that
are right around you.


1677
01:35:29,206 --> 01:35:33,376
So now when you're in any app
that supports a Share Sheet,


1678
01:35:33,556 --> 01:35:36,356
you bring up the Share Sheet
and your friends that are all


1679
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:38,636
around you just show
up right there.


1680
01:35:39,646 --> 01:35:44,166
You tap on one and they're
going to get a panel right


1681
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:46,846
on their display and they
can accept what it is


1682
01:35:46,846 --> 01:35:47,616
that you shared.


1683
01:35:48,226 --> 01:35:49,046
They accept it.


1684
01:35:49,216 --> 01:35:51,726
They're taken right into the
app and you know if you want


1685
01:35:51,726 --> 01:35:55,526
to share with multiple people
you just tap, tap, tap.


1686
01:35:55,906 --> 01:35:57,636
No need to wander
around the room,


1687
01:35:57,996 --> 01:35:59,976
bumping your phone or whatever.


1688
01:36:00,516 --> 01:36:08,536
[ Applause ]


1689
01:36:09,036 --> 01:36:11,516
Now, this is system wide for
any app that's supports a Share


1690
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:16,086
Sheet and of course it uses peer
to peer Wi-Fi for maximum speed


1691
01:36:16,386 --> 01:36:19,156
and all your transmissions
are securely encrypted


1692
01:36:19,556 --> 01:36:22,536
because it uses the latest
Wi-Fi hardware, it's supported


1693
01:36:22,536 --> 01:36:25,576
on the iPhone 5, the
fourth-generation iPad,


1694
01:36:26,126 --> 01:36:29,326
iPad mini and the
fifth-generation iPod Touch


1695
01:36:30,186 --> 01:36:32,166
and that is AirDrop.


1696
01:36:32,596 --> 01:36:34,146
Next, let's talk
about the camera.


1697
01:36:35,216 --> 01:36:38,816
So, now, your camera in iOS
7 is four cameras in one.


1698
01:36:39,186 --> 01:36:42,546
You just swipe from your video
camera to your photo camera,


1699
01:36:43,596 --> 01:36:46,956
to your square cropped
camera, to your pano camera.


1700
01:36:47,566 --> 01:36:50,246
And when you're taking
stills, you now have access


1701
01:36:50,736 --> 01:36:54,556
to live photo filters from
some gorgeous black and whites,


1702
01:36:54,986 --> 01:36:58,106
to some classic color
filters as well.


1703
01:36:58,256 --> 01:36:59,686
So with your great,
new camera we want


1704
01:36:59,686 --> 01:37:02,256
to give you a great new
way to manage your photos


1705
01:37:02,256 --> 01:37:03,876
and it's the new Photos app.


1706
01:37:04,706 --> 01:37:08,406
You know for many users this is
what their photo organization


1707
01:37:08,566 --> 01:37:10,436
looks like: an endless,


1708
01:37:10,436 --> 01:37:12,946
unorganized stream
of their camera roll.


1709
01:37:12,946 --> 01:37:14,406
We've all been there
but, you know,


1710
01:37:14,406 --> 01:37:15,966
it doesn't have to be this way.


1711
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,926
There's great information
in those photos.


1712
01:37:19,926 --> 01:37:22,926
iOS knows where you took the
photos and when you took them


1713
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:26,186
and that provides inherent
structure that we can use


1714
01:37:26,186 --> 01:37:27,746
to organize those photos.


1715
01:37:27,896 --> 01:37:31,036
And now in photos
in iOS 7, we do.


1716
01:37:31,406 --> 01:37:33,036
We organize them into moments.


1717
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,276
And I'd like to give you
a demo of that right now.


1718
01:37:36,516 --> 01:37:41,936
[ Applause ]


1719
01:37:42,436 --> 01:37:44,136
So let's take a look
now at the Photos app.


1720
01:37:45,766 --> 01:37:49,916
So here you see some photos
that were taken in San Francisco


1721
01:37:49,916 --> 01:37:53,896
and you see nothing was done to
organize these photos explicitly


1722
01:37:53,896 --> 01:37:54,816
and yet they have these labels.


1723
01:37:54,816 --> 01:37:56,416
It's like the Palace
of Fine Arts,


1724
01:37:57,426 --> 01:37:59,716
Baker Beach, Lombard Street.


1725
01:37:59,716 --> 01:38:01,556
It provides this
natural organization


1726
01:38:01,556 --> 01:38:02,916
for appreciating the photos.


1727
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:05,986
We can go up that more trips
at more times in San Francisco,


1728
01:38:05,986 --> 01:38:08,526
Golden Gate, to San
Francisco Fisherman's Wharf.


1729
01:38:08,796 --> 01:38:10,496
But then you see we have home.


1730
01:38:10,576 --> 01:38:12,856
We have photos taken at
home and photos taken


1731
01:38:12,856 --> 01:38:15,576
at the elementary school
and around that area.


1732
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:19,246
And now if you want to
zoom back out to get a--


1733
01:38:19,246 --> 01:38:21,146
more of bird's eye view
of your collection,


1734
01:38:21,556 --> 01:38:23,696
we draw these moments
intelligently together


1735
01:38:23,696 --> 01:38:24,466
into collections.


1736
01:38:25,746 --> 01:38:27,816
So see here how that
multiple day trip


1737
01:38:27,816 --> 01:38:30,556
around San Francisco is
collected-- sorry about that,


1738
01:38:30,556 --> 01:38:32,466
I've got a little
excited there, into--


1739
01:38:32,466 --> 01:38:34,756
it's a very exciting interface


1740
01:38:34,756 --> 01:38:38,396
into a multi-day trip
in San Francisco.


1741
01:38:38,516 --> 01:38:40,936
And that time at home and
around the school, well,


1742
01:38:40,936 --> 01:38:44,026
that's one moment-- that's
one collection as well.


1743
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:46,226
It's a really great way
to browse your photos.


1744
01:38:46,566 --> 01:38:50,316
You can even go all the
way out to the year level.


1745
01:38:51,716 --> 01:38:53,696
Look across your whole
photo collection.


1746
01:38:54,516 --> 01:39:00,776
[ Applause ]


1747
01:39:01,276 --> 01:39:04,196
And look how we pull out the
interesting places that you went


1748
01:39:04,196 --> 01:39:08,966
in that year like 2011 was
Colorado and Hawaii, 2012,


1749
01:39:09,266 --> 01:39:10,346
went to South America.


1750
01:39:10,346 --> 01:39:11,666
You may not remember
when you did it


1751
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:13,946
but iOS does and
it's right there.


1752
01:39:14,736 --> 01:39:18,456
And, you know, with this retina
display you can even can make


1753
01:39:18,456 --> 01:39:20,516
out patterns of photos in
one different occasions


1754
01:39:20,516 --> 01:39:22,736
or in a course we found like
we had the urge that we wanted


1755
01:39:22,736 --> 01:39:24,206
to just tap in right from here.


1756
01:39:24,516 --> 01:39:26,576
And so now in fact you can.


1757
01:39:27,116 --> 01:39:28,776
You can just tap and scrub


1758
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:32,356
and find the photo you're
looking for just like that.


1759
01:39:32,356 --> 01:39:33,876
It's really just amazing.


1760
01:39:33,876 --> 01:39:36,866
So I can just pick a photo
here whichever one I want.


1761
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,876
It's kind of cute and
now we can edit it


1762
01:39:39,876 --> 01:39:41,106
because we have photo filters.


1763
01:39:41,106 --> 01:39:42,506
So I can go into
the filters here,


1764
01:39:42,886 --> 01:39:47,086
I can try different color
effects, and if I find one I


1765
01:39:47,086 --> 01:39:49,036
like maybe a nice
black and white,


1766
01:39:49,036 --> 01:39:50,496
you can do it just like that.


1767
01:39:50,726 --> 01:39:52,586
I'll apply it and
save that photo away.


1768
01:39:53,266 --> 01:39:54,316
We also have great new ways


1769
01:39:54,356 --> 01:39:56,486
to share your photos
in the Photos apps.


1770
01:39:56,486 --> 01:39:56,976
Let's bring up sharing.


1771
01:39:58,436 --> 01:40:01,626
We have AirDrop right here if
any of you were running iOS 7,


1772
01:40:01,626 --> 01:40:03,076
I'd see you, it looks
like it didn't leak,


1773
01:40:03,076 --> 01:40:03,876
so that's good you're not


1774
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:06,416
in there right now,
but you have AirDrop.


1775
01:40:06,546 --> 01:40:08,776
You have access to other
photos, you can share them


1776
01:40:08,776 --> 01:40:10,826
from right here,
just really handy.


1777
01:40:11,456 --> 01:40:14,056
Great photo sharing option
is iCloud photo sharing,


1778
01:40:14,056 --> 01:40:15,196
I'm going to tap on that now.


1779
01:40:15,366 --> 01:40:16,676
It's going to iCloud
photo sharing.


1780
01:40:17,196 --> 01:40:19,686
And from here, I can
select the Photo Streams


1781
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:20,786
that I want to share too.


1782
01:40:21,066 --> 01:40:23,376
So I'm on family photos now,
but I'm going to drill in


1783
01:40:23,816 --> 01:40:26,506
and I can see other Photo
Streams I've set up.


1784
01:40:26,506 --> 01:40:30,536
And now, other people can share
into my Photo Stream as well.


1785
01:40:30,536 --> 01:40:31,796
So these are shared
Photo Streams.

[ Applause ]


1787
01:40:37,416 --> 01:40:42,506
I'll just select a Photo Stream
here and type a little message.


1788
01:40:43,796 --> 01:40:44,726
We'll post that photo.


1789
01:40:44,726 --> 01:40:46,826
So it made it really
easy to share


1790
01:40:46,966 --> 01:40:49,016
and we've also made it a
really great experience


1791
01:40:49,366 --> 01:40:51,636
to experience the photos
you and others have shared


1792
01:40:51,636 --> 01:40:53,146
with this new shared
tab at the bottom.


1793
01:40:53,146 --> 01:40:54,246
So I'm going to go in here.


1794
01:40:54,246 --> 01:40:56,346
I could see my photo
with a comment.


1795
01:40:56,646 --> 01:40:58,606
I can see the comments
of other people


1796
01:40:58,606 --> 01:41:00,226
and the photos that
they've shared.


1797
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:06,086
And now, we even support sharing
video via iCloud photo sharing.


1798
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:11,836
And we have a great way to just
browse those shared photos.


1799
01:41:11,836 --> 01:41:13,606
I'll just tilt the
device into landscape.


1800
01:41:14,076 --> 01:41:15,546
I can scroll through
it like this.


1801
01:41:16,666 --> 01:41:18,466
And just look how
beautiful that is.


1802
01:41:18,846 --> 01:41:20,776
What a great way to
experience your photos.


1803
01:41:20,956 --> 01:41:24,136
So that's the new
photos App in iOS 7.

[ Applause ]


1805
01:41:32,886 --> 01:41:35,826
So integration with internet
services is a huge part


1806
01:41:35,826 --> 01:41:40,716
of the experience of iOS and
never more so than in iOS 7.


1807
01:41:41,196 --> 01:41:43,246
So to take you through
some of those features,


1808
01:41:43,346 --> 01:41:45,216
I'd like to bring up Eddy Cue.


1809
01:41:45,736 --> 01:41:46,166

>> Thank you.


1812
01:41:52,836 --> 01:41:54,026
>> Thanks, it's great
to be here.


1813
01:41:54,746 --> 01:41:56,146
So let's talk about Siri.


1814
01:41:56,636 --> 01:42:00,706
The first thing is Siri has
a gorgeous new interface.


1815
01:42:01,236 --> 01:42:04,706
Now as I speak, you'll see a
sound wave across the bottom


1816
01:42:05,816 --> 01:42:08,916
and you get the result to a
beautiful, gorgeous, clean way.


1817
01:42:09,986 --> 01:42:13,776
But Siri is always been a lot
about your-- the voice of Siri.


1818
01:42:13,776 --> 01:42:15,416
And we've got an all new voice.


1819
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:16,306
>> Hi, Eddy.


1820
01:42:16,936 --> 01:42:17,846
What can I do for you?


1821
01:42:18,326 --> 01:42:20,556
>> And you can also
choose a male voice.


1822
01:42:21,376 --> 01:42:21,856
>> Hi, Eddy.


1823
01:42:22,166 --> 01:42:23,016
What can I do for you?


1824
01:42:23,906 --> 01:42:25,986
>> And we've got high
quality-- thank you.


1825
01:42:27,246 --> 01:42:29,326
We've also got high
quality female


1826
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:31,806
and male voices for French.

[Foreign Language]


1828
01:42:35,046 --> 01:42:35,826

And we're going


1830
01:42:38,016 --> 01:42:39,836
to be adding other
languages over time.


1831
01:42:40,236 --> 01:42:43,486
Now Siri is also getting a
lot smarter and knows how


1832
01:42:43,486 --> 01:42:44,966
to control more of your device.


1833
01:42:44,966 --> 01:42:50,046
So you could say, play my last
voice mail or turn on Bluetooth


1834
01:42:50,766 --> 01:42:52,156
or increase my brightness.

[ Applause ]


1836
01:42:59,406 --> 01:43:01,956

lot more questions


1837
01:43:02,396 --> 01:43:05,816
because we've integrated some
new services like Twitter,


1838
01:43:05,816 --> 01:43:08,916
so you can see what people are
saying or what's happening.


1839
01:43:09,806 --> 01:43:12,616
We've integrated the
world's largest Encyclopedia


1840
01:43:12,706 --> 01:43:13,626
and Wikipedia.


1841
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:17,576
And we've even integrated
web search results


1842
01:43:17,576 --> 01:43:19,736
from Bing right inside of Siri.


1843
01:43:20,726 --> 01:43:22,446
And it's great for photos too.


1844
01:43:24,006 --> 01:43:27,936
And that is some of the new
features of Siri in iOS 7.


1845
01:43:29,076 --> 01:43:31,586
Now Siri is also a big
part of our next feature.

sold today have integrated music

from an iOS device,


1850
01:43:48,006 --> 01:43:50,456
but we want to take
this integration


1851
01:43:50,456 --> 01:43:52,156
to a whole another level.


1852
01:43:53,496 --> 01:43:57,736
What if you could get iOS
on the screen that is built


1853

into your car so that you can
make phone calls, play music,

or Eyes Free using Siri.


1856
01:44:10,056 --> 01:44:12,326
So now, when you
make a phone call,


1857
01:44:12,326 --> 01:44:15,206
it's going to look something
like this, call John Appleseed,

or play get lucky, or go
to maps, get directions,

Now, all of these car
manufacturers are introducing

iOS integration in 2014 and I
know which one I want to buy.


1864
01:44:51,876 --> 01:44:53,486
And that's iOS in the car.


1865
01:44:54,136 --> 01:44:55,886
Next, the App Store.


1866
01:44:57,036 --> 01:44:58,796
Now the App Store
looks beautiful.


1867
01:44:59,556 --> 01:45:02,416
It's way easier to find
Apps than ever before.


1868
01:45:02,576 --> 01:45:06,166
We've added a new feature where
you can look for apps based

Or I'm in Union Square Shopping.

It's that easy to
discover new apps.

It's really great.

you're all going to love

because everyday, you
see something like this.

The music app in iOS

the best music player
we have ever done.

The first thing you'll
notice is we provide you

with beautiful artist images
right in your library.

way to listen to your music.

always modify the station,

I could say play more songs

song, or add it to my wish list.

some more songs like this.

it's just lost in the couch

to turn off Find My iPhone

don't know your iPod user

at Apple that worked

01:55:35,836 --> 01:55:37,576
so hard to create them.


2040

I'd like to close this morning
with the reminder, that our goal


2045
01:56:03,396 --> 01:56:06,596
at Apple is to make
amazing products


2046
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:10,836
that our customers love,
really great products


2047
01:56:11,346 --> 01:56:13,826
that enrich people's lives.


2048
01:56:14,496 --> 01:56:18,716
The words you saw at the
beginning of the show are more


2049
01:56:18,716 --> 01:56:20,096
than just words to us.


2050
01:56:20,986 --> 01:56:22,816
They are the values we lived by.


2051
01:56:23,656 --> 01:56:24,706
They drive us.


2052
01:56:25,726 --> 01:56:30,506
You see them reflected in our
products over the years and just


2053
01:56:30,506 --> 01:56:32,276
as much in the products
this morning.


2054
01:56:32,276 --> 01:56:35,626
And you'll just continue
to see these reflected


2055
01:56:35,966 --> 01:56:40,216
in the products we
do in the future.


2056
01:56:41,316 --> 01:56:47,726
We've created an ad to help us
express just how deeply we feel


2057
01:56:47,726 --> 01:56:54,976
about this and I'd like
to share it with you now.

This is what matters.

The experience of a product.


2061
01:57:09,046 --> 01:57:11,106
How will it make someone feel?


2062
01:57:11,266 --> 01:57:19,236
Will it make life better?


2063
01:57:19,236 --> 01:57:26,926
Does it deserve to exist?


2064
01:57:26,926 --> 01:57:30,926
We spend a lot of time
on a few great things


2065
01:57:30,926 --> 01:57:41,836
until every idea we touch
enhances each life it touches.


2066
01:57:41,836 --> 01:57:48,856
You may rarely look at it,
but you'll always feel it.


2067
01:57:48,856 --> 01:57:49,796
This is our signature.


2068
