I'm also not going to teach you

how to become a sound designer,

but I hope I'm going to give you


27
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:16,656
some ideas of how to incorporate


28
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:19,226
sound in your design process and


29
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,456
why it makes sense to do so.


30
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,466
Now, as a developer, you have a


31
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:24,906
lot on your plate and adding


32
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:26,486
sound to your app is probably


33
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,446
not super high on your to-do

case that sound, if used the


36

attention to, how it works.


130
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:43,136

135
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:53,096

00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,106
Now, before, when we were in the


194
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,536
forest, we heard the Dark Sky


195
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,026
notification, and Dark Sky is a


196
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:53,226
weather app, and it sends this


197
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:54,936
notification when rain is


198
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:55,426
imminent.


199
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:57,986
It does this pretty well.


200
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:59,096
Let's listen to it again.


201
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,976
And why does this work so well?


202
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,330
[beeping].


203
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:06,236
This sound is easily


204
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,066
recognizable.


205
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,756
When you hear this, you know


206
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,246
it's coming from Dark Sky.


207
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,806
It conveys a message.


208
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:14,566
It's not a direct recording of


209
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,056
raindrops, but it has this


210
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:17,366
liquid quality to it.


211
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,056
It helps you connect the sound


212
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:21,186
to the message it's sending.


213
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:24,366
It's a friendly sound.


214
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,296
It's not jarring, but telling


215
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,156
you in a friendly way it's time


216
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:29,086
to find cover soon.


217
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,966
And it's a simple and clean


218
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,746
sound, quite pleasant to listen


219
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:38,135
to as well.


220
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,126
So let's try this ourselves.


221
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:41,525
Let's create a sound for an app.


222
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,285
Shall we? Well, first we need an


223
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:44,876
app, of course.


224
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,936
Well, luckily, some years ago,


225
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:50,106
our prototyping team did a


226
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:50,606
session.


227
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,536
It was called "Fake It Till You


228
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:52,906
Make It."


229
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:54,586
It was about creating fake apps


230
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,086
in order to learn from how


231
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,246
people would interact with them.


232
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:59,546
They create an app called Toast


233
00:08:59,546 --> 00:08:59,976
Modern.


234
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,156
Now, maybe some of you know that


235
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:05,596
toast has become very popular in


236
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:07,916
San Francisco, and people pay a


237
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,146
lot of money for a slice of what


238
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,766
some call hipster toast.


239
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,176
Toast Modern, the app they


240
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,346
created, helps you find


241
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,126
overpriced artisanal toast on


242
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:22,256
the streets of San Francisco


243
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,416
[laughter] and share this with


244
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,386
your friends and family.


245
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:33,176
Now if someone sends you some


246
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:34,626
newly discovered toast, you get


247
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:35,396
a notification.


248
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,966
So we can create a sound for


249
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:37,786
this notification.


250
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:38,986
Let's do that.


251
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:41,926
We can start by asking ourselves


252
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,836
some questions, like, "What is


253
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:45,396
the essence of what this app is


254
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:45,736
about?"


255
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,546
Well, in this case, simple.


256
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,246
It's about finding toast and


257
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,696
sharing it with your friends.


258
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,636
What emotion do we want to evoke


259
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,896
here when people receive this


260
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:56,686
notification?


261
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,566
Well, we want them to be happy


262
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,966
they found some new toast to try


263
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,496
and eager to try it out.


264
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:05,246
How do we match the app's


265
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:05,986
aesthetics?


266
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:09,626
We just saw the screen, and it


267
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,016
looks pretty functional and


268
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,776
simple, so let's keep the sound


269
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,616
similar to that, keep it simple


270
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,276
and to the point.


271
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:19,626
And if we notice, we can start


272
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,796
with some sound sources.


273
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,516
We can record some sounds to be


274
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:24,326
inspired by.


275
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,386
In this case, let's just get


276
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:26,846
some bread.


277
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:29,216
Let's get a toaster and record


278
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:29,756
those sounds.


279
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,976
So that's exactly what we did,


280
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:33,976
and here are some of the sounds


281
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:34,546
we recorded.


282
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:37,486
[ Toaster popping ]


283
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:39,126
Toaster ejecting toast.


284
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,526
Spreading butter on a piece of


285
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:43,936
toast.


286
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:47,036
[ Bread Crumbling ]


287
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:48,856
The sound of toast breaking.


288
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:52,656
And taking a bite out of a piece


289
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:53,016
of toast.


290
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,076
Now we can also create a little


291
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,026
bit of a story from the


292
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:57,606
beginning to the end, you know,


293
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,566
making toast and eating toast,


294
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:00,660
and record the whole process.


295
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:03,016
[toaster popping].


296
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:04,676
[timer ticking].


297
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:07,516
[chiming].


298
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,016
[scraping toast].


299
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,436
[toast crunching].


300
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:12,856
[laughter].


301
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,706
Okay, now we have a nice


302
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:16,416
palette.


303
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,226
You notice we added some sounds


304
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:20,286
to this, because in the initial


305
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,916
set, there was not that timer


306
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,236
sound and the chime sounds, so


307
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,276
we recorded those two.


308
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,346
And now we can start making


309
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:29,576
notification sounds.


310
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,366
There's one sound that I like


311
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,596
quite a bit.


312
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:33,786
[toast crunching].


313
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:34,636
It's a great sound.


314
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:35,936
It's very characteristic, but


315
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,466
maybe it doesn't work so well as


316
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,646
a notification coming from your


317
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:40,676
phone every day, right?


318
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,076
It's a little harsh.


319
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,446
So how about this one?


320
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:46,356
[timer ticking].


321
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,266
[chiming].


322
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,676
There's this little timer sound


323
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,706
and then the chime, but the only


324
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:51,846
thing I don't really like about


325
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:53,756
it is the sound of the toaster


326
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:54,716
ejecting the toast.


327
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:55,500
It's a little harsh.


328
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:58,616
So we can find a more expensive


329
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,266
toaster maybe, that'll sound


330
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,856
better, or we can construct our


331
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,266
own toaster sound.


332
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,846
But why don't we just take away


333
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:07,806
the parts we don't like and see


334
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:08,330
what we're left with?


335
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:12,976
So let's take that sound out.


336
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:13,043
[timer ticking].


337
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:13,110
[chiming].


338
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,656
Actually, this might work pretty


339
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:16,036
well.


340
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,266
Let's see what it looks like


341
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,000
when the notification comes in.


342
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,016
[timer ticking].


343
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,766
[chiming].


344
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,896
I think this is pretty good for


345
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:26,086
now.


346
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,056
Now remember, we're just trying


347
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:28,536
things out.


348
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,386
We're just prototyping.


349
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:31,886
Even the app is fake.


350
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,786
So, you know, we're not all


351
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:36,606
sound designers, but once we


352
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:38,076
start working with a sound


353
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:39,016
designer, they can take this


354
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,846
inspiration and maybe create


355
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:42,776
something that's more unique,


356
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,746
more ownable, and maybe more


357
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:46,226
abstract, like the Dark Sky


358
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,000
notification.


359
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:51,956
Now what did the creative


360
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,346
process look like here?


361
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,566
We started out with all these


362
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:56,706
toast recordings.


363
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,646
Those are the blue dots.


364
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:59,336
And then we realized we needed


365
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,706
some other sounds to complete


366
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,236
the palette, so we added the


367
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:03,816
timer sound and the chime sound.


368
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,826
Those are the yellow ones.


369
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,136
And then we created some


370
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,006
candidates and tried them out on


371
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:09,816
our device.


372
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,326
We found out that a lot of these


373
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,566
sounds didn't really work so


374
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,156
well, so we ended up with the


375
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:18,416
timer and the chime sound.


376
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:21,506
Now why am I showing you this?


377
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:24,206
Because it illustrates how often


378
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,076
we start out with this


379
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,446
assumption that something might


380
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,836
work, but then we find out that,


381
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,876
going this exploration phase, we


382
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,586
find out that what we really


383
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:33,936
need is something different.


384
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,806
We have to go through this to


385
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:36,976
understand that.


386
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:38,956
First we have to make mistakes


387
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,276
to come up with something great.


388
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:44,986
Now what kind of sound sources


389
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,486
can you record when you do an


390
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:49,006
exploration like this?


391
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,666
You could record an acoustic


392
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,216
instrument or an electronic


393
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,816
instrument, like a synthesizer


394
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:57,026
software or hardware.


395
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,736
But really, we found out you can


396
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:00,536
record anything.


397
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,696
Anything that makes a sound can


398
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,276
be an inspiration.


399
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:11,726
Now at Apple, we use any of


400
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,826
these sound sources.


401
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:16,666
It really depends on the project


402
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,356
we're working on, and some of


403
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:20,886
them are easily recognizable


404
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:21,516
instruments.


405
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:24,786
These sounds may be played


406
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,676
millions of times per day.


407
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,216
Earlier this year, Tim mentioned


408
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,816
that at one point during the


409
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,066
Super Bowl, 380,000 messages

00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,646

the sound has it been played

live on stage.


414
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,186

that.

this sound since it was

00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:04,456
introduced with iOS 7.

I hope I hit the right one.

00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,516
Thank you very much.


428
00:15:38,986 --> 00:15:40,886
We use this notification sound


429
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,656
for messages.


430
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:44,146
Why does this work well for

00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:44,806
messages?


432
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,326
We have to think about, when


433
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,196
will people hear this sound, and


434
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:50,406
what will they be doing?


435
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:51,966
They have their phones in a


436
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:54,066
pocket, in their jacket.


437
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:56,226
Maybe they are on a busy city


438
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:57,826
street or an airport.


439
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,706
So we have to cut through the


440
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,126
noise of these locations.


441
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:04,286
It needs to be very clean and


442
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:06,476
simple, but there's another


443
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:08,886
thing that is important that we


444
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,966
don't really want to, you know,


445
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:15,556
convey the information of what

00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:15,986
you're sending.


447
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:17,406
It's very different than the


448
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:18,676

00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:21,986
In this case, it can mean

anything, anything you're


453
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:23,786
sending with it.


454
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,236
So we want it to be very neutral

[ Laughter ]


465
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,866
So we recorded this sound as the

467
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:01,156

469
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,156
Absolutely.


470
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:09,236
It's a little bit more of a


471
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,996
characteristic sound, because


472
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:11,766
it's not a very common


473
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:13,006
instrument, but again, it's very


474
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,576
simple and clear as well.


475
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:18,346
Now when we were designing for


476
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:20,695
the watch, we asked our self the


477
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:22,165
question, how can we be inspired


478
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,715
by this beautiful industrial


479
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:24,846
design of this device?


480
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:27,675
And how can we create the


481
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:30,226
illusion that what you hear,


482
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,586
that the sounds are actually


483
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:35,806
made by the device itself, that


484
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,756
they're coming from the device


485
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,176
itself?


486
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:40,446
So we decided to record the


487
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,226
different materials, the


488
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:43,596
stainless steel, the aluminum,


489
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,086
and the gold.


490
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:46,806
And what I have here is the


491
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,806
housing of a stainless steel


492

493
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,656
Now we can hit that in different


494
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,036
ways and see if it makes a

little deeper, there's always

538
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,176
So to recap, what are the


539
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:24,246
characteristics of a good

541
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:28,336
It's distinguishable.

00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,046
You know which app is sending


543
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:31,536
the sound.


544
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,196
It matches the design of the

app.


546
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,086
So you're creating an app that


547
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:38,166
looks very cartoony, let's say.


548
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,766
You may want to look at some


549
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,726
sounds that really match that


550
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:42,266
aesthetic.


551
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:43,826
Or if your app is very


552
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:46,046
minimalist, then maybe you want


553
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,066
to start with some very simple

555
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:51,056
It's unobtrusive and repeatable.


556
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,716
This means that even if you use


557
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:55,726
it multiple times per day that


558
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:56,846
it doesn't become annoying.


559
00:19:58,136 --> 00:19:59,556
A great way to try this out is


560
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,216
just to put it on your phone for


561
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,216
a little while, for a week or


562
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:03,886
so, and live with it for a

00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:03,976
while.


564
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,506
If after a week you still like


565
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,156
the sound, it's probably a


566
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:08,906
pretty good one.


567
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:11,256
And then it's clear.


568
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:12,466
It's clean.


569
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,366
It cuts through noise, but it's


570
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,016
not abrasive.


571
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:20,136
All right.

00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,346
Now every object you interact


575
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,636
with in the real world makes a


576
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:42,826
sound, so it's very natural to


577
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,606
expect that an object you


578
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:45,846
interact with on the screen


579
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:48,146
makes a sound as well, but we


580
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,816
definitely don't do this for


581
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:50,566
every interaction.


582
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,436
We really try to find the right


583
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,716
balance between no sound and too


584
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:56,116
much.


585
00:20:58,296 --> 00:20:59,886
So UI sounds are things like


586
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:03,306
keyboard sounds, scrolling


587
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,316
sounds, pressing a button,


588
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:09,076
tapping, swiping, or any kind of


589
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:09,996
transitions.


590
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,826
Now I want to focus on three of


591
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:14,506
these and see how we approach


592
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,816
them in our own devices.


593
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:18,406
Let's start with the keyboard


594
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:19,546
sound.


595
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,376
Now following our previous


596
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:25,006
design strategy, we may want to


597
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:26,406
start by recording some actual


598
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:27,866
keyboards, like an old


599
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:28,366
typewriter.


600
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:35,566
[ Typewriter clicking ]


601
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,606
Now, this rattles quite a bit,


602
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:39,336
but there's something satisfying


603
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:40,626
about the letters hitting the


604
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:40,996
paper.


605
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:42,736
So let's remember that.


606
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:45,286
How about a computer keyboard?

[ Typing sounds ]


608
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:53,276
There's something pleasant about


609
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,346
this sound as well.


610
00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:55,526
It's not very static.


611
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:56,896
It's very lively.


612
00:21:57,476 --> 00:21:58,746
So not every key sounds the


613
00:21:58,746 --> 00:21:59,206
same.


614
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:01,366
So we can remember this when we


615
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,816
create our own sound for our iOS


616
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:04,286

617
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:07,006
We're designing for software, so


618
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,806
we can make it sound any way we


619
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:09,156
want.


620
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:11,696
For instance, we can change the


621
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:14,306
sound of the space bar, of the


622
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,006

[ Popping sounds ]


626
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,536
So we create a character that is


627
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:36,086
a bit more playful and not so


628
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:36,636

629
00:22:37,596 --> 00:22:39,186
And we do another thing.


630
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:41,226
When you type faster, we bring


631
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,686
down the volume of the sound


632

ever so slightly.


633
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:46,176
It's not something that you may


634
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:48,256
hear in everyday use, but even


635
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:50,066
these little things make a


636
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,616
difference in the experience.


637
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:53,416

642
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:14,906
For those of you with an iPhone


643
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:17,636

644
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:18,376

Go ahead.

What does it sound like?


648
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,256
Now since the iPhone 7, we have


649
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,716
a solid, safe Home button.


650
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:31,506
It's durable, and it's


651
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:32,766
waterproof, but it doesn't


652
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,286
actually move or make a "click"

sound.


654
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:38,296
So we used the Taptic Engine to


655
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:40,426
create this button experience,


656
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,816
and we learned while designing


657
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:45,016
for the watch that combining


658
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,196
sounds and haptics the right way


659
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:48,716
and synchronizing them


660
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:50,416
precisely, we can come up with


661
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,746
this great multisensory


662
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:54,276

663
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:55,386
for a similar experience for


664
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:58,416
this button, so we decided to


665
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,656
add a very subtle, quiet "click"


666
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,756
sound to the tap of the Taptic


667
00:24:02,756 --> 00:24:04,596

it.


670
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:09,196
And this also allowed us to

00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:11,326
create multiple "click" fields.

00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:18,966
There's one more thing that was


676
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:20,686
very interesting when we were

679
00:24:24,386 --> 00:24:27,396
one haptic tap, and you


680
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:28,846
synthesize it to a very sharp


681
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:30,696
and precise sound, like the one


682
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,496
on the left here.


683

feel is very precise and sharp


687
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,566
as well, but if we take exactly


688
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:43,196
the same tap, exactly the same,


689
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:45,156
we didn't change anything, and


690
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:47,526
synchronize it to another sound


691
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,076
like this [sound], then people


692
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:51,486
think that what they feel is


693
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:52,286
very different.

So it's really interesting how


697
00:24:56,586 --> 00:24:58,526
we can fool ourselves using

701
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:06,286

713
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,036

to that of an object passing you


716
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,626

718
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,196
We could have used another sound

00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:42,516
with similar characteristics,


720
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:44,446
but you really also want it to


721
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:46,936
match the aesthetic of the Apple

723
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:50,636

00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:07,226
these questions.

00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,166
lot of sense to think about


766
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,406

00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:18,506

770
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,486
Well, if the answer to the first


771

question is yes, and you do


772
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,026

773
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:28,146
already playing a role.

778
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,796

Of course, you don't have to use

790
00:27:58,216 --> 00:27:59,826

Now, of course, if you're

Now if you do add UI sounds,


820

in, the music ducks, which is


842
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:54,886
fine because I choose to get

But if your notification sound


846

00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:31,816
Now when you're done exploring


956
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,736
and done prototyping, maybe it's


957
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:35,976
time to work with an expert.


958
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:37,636
It's time to get serious.


959
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:40,716
So a sound designer can help you


960
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:42,206
come with an overall sound


961
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:44,346
concept and help you design the


962
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:46,856
sounds, and a sound engineer can


963
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:48,296
help you clean these sounds up


964
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,476
and make them ready for everyday


965
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:50,956
use.


966
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:56,606
Now we all know this guy, and


967
00:33:56,946 --> 00:33:58,966
even I have to admit I use it


968
00:33:58,966 --> 00:33:59,436
now and then.


969
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,436
Our goal is not for everyone to


970
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:05,916
leave their sound on all the


971
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,066
time, everywhere they go.


972
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:11,016
But when we start hearing more


973
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,696
and more wonderful notifications


974
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:16,416
and UI sounds that help our


975
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,045
users and delight our users,


976
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:23,206
then maybe, just maybe, you'll


977
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:24,616
start seeing people reach for it


978
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:26,666
a little less.


979
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:28,856
That will be awesome.


980
00:34:28,856 --> 00:34:30,775
Thanks for listening to me


981
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:30,976
today.
