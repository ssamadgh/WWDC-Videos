00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,916
Welcome to Prototyping.

00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:19,516
I'm Jeff Bernstein.


4
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:22,496
I brought along Linda

and Mark Hauenstein
from the team.

00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:26,346
So who is this session
for today?


7
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:29,026
Well, it's for developers
at companies.

9
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:32,286
Excellent.

00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:33,456
To be expected.

00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:37,196
All right.


13
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,386
People who don't
code at all, anyone?


14
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:42,936
All right, great.


15
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:43,976

And designers, designers?


18
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:50,746
Yeah, all right.


19
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,166
And management types?

Sort out you guys, yeah.


22
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:05,706
So our plan today: We're going
to design and prototype an app.


23
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:08,366
We're going to go through
the steps we would go


24
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:09,556
through to try something out.


25
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:12,276
And we're going to
show a variety


26
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:13,776
of different prototyping
methods.


27
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:17,186
All of this is going
to be with a focus


28
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:21,246
on prototyping an experience,
not trying out an API or testing


29
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:23,036
out some kind of
technical feasibility.


30
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:26,206
So who are we?


31
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:29,736
Who are we to come here and
tell you how to make your apps?


32
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:32,506
Oh we're a small
secret team at Apple.


33
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:34,936
We work across all
of Apple's products.


34
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:39,066
We explore what new
interfaces mean to our devices,

operating system
and applications.


36
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,186
And we do this by making
interactive prototypes every


37
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:51,066
day, sometimes 24 hours a day.


38
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,146
So today, you're all very lucky.

00:01:54,716 --> 00:02:01,416

you today a world-changing,

None of this is real.


59
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:13,656
It's just a prototype.


60
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:17,776
So why? Why would
we go to the trouble


61
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:21,556
of creating this
beautiful, world-changing,


62
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:25,846
disruptive application
that is completely fake?


63
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,126
Well, this is the picture
in most people's head.


64
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,906
I have an idea.


65
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:42,006
Then, I build my application,
and then, step three, profit.


66
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:49,326
Except, what I see frequently
is that people have an idea,


67
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:51,526
they build their application,


68
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:55,226
and somehow they're
disappointed by the result.


69
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:59,506
Maybe the experience isn't
what you've hoped for.


70
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:02,126
Maybe it just doesn't
resonate with your customers.


71
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,596
And building applications
are difficult.


72
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:05,566
You guys know this.


73
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:07,246
It takes time.


74
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:14,576
It takes money, people,
sleep, heartache.


75
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,656
And frankly, it's
a lot of typing.


76
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:19,986
So, that's a lot of
work for something


77
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,386
that you're not happy
with in the end.


78
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,156
So instead of going
from an idea directly


79
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:33,136
to building your application,
we're going to go from an idea


80
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,846
to a prototype, and then
build our application.


81
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:40,476
And it's best if we can do
that over and over again.


82
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:43,366
The more prototypes we
can put between our idea


83
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:47,616
and our application, the better
the result is going to be.


84
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:51,636
And the way that we do this is
by beginning with something fake


85
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:54,476
and then gradually
adding elements


86
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:56,426
that are more real
along the way,


87
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,346
sprinkling it with
interactivity.


88
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:01,956
So there are two
important reasons


89
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:04,866
to prototype I want everybody to
keep in mind throughout today.


90
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:09,686
Number one is to test
ideas, to save time


91
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,326
and money building the right
things for your application.


92
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:17,636
And number two is to get new
ideas, to make the experience


93
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:22,206
of your app even
better in the end.


94
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:23,926
So how do we do this?


95
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,826
It's actually really simple.


96
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:34,066
Make fake apps, show people
and learn from their feedback.


97
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:41,126
Again, make fake
apps, show people


98
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:44,076
and learn from their feedback.


99
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:49,236
Do that over, and over, and
over again until the experience


100
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:50,526
of your app feels great.


101
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:55,046
So how do we make fake apps?


102
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:55,726
What does that mean?


103
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:59,536
Well, we want to ask ourselves
three questions before we begin.


104
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:03,266
The first one is what
needs to be more real?


105
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:05,136
Everything else is
going to be fake,


106
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,156
but what one element
are we trying


107
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:09,446
to explore and get feedback on?


108
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:12,676
The second question
is what can we fake?


109
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,106
And that's everything else.


110
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,716
Everything else will pretty
much just be a picture.


111
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:21,776
The third important question
is where will they use it?


112
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:24,786
We want to make sure that
if we're making a prototype,


113
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:29,416
it's something that we can try
out on the device in the place


114
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,626
where people will be using it.


115
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:36,976
So, we've made a fake app; now
it's time to show it to people;


116
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:40,766
we want to ask them three
questions as we're showing them.


117
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:45,016
Do you know how to do
this one particular thing


118
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:46,176
that we have prototyped?


119
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:49,856
Is it easy to do that thing?


120
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:54,006
And in general, how can
we make this better?


121
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:57,116
We want to solicit
kind of freeform input


122
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:58,706
on how we can improve our app.


123
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:01,866
You'd be surprised what
interesting things people have


124
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:03,186
to say.


125
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,146
So who do we show
our fake apps to?


126
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:09,046
Makes sense, the
people your app is for.


127
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:12,046
So, if your app isn't
for engineers,


128
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:16,046
go and find some people
who are not engineers.


129
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:19,576
Don't argue, defend or dismiss.


130
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,276
You're not there to
debate the pros and cons


131
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,826
of what you've prototyped.


132
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:28,906
You're there to get information
from people and learn from them.


133
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:30,366
So we've showed some people.


134
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,716
We've probably taken some notes.


135
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:32,246
We've probed.


136
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:33,356
We've asked a few questions.


137
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:39,076
Now we ask ourselves three
questions about what to do next.


138
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:41,856
What's working in
what we showed them?


139
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,016
What's not working?


140
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:44,476
What did people did
not understand?


141
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:47,636
What did they stumble over
or was confusing in some way?


142
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:50,836
And what other ideas
does this give us


143
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:53,246
about what we might
want to do next?


144
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:58,596
So again, make, show and
learn, and we do this over


145
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,176
and over again until
the experience


146
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,676
of our product is great.


147
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:03,846
Now today, we're going to do


148
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,236
that in a few different
ways for you guys.


149
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:07,546
We're going to prototype
with pictures,


150
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,156
just drawing for the device.


151
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,286
Then we're going to
prototype with animation,


152
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,156
so we can see how
different screens


153
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,336
that we've drawn work together.


154
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:18,656
And then we're going to
prototype with interaction,


155
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,866
so we can see how the
entire experience feels


156
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,066
in our hand on the device.


157
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:25,976
Now to prototype with
pictures, we're actually going


158
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:26,616
to do it in Keynote today.


159
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:29,456
Keynote is fast, easy
and cheap and a lot


160
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:31,166
of you probably already
have it on your computer.


161
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:34,155
But in practice, you can
use anything that can chop


162
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,976
up pictures and draw
a few basic shapes.


163
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,765
For animation, we're actually
also going to prototype


164
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:43,275
with Keynote, which is a
surprisingly sophisticated


165
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,076
animation tool.


166
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,626
But you can use anything
that can move pictures


167
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,956
around on the screen over time.


168
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,046
And to prototype
our interactions,


169
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,456
we're actually going to use
-objective-C and Core Animation.


170
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:57,456
That's what we use frequently
to prototype concepts.


171
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,556
And it's actually
easier than you think


172
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,066
if you're not a developer.


173
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,736
If you are a developer,
you're going to see us use it


174
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:09,106
in a slightly different way
than you might be used to.


175
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:12,136
So, I'd like to recap
for you the key features


176
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,746
of "Toast Modern," our
beautiful, world-changing,


177
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:18,006
disruptive application.


178
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,646
We want to find toast
to eat near me,


179
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:27,146
want to find the top toast to
eat, post toast, rate toast,


180
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:29,066
and review and discuss toast


181
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:31,036
with my fellow toast
aficionados.


182
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,426
These are a lot of
toast features.


183
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,856
So, we're actually just going
to pare it down to talking


184
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,596
about the first two,
finding top toast to eat,


185
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:42,246
and finding toast
to eat near me.


186
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,396
To begin the prototyping
process,


187
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:46,546
I'd like to ask Linda
Dong to come to the stage.


188
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:54,196
[ Applause ]


189
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:55,556
>> Thanks Jeff.


190
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,186
Good morning.


191
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:01,826
So, to figure out how finding
toast in our app is going


192
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:05,476
to work, we're going to
begin by making pictures.


193
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:10,626
So here we start off by drawing
just a ton of different sketches


194
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,696
to quickly get down all
the ideas in our heads


195
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:17,426
for ways we can show nearby
as well as top-rated toast.


196
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:21,946
Now, on our team, we always
start from hand drawn concepts.


197
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:25,536
I'm going to really emphasize
that you guys all do it too


198
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,596
if you're not already
doing this.


199
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:30,826
There's just no faster
or cheaper way


200
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:34,226
to get ideas flowing,
to explore a whole slew


201
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:35,996
of directions than
through drawing.


202
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:38,236
And drawing is fun.


203
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,276
Like who doesn't want
to dream of a ton


204
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,336
of crazy disposable ideas.


205
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,056
Not you guys, right?


206
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,716
And keep in mind.


207
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,536
You don't have to be
an artist to do this.


208
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:51,296
Maybe your drawings
look more like this.


209
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,836
Whatever. I mean
don't go showing this


210
00:10:55,836 --> 00:11:00,086
to like board meetings or
anything, but the point remains


211
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:02,206
that we're trying to emphasize


212
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:05,086
that you should not
start prototyping


213
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:06,376
from just a single idea.


214
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:10,456
You want to explore and
understand the whole space


215
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:14,086
in order to figure out the
best direction for your app.


216
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:19,156
So when we were comparing all
of our ideas, there were four


217
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:22,606
that stood out as really
compelling: this list,


218
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:25,926
grid, map, and gallery.


219
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:28,646
So why did we choose these four?


220
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:31,876
Well, not only do
they convey our type


221
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:34,626
of information really well.


222
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,636
They also, unlike some
of the other ideas,


223
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:40,756
aren't overly complex
or too elaborate.


224
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:42,746
We want to start simple.


225
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,906
Also, they represent
four distinct directions


226
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,956
that our app can take as opposed


227
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,436
to being variations
of a single idea.


228
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,796
And great, isn't this awesome
that we found all of this


229
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:59,466
out super quick on paper
before devoting a lot


230
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:02,456
of time exploring
just one concept.


231
00:12:02,946 --> 00:12:08,116
And so, I've got my sketches
and it's no big deal now.


232
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,786
They're just sketches, so I can
just throw away all the other


233
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:13,526
ideas that didn't
work out to just focus


234
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:16,106
on making these four more real.


235
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:20,436
And to do that, we're going to
turn them into some fake apps.


236
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:24,526
So, the first question we're
going to ask ourselves is,


237
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:25,976
what needs to be more real?


238
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,886
Why are we making
these fake apps?


239
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:29,096
What's our goal?


240
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:31,446
So right now we just
have drawings.


241
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,166
So before we even think
about touching any code,


242
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:38,006
we're going to determine
how these ideas will look


243
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,976
on the screen in our hands.


244
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:44,106
Second question we're going to
ask ourselves: What can we fake?


245
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:45,956
What shortcuts can we take?


246
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:49,726
Well, we can fake pretty
much all the content.


247
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:54,456
We don't need a database of
toast photographs or locations,


248
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,776
we can make up filler
text and we're going


249
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,986
to use temporary icons.


250
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:01,676
And lastly, where
will we use it?


251
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:03,636
Well, we're going
to put these screens


252
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:06,846
on an actual iPhone
and use them outside.


253
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:11,526
So, we're going to start
off with the sketch


254
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,926
of a toast list view
sorted by rating.


255
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,366
Now, before we dive straight
into translating this


256
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:19,156
to the screen, we're
going to see


257
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:22,136
if we can save ourselves some
time by borrowing elements


258
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,646
from existing iOS apps.


259
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:28,516
And just from browsing
on my phone, I've noticed


260
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:31,966
that the music app actually
has a really similar structure


261
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:33,286
to our sketch.


262
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:38,096
So let's use this as a way
to kind of lay out our idea.


263
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:41,676
And the way we're going to
do that is we're just going


264
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:45,426
to take a snapshot of
the screen from our phone


265
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,256
and import it into
Keynote for Mac.


266
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:53,146
Now, we on our team use
Keynote really frequently


267
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,416
to make super quick
prototypes because it has a ton


268
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,676
of really useful tools that
make aligning photographs


269
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,216
and images really easy.


270
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:04,576
But you guys should be using
whatever image editing tool


271
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:05,926
you're most comfortable in.


272
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,846
So if you've done this type
of stuff before, maybe you're


273
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,056
in Photoshop or Pixelmator
or Sketch.


274
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:15,326
If you're a developer who's
never done image editing before,


275
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:19,346
a great place to start
off is Preview for Mac.


276
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:21,566
So we've got our screenshot.


277
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:22,576
What do we do next?


278
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:27,506
Well, we want to block off the
main areas of the UI in order


279
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:30,136
to create ourselves a
type of template to drop


280
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,426
in our own content into.


281
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:35,206
So the way we're going to do
that in Keynote is actually open


282
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:39,276
up the Shape Menu and drop
in just a ton of boxes


283
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:43,586
to block off the navigation
bar, all the photographs,


284
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:47,676
the borders and the background.


285
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:51,286
So great, now we have a basic
structure to work off of.


286
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:55,766
Next up is to get
that navigation bar


287
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:56,776
to be the right color.


288
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,346
So to do that in Keynote,
you open up the Color Picker,


289
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,396
and using that magnifying
glass tool, sample the color


290
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:06,526
of the status bar above it.


291
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:09,096
And now we've got ourselves
a blank navigation bar.


292
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,626
Now, that was really
simple, right?


293
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:14,166
Well, that's because
we're using a screenshot.


294
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:18,836
So, you don't need to know exact
pixel dimensions or even colors


295
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,476
of UI elements in order
to re-create them,


296
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:23,546
which saves us a ton of time.


297
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:27,846
And so, the next thing I want to
do is just add in some content.


298
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,116
And in particular, some images.


299
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:34,856
So, here's some photographs
I took this morning


300
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:39,126
on my daily toast excursion,
and I'm just going to put


301
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:40,136
in this good looking one.


302
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,866
And now that I'm looking at
that photograph, I'm thinking,


303
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,946
maybe instead of just a
plain square thumbnail,


304
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:51,416
we could do something cool where
we crop the image to a circle


305
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,426
so all you can see is
the plate and the toast.


306
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:57,846
And so, luckily for us,
Keynote actually has a great set


307
00:15:57,846 --> 00:16:01,006
of options to be able to
mask an image to any shape.


308
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,776
So, we're going to
choose the Oval Mask here,


309
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:08,476
and now we've got a perfectly
cropped plate of toast


310
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:12,666
that we can - yes, thank
you guy - that we can put


311
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,326
into our placeholder, and
we're just going to repeat


312
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:18,586
that same process
for other images.


313
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:23,166
Now, notice, we're just using
the same three images over


314
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,646
and over again, and that's
because we don't want


315
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:28,206
to spend more time than
necessary creating content.


316
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:32,256
Three pictures of toast for all
of your screens, totally fine.


317
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:36,636
And so, once these images are
in place, now we can get rid


318
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:37,416
of those placeholders.


319
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:40,596
And right off the bat, I'm
sure you're noticing this,


320
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,176
you can't see the plates of
toast on that background.


321
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,036
So, how do we fix that?


322
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:46,766
Do we add borders?


323
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,246
Do we add drop shadows?


324
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,096
Do we change the
background image?


325
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,336
Like what are the
parameters that we use?


326
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:53,876
Well, hold on.


327
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:56,786
Those are all visual
design decisions


328
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,976
that we can make further down
the line if we even decide


329
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,676
to go with this direction.


330
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,376
For now, we're going to
do something super basic


331
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:09,106
and just add in a simple
one pixel border around all


332
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:11,226
of our images, and done.


333
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,925
We're - it's already
more visible.


334
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:15,786
We can worry about the
details of it later.


335
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:19,236
And so now I've got
my images of toast.


336
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:20,306
I want to label them.


337
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,266
And so to help us out with that,
we're actually going to take


338
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,076
that white box we were
using as a background


339
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:26,656
and make it transparent.


340
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:29,236
So, this way the music app
is now peeking through,


341
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:33,856
and we can see how the labels
in that screen are laid


342
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:40,196
out in order to help us lay
out and size our own text.


343
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:42,516
And now notice, these
locations don't exist.


344
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,986
You can't get toast with
goat butter and trout on it.


345
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:47,366
That's not a thing.


346
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,716
We're just faking text
because it's quick


347
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,866
and we don't have
to worry about it.


348
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,536
So, cool, this is actually
really coming together.


349
00:17:56,546 --> 00:18:00,976
We just can up the opacity
of the background again


350
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,706
and make some little
tweaks and adjustments


351
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,676
so that the layout works
for our composition.


352
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:09,936
So, the only thing that's
missing right now is ratings.


353
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,086
And so, for this, I'm
actually going to go


354
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:16,496
into the Special Characters
menu, which some of you guys may


355
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,786
or may not be already
familiar with.


356
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:24,286
So here, we actually get a giant
list of pre-existing symbols


357
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,786
and characters that
we could repurpose


358
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,996
as icons for our layout.


359
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:34,276
So, I found myself a really
nice star symbol that I want


360
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:35,846
to use to represent ratings.


361
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:39,956
I'm just going to drop a ton of
those in, align them together,


362
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:42,416
and we've got some
ratings, awesome.


363
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:46,136
Now, I think this
looks pretty OK,


364
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:49,526
but I think those stars
could really use a tint color


365
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:51,336
because I want to make
them look active later.


366
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,406
So, what particular color
you use now doesn't matter.


367
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:01,016
So, we're just going to go into
Keynotes default color palette


368
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:04,056
and choose a color
that makes sense.


369
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:07,046
So, here I chose orange
because it's the toastiest color


370
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:08,466
of the rainbow.


371
00:19:09,726 --> 00:19:11,696
Great, now I've got
some orange stars


372
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:13,566
and they look more
active already.


373
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:16,376
And I really like that
color so I'm actually going


374
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,626
to change the borders around
my image to be the same color.


375
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:21,506
And now we've got a
nice relationship going


376
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:24,956
between the picture of the toast
and its rating through color.


377
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:29,726
And so, last but not least,
I'm going to add a control


378
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:33,946
to the top right-hand side of
this app so that someone can add


379
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:36,266
in a new photograph
of a piece of toast.


380
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:43,386
And here, we could get all fancy
with custom shapes, and masking,


381
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:45,876
and doing all sorts
of intricate stuff.


382
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,896
But remember we only care about
temporary icons right now.


383
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:54,436
So instead, we are literally
going to add in a text box,


384
00:19:55,996 --> 00:20:00,356
type in the plus symbol, and
now you've designed an icon


385
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:01,276
in five seconds.


386
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:02,386
Congratulations.


387
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:06,716
All right, yeah,
plus signs, cool.


388
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:10,876
And last but not least,
just scribble on a title


389
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,196
for your screen,
and there you go.


390
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:18,986
One freshly baked screen
ready to be tested.


391
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:23,366
Now, one thing to really keep in
mind when you're making screens


392
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:27,816
on any program is to remember
to zoom out to the physical size


393
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:31,686
of the device that your
screen is going to live on.


394
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:35,806
It's really easy to get caught
up working at a zoom level


395
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:39,406
where everything is big,
and clear, and legible.


396
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:43,526
So, remember, every time
you added a new element


397
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:47,746
onto the screen, to zoom out,
and check if that piece of text


398
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:52,006
or that picture is both
readable, legible, and tappable,


399
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:53,916
and catch that early on.


400
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:58,786
So, now we've got
one screen ready.


401
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,446
And that screen took us
about 10 minutes to make.


402
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:06,406
If we were to have
worried too much


403
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:09,496
about all the visual nuances
that the screen could have,


404
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:11,516
we would be here
for the next hour


405
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:13,456
and this would be a
really boring presentation.


406
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,996
Instead, we took shortcuts.


407
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,936
And that's fine because
these aren't going


408
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:21,106
to be our final screens.


409
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,616
And so, I'm going to rinse
and repeat that process


410
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,456
of screenshotting,
masking, arranging objects,


411
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:31,036
and adding basic content
to the rest of our ideas,


412
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:35,186
like our GridView idea, which
looks like the camera roll.


413
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:39,406
And in practice, it's like,
ah, kind of too much toast.


414
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:43,466
That's a lot of toast
to look at.


415
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,596
Or our map idea which
- I don't know,


416
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,776
that looks pretty interesting.


417
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:51,606
I think that would be
really fun to play with.


418
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:53,926
Or our gallery weather app idea,


419
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,086
which just like looks
really cool.


420
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:00,726
And so, now I've
got my four screens,


421
00:22:00,726 --> 00:22:03,316
and again they're not going
to be our final designs.


422
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:08,036
There're many places where
we could refine the visual


423
00:22:08,716 --> 00:22:14,846
appearance and/or the
styling of all of the screens.


424
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:18,596
But we're not going to
do that because it's OK,


425
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:20,646
because we didn't make
these applications


426
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:22,226
to become gorgeous hero shots.


427
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:24,156
We made them so that
we could test


428
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:26,826
out how successful
each concept will be.


429
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,226
That way when we
do devote our time


430
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:34,156
and effort polishing the
visuals of our final screen,


431
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:37,016
we'll know we're doing
it to the right idea.


432
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,916
And so, what's next?


433
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:43,216
Well, we have our screens,
we're going to drop them


434
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:46,386
onto an iPhone and give
them to people to test out.


435
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,196
So, the way we're going to do
that is we're going to go back


436
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:52,556
into Keynote and export our
presentation into images,


437
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:54,166
and specifically PNGs.


438
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,406
And then use whatever
method you want


439
00:22:57,406 --> 00:22:59,296
to get those images
onto your phone.


440
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:03,176
So that might be Photo
Stream, the new iCloud drive,


441
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,866
or you can just email
them to yourself.


442
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:10,126
And then once you've
got them on your phone,


443
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:13,206
give them to your friends,
give them to your coworkers,


444
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:17,346
give them to a variety of
people and just observe them


445
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,356
like looking at the
screens for right now.


446
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:23,046
See if they can even figure
out what this app does.


447
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:26,616
See if it reads differently
indoors as opposed


448
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:28,466
to outdoors - it probably will.


449
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:32,306
And then once you've just
observed them for a little bit,


450
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:38,156
you want to ask them three
questions: "Do you know how


451
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:39,826
to find top-rated toast?"


452
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:41,206
"What about nearby toast?"


453
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:45,696
And the feedback that we
got was, "Yeah, ratings,


454
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,276
the star icons make
it really obvious how


455
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,426
to find top-rated toast.


456
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:53,196
But, nearby toast is
really hard to figure


457
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:54,546
out if it's not laid
out on a map."


458
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:57,876
So, that's really useful
information for you to have


459
00:23:57,876 --> 00:23:59,826
in order to make
iterations of your screen.


460
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,716
Second thing you want to ask,


461
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:04,736
"Is it easy to browse
through toast?"


462
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:10,746
And it seems that, yeah people
are having a pretty easy time


463
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,506
reading through all the
screens except for of course


464
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,166
that grid view that no one likes


465
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,356
because it's hurting
the retinas.


466
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:20,466
And then lastly: "How
can we make this better?"


467
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:21,696
"How can we improve?"


468
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:26,026
And maybe we just got the
consensus that, you know,


469
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:28,666
you guys should really go
through the list and the Mappy,


470
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,406
that seems to really
resonate with people.


471
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,096
We should probably
refine the interactions


472
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,416
of those two screens more.


473
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:38,296
And so, to tell you how
to do that with animation,


474
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:40,956
I'm actually going to invite
Julian Missig on to the stage.


475
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:45,546
[ Applause ]


476
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:46,516
>> Thank you Linda.


477
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:49,456
Now, that we've gathered
some of this feedback,


478
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,656
I'm going to take you
through another spin


479
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:53,246
around this prototyping cycle.


480
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:58,176
So, we should take a step
back and learn from some


481
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,726
of the feedback we got.


482
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:01,956
What's working so far?


483
00:25:02,496 --> 00:25:05,366
Well, we have a variety
of methods


484
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,946
of organizing this information.


485
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:12,576
We have lists and
galleries, grids, maps.


486
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:19,026
We don't yet have one best way
to find and discover toast.


487
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:20,576
We have a couple of them.


488
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:26,426
Sometimes, people seem to prefer
to look for toast by rating.


489
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:28,786
And sometimes, they just want
to find the closest toast.


490
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,206
So perhaps, our app
could let people choose.


491
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:37,566
Sometimes, people could
search for toast by rating,


492
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:40,406
and sometimes they could
look for it on a map.


493
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:44,656
So we'd like to make
a prototype to try


494
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:46,606
to understand how
this could work.


495
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,826
The thing that we
want to make more real


496
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:56,216
in this prototype is the
connection between a screen


497
00:25:56,216 --> 00:26:00,116
that has top toast and a
screen that has a map on it


498
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,476
because our app is going to
have both of these things in it


499
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:04,766
at some point in time.


500
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:09,146
We don't yet need to make
fully interactive screens.


501
00:26:09,146 --> 00:26:11,566
We don't need to be able to
tap on each piece of toast.


502
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:12,976
We don't need to scroll
through these lists.


503
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:14,516
We actually don't even need


504
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:16,866
to have final designs
for these screens.


505
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,616
Because, if we're
doing things correctly,


506
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:22,976
we're probably actually going
to go back and redraw some


507
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:24,996
of these screens based
upon what we've learned.


508
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:29,976
As we make a more
realistic prototype,


509
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:33,326
we should also make our
context a little bit more real.


510
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:37,076
So in this case, this is not
the part of the app where we're


511
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,816
in a restaurant taking pictures.


512
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:42,326
We're still trying to find
the restaurant we will be at.


513
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:48,516
So, I'm probably walking around
on a busy sidewalk starting


514
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:51,246
to get really hungry looking
for a piece of toast to eat.


515
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,536
I'm going to be kind of
distracted, not paying a lot


516
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:54,616
of attention to my phone.


517
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,086
This means that I'm not going
to spend a lot of time trying


518
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:01,496
to figure out how this app
works and navigate through it.


519
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,176
I'm just looking for
those restaurants.


520
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,356
As I was mentioning before,
the thing that we want


521
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:09,336
to make more realistic in this
prototype is the connection


522
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:12,006
or relationship between
two difference screens.


523
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:17,606
At one point in time, this
app is going to have a screen


524
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:19,916
that will have Top
Toast, the ratings.


525
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,756
At another point in time,
this app will have a screen


526
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:25,546
that will have Nearby
Toast or a map.


527
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:29,406
So this app is going to
be changing over time


528
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:30,936
between these two screens.


529
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,276
And a change over time
is an animation, right?


530
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:38,786
Now, there are variety of tools


531
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,726
that you can use
to make animations.


532
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:44,796
If you're a designer, you
might be familiar with tools


533
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,656
such as Motion, AfterEffects,
or Quartz Composer.


534
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:52,946
If you're a developer, you
might use tools such as HTML,


535
00:27:52,996 --> 00:27:54,956
CSS animations or Processing.


536
00:27:55,506 --> 00:28:00,116
Either way, we think you
might be able to use tools


537
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:03,316
such as Hype, iAd
Producer or Keynote.


538
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:07,766
As Jeff mentioned earlier,


539
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,706
we're going to be building
these animations in Keynote.


540
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:13,146
We can actually run
Keynote on our iPhone


541
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,776
and see the animations
live there.


542
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,296
We can make modifications
rapidly back on our Mac


543
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:21,256
and see those changes
reflected on our iPhone.


544
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:22,656
It's really quick,
and it's a tool


545
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,146
that we use a lot in our team.


546
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:29,226
So, we're just going
to open up Keynote,


547
00:28:29,996 --> 00:28:34,086
and we will grab the two
slides that we made earlier


548
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:37,566
and drop them in as the only
two slides in our presentation.


549
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:43,756
We will go over to the Animate
palette and choose a transition.


550
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:47,156
Here, we'll just choose
Move In from Bottom to Top.


551
00:28:47,156 --> 00:28:50,706
Let's just see what
that looks like.


552
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:58,726
So, this slide in from bottom
to top is perhaps like some


553
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:01,176
of the sheet animations
that iOS has


554
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:03,066
where it's some temporary
information laid


555
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,506
on top of other information.


556
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,366
Maybe let's move
out horizontally.


557
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:12,276
Well this looks a lot like
the navigate back animation.


558
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:14,086
You're going back up the
navigation hierarchy.


559
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:17,946
Maybe we could flip it over.


560
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,186
Maybe this is some
kind of setting


561
00:29:22,186 --> 00:29:24,436
or information behind
that other screen.


562
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:28,176
The thing that I'm trying
to get across here is


563
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:32,196
that any animation you choose
is communicating something


564
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,286
about the relationship


565
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:35,156
that these screens
have with one another.


566
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:38,906
Even if it's no animation
at all, if it's just a pop,


567
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:43,456
that's something that shows
almost no relationship


568
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:44,306
between the screens.


569
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:45,736
They're just being
replaced by one another.


570
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,966
But in this case, that's not
really what's going on here.


571
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:54,486
What we have is two different
views of the same information.


572
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,976
Perhaps those three
restaurants that are


573
00:29:56,976 --> 00:29:59,806
in the map are three
restaurants from that list.


574
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:02,736
So that's something we want to
communicate as we transition


575
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:03,706
between these screens.


576
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:08,936
Now, before we get a little
bit further within Keynote,


577
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:12,056
I just like to explain something
about two different types


578
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:14,266
of animation within Keynote.


579
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:18,926
The first is called
a build animation.


580
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:21,926
These are animations
that happen on objects


581
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:23,616
or shapes within a slide.


582
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:27,156
You can build in a shape,


583
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:29,656
perform some actions
on it, build it out.


584
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:32,596
You can use the Build
Order palette to set


585
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:34,606
up a pretty sophisticated
sequence


586
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,166
of build animations
all within a slide.


587
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:42,406
But there's another type of
animation called a transition.


588
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,606
And the transition
is an animation


589
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:47,166
that happens between two slides.


590
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:50,056
Those were the animations we
were just playing with now.


591
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,546
There's a particular kind


592
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:56,296
of transition called Magic
Move that's really interesting


593
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:58,616
for our purposes.


594
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:03,096
What Magic Move does, is it
tries to identify objects


595
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:06,166
or shapes that are the
same on the two slides


596
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:12,286
and it will create an
interpolation of the position,


597
00:31:12,386 --> 00:31:15,156
sizing, opacity and other
properties of those shapes.


598
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:22,186
So for example, if Magic Move
identifies the three circles


599
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,926
as the same on these two slides,


600
00:31:24,336 --> 00:31:28,696
it might produce an
animation like this.


601
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:30,736
Now if you're familiar
with animation tools,


602
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,766
you might recognize, we're
starting to use these slides


603
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,866
as if they are key frames
in a larger animation.


604
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:41,286
That makes it a lot
easier to sequence out


605
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:43,566
and separate the different
steps of our animation.


606
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:47,416
So we're going to
go back to Keynote


607
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:51,206
and choose the Animate palette.


608
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:55,806
Now that you know about
Keynote's two types


609
00:31:55,806 --> 00:31:57,506
of animation, I'll just
note here real quick,


610
00:31:58,276 --> 00:31:59,816
if you have a shape selected,


611
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:02,486
the Animate palette will
show you Build animations.


612
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:06,606
If you have no shape selected,
if it's just the slide,


613
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:09,206
that's when you'll get
these transition animations


614
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,186
that we're using today.


615
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,126
We're going to change the
transition to Magic Move.


616
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:18,026
And without changing anything
at all about those two slides


617
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:20,566
that we've dropped in, let's
see what Magic Move gives us.


618
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:27,506
So you can see there's
already a lot more interesting


619
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,516
than the transitions we
were playing with earlier.


620
00:32:30,246 --> 00:32:35,906
Because we built these slides in
Keynote and use the same images


621
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,456
on both the lists and the map,


622
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:41,286
the Magic Move transition
moved those images over,


623
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:42,196
and we can start to see


624
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:44,476
that maybe those restaurants are
the same on those two screens.


625
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:46,226
Maybe that's an interesting
way to do this transition.


626
00:32:46,786 --> 00:32:49,916
But there are a couple of
things that we can make better.


627
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:53,836
The first thing that I noticed
was that, within our prototype,


628
00:32:53,836 --> 00:32:56,996
we don't really even
have a fake way to get


629
00:32:56,996 --> 00:32:58,166
between these two screens.


630
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:01,296
So to make it a little bit more
realistic so that we can kind


631
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:04,396
of imagine how you would
navigate between these screens,


632
00:33:04,836 --> 00:33:06,576
we'll just drop in
a tab bar for now.


633
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:09,026
And this tab bar, similar


634
00:33:09,026 --> 00:33:12,176
to the things Linda was showing
you earlier, is just a rectangle


635
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:15,626
from the Shapes tool in Keynote.


636
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:19,036
The star could be from
the special characters,


637
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:21,636
the star shape, and
that little map icon,


638
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:23,616
that's just using the Line tool


639
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,976
to draw a quick little
placeholder.


640
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,156
These don't need
to be perfect just


641
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:31,276
yet because we don't even know


642
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:33,806
if this is the direction
we're going to take.


643
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:41,006
I also noticed how
the list faded out.


644
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:45,266
We had white for a while,
and then the map faded in.


645
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:50,466
This is because what Magic Move
is doing is fading out shapes


646
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:54,026
that won't exist first for the
first half of the animation.


647
00:33:54,506 --> 00:33:57,956
And then after that
midpoint, the second half


648
00:33:57,956 --> 00:34:00,646
of the animation is
fading in new shapes.


649
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:04,126
So we can get around
that by making sure


650
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,086
that our shapes exist
on both slides.


651
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:11,176
So I'm going to copy that
map image that I want to fade


652
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,646
in throughout the entire
duration of the animation.


653
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,476
I'm going to copy that
from the second slide,


654
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,766
paste it on that first slide,


655
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:23,846
move it all the way behind all
the other shapes, and then,


656
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:26,406
just for fun, I'm going to
make it a little bit larger


657
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:28,176
than it is on the second slide.


658
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:32,446
So, what the Magic Move
animation will give us will be


659
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,235
maybe a little bit of
a perspective shift


660
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:37,025
as the map is shrinking
as it's fading in.


661
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:39,315
Let's see what that looks like.


662
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:45,246
It's pretty neat.


663
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:49,136
But there are a couple
of other things we can do


664
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:50,315
to make this even better.


665
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:54,116
Because right now, we're not
writing any code, so we can try


666
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:59,076
out some- maybe over-the-top
animations and take them


667
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:01,566
out later, pare it down
to just what it needs.


668
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:06,476
But for now, it's so
little work to explore a lot


669
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:07,696
of interesting alternatives


670
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:10,246
that we should just try
everything we think we


671
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:10,766
might try.


672
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:16,476
In this example here,
I am looking


673
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:18,936
at the title of those
two slides.


674
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:22,196
The title was another
one where we faded


675
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:26,406
out that Top Toast title and
then faded in Nearby Toast.


676
00:35:26,406 --> 00:35:27,476
Then it faded through gray.


677
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:31,136
But I didn't really
like how that looked.


678
00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:34,236
So, I'm going to copy
the Top Toast label


679
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,056
from the first slide.


680
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:36,326
Paste it on the second slide.


681
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:38,366
Do vice versa so that both


682
00:35:38,366 --> 00:35:39,816
of those labels exist
on those slides.


683
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:43,196
I'm going to shift the
one that should be fading


684
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:45,686
out horizontally
off to one side,


685
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:48,256
drop its opacity down to zero.


686
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:50,596
Here I have it a little bit
higher just so you can see it.


687
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:55,796
But the effect that it will give
is the title will be fading in


688
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:58,206
and sliding horizontally
at the same time


689
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,586
as the other one is fading out.


690
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:03,306
I also wanted to do something


691
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:06,036
about those restaurant
names in the list.


692
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:09,436
I didn't like that they
just faded out in place.


693
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:13,546
So I copied those restaurant
names from the first slide,


694
00:36:14,276 --> 00:36:17,636
that list; pasted them on
the second slide, the map;


695
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:20,596
and I shift them way off
of the side of the screen.


696
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:22,826
It'll drop their
opacity a little bit.


697
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:24,796
So look on a slide out.


698
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,156
Now, a little bit
of a pro tip here.


699
00:36:27,156 --> 00:36:30,016
If you stagger them
horizontally a little bit,


700
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:34,096
the animation speeds will
be a little bit different


701
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:35,036
for each item.


702
00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:39,166
So they will feel like
distinct items, not like part


703
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:41,996
of one sheet sliding away,
because these are distinct items


704
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:44,186
in a list and we'd
like to reinforce that.


705
00:36:47,096 --> 00:36:51,496
Finally, once I've built up both
of these slides to the point


706
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:55,356
where I'm pretty happy with
them, I will have an animation


707
00:36:55,356 --> 00:36:56,256
from the list to the map.


708
00:36:57,076 --> 00:36:59,996
But to get an animation from
the map back to the list,


709
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:04,686
all I have to do is duplicate
that first slide, that list,


710
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:07,596
and place it at the
end as a third slide.


711
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:11,456
And now, without doing any extra
work, I have an animation back


712
00:37:11,456 --> 00:37:12,416
in the other direction.


713
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:14,576
It's important to test
out both directions,


714
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,646
and it really didn't
take much to do this.


715
00:37:18,996 --> 00:37:24,216
So let's see what we
have after we've built


716
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:25,036
up all that animation.


717
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:28,406
In the back.


718
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:32,046
And I'll show it to
you a little slower


719
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,166
so you can see some
of the details.


720
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:36,306
Maybe this isn't as slow as we
would have it in the real app.


721
00:37:39,236 --> 00:37:42,876
We did all of this without
having to write any code.


722
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,646
And you can see how - maybe some
of it is a little over the top.


723
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:46,976
Thank you.

[ Applause ]


725
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:54,086
Maybe some of it is a
little over the top.


726
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:57,626
But it's so much easier to
pare down and take away things


727
00:37:57,626 --> 00:37:59,136
when you don't have
to throw away code.


728
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:00,696
It's just moving shapes around.


729
00:38:01,286 --> 00:38:03,136
That's a really great way to try


730
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:05,116
out some really sophisticated
animations.


731
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:11,356
We also really like this
very graphical gallery view


732
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,746
that Linda called out
as pretty cool earlier.


733
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:15,966
I wanted to see how
it would work


734
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:19,636
if we have these angled plates
of toast and we zoom in on one


735
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:20,956
of them just to see
a detail view.


736
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:25,836
And then back out.


737
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:27,046
When we tap the Back button.


738
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:28,976
And I'll show this to you
again a little slower.

[ Applause ]


742
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,576
So how did we build
this animation?


743
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:46,436
Well, it really was
not all that different


744
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:48,546
from the process I
showed you earlier.


745
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,306
That one piece of toast
that we zoom in on?


746
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:57,206
That's an angled image
behind all the other shapes.


747
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:01,606
The other pieces of
toast are similar images


748
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,396
but they're masked
out and on top.


749
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,646
That navigation bar
that slides in?


750
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,066
That's a black rectangle


751
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:10,476
that we've shifted off
the top of the screen.


752
00:39:10,546 --> 00:39:13,586
So, we shifted it off a little
ways up there so it slides


753
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:15,166
in a little bit later
in the animation.


754
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:19,186
And that detail view
of the toast?


755
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:22,636
That's that same toast
image rotated back straight,


756
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:25,106
made a bit larger.


757
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,756
The other pieces of toast
are just shifted off the top


758
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:30,616
and bottom of the screen.


759
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:32,396
That's really all
there is to it.


760
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:34,586
It's moving some
images and shapes


761
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:36,246
around until you
get an animation


762
00:39:36,246 --> 00:39:38,406
that feels pretty good.


763
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,736
So now that we've built
these animations in Keynote,


764
00:39:44,736 --> 00:39:48,226
we're going to launch Keynote
on our iPod touch here.


765
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,246
And either through iCloud
or email, however you prefer


766
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:56,476
to get them across, actually
open that same presentation


767
00:39:57,366 --> 00:40:01,336
in our hand on the device to
get a sense for how it feels.


768
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:09,296
We can hand it to someone
and see what they try to do.


769
00:40:09,536 --> 00:40:15,476
Now, here you'll notice that
we're tapping on what seem


770
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:16,606
like interactive elements.


771
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,556
Those aren't actually
interactive.


772
00:40:18,556 --> 00:40:24,006
It just so happens that you
can tap anywhere on the screen


773
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:25,366
to advance a sliding Keynote.


774
00:40:25,816 --> 00:40:28,346
So you can kind of pretend that
the interactive elements work.


775
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:30,126
Of course, if you
tap anywhere else,


776
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:31,516
it's still going to
advance the slide.


777
00:40:33,226 --> 00:40:36,356
Or you can still get a sense
for where people are trying


778
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:38,506
to interact with your
screens and animations


779
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:40,596
and what they expect to happen.


780
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:45,966
We can do a similar
thing with the tab bar.


781
00:40:57,946 --> 00:41:02,996
And after we show people and
let them express what they think


782
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:05,146
these animations and
these screens are about,


783
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:07,576
we can ask them a couple
of questions to try


784
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:09,166
to get specific feedback.


785
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:15,006
So we ask if they know
how to find nearby toast.


786
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,696
Well, they were able to find
toast although they didn't


787
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:19,216
understand our placeholder
icons.


788
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:22,806
But that's fine because we knew
those icons were placeholders,


789
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:26,666
and if we decide to go in this
direction, we can refine them.


790
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:30,846
When we ask if it
was easy to switch


791
00:41:30,886 --> 00:41:32,016
between these two screens,


792
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:35,896
certainly they were
able to use a tab bar.


793
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:36,846
They've seen those before.


794
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:39,046
They could tap at the
bottom and switch screens.


795
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:44,626
But when we asked, how
could we make this better?


796
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:48,506
That's where we got some
really interesting feedback.


797
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:51,926
Someone suggested they
might want to be able


798
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:56,216
to see restaurant names while
they're looking at the map.


799
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,026
Another person suggested
they'd like to be able


800
00:41:58,026 --> 00:41:59,956
to see the map while they're
looking at the ratings.


801
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,586
Perhaps they want to make
their own calculations


802
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,056
of highest-rated
but closest toast.


803
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:09,866
So those were both really
interesting bits of feedback,


804
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:12,326
and I think I'm going
to invite Mark


805
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:15,536
up to discuss how we can
explore these interactively.

00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:22,186
Good morning.


809
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:24,896
Let's have a look at
what we've learned


810
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:26,166
from the feedback so far.


811
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:28,296
What's working?


812
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,586
The transitions between the
map and the list feel great.


813
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:35,926
Julian showed us how we can
do some really cool animations


814
00:42:36,226 --> 00:42:39,936
without writing a
single line of code.


815
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:40,996
What's not working?


816
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:45,056
We still have to switch between
two screens to get to all


817
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:47,026
of the information about toast.


818
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:51,476
So what other ideas
does this give us?


819
00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:55,026
Well maybe, we can put
the map and the list


820
00:42:55,516 --> 00:43:01,146
on the screen at the same time.


821
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:06,536
A list, a map on one screen.


822
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:12,596
Great. Now we've got all
the information accessible


823
00:43:12,596 --> 00:43:13,406
on one screen.


824
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:16,066
Problem solved.


825
00:43:17,056 --> 00:43:18,206
But wait a second.


826
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:20,236
Is this really a good idea?


827
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,526
If you think about it,
the map is only half


828
00:43:23,526 --> 00:43:26,196
of its original size;
so is the list.


829
00:43:26,596 --> 00:43:28,036
We have to pan the map more.


830
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:30,336
We have to scroll the
list more in order


831
00:43:30,336 --> 00:43:32,796
to access the same
number of information.


832
00:43:36,456 --> 00:43:38,466
To figure out whether
it's a right thing,


833
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:39,646
we need to really try it out,


834
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:41,996
and that's why we create
an interactive prototype.


835
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,986
We make another fake app.


836
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:48,456
And we start off by asking
what needs to be more real?


837
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,256
Finding nearby toast on the
map needs to be more real,


838
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:56,076
and scanning the list for the
best toast should be more real.


839
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:59,726
We want to be able to pan
the map and scroll the list.


840
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:01,806
Now, what can we fake?


841
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:05,756
What can we do to speed up our
process of making the prototype?


842
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:11,276
We can fake the map and
the list by making -


843
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:16,986
using draggable images, but
more to - more about that later.


844
00:44:17,206 --> 00:44:18,596
And where will we use our app?


845
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:22,386
Let's keep that in our mind
while we are creating our


846
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:22,816
fake app.


847
00:44:23,386 --> 00:44:27,076
And of course in our case,
it's when we walk the streets


848
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:30,916
of San Francisco trying to
find the hippest toast in town.


849
00:44:32,056 --> 00:44:33,886
Now making fake apps
is really easy.


850
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:36,816
We are following one
principal guideline.


851
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:40,626
That is, to make pictures
move in response to touches.


852
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:45,246
And one more thing, is to
make pictures move in response


853
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:50,576
to touches on the device
that you are prototyping for.


854
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:54,176
Use whatever you want
that can do this.


855
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,946
If you are from a
web background,


856
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:59,876
you could use HTML,
CSS, a bit of jQuery.


857
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:04,056
If you're a game developer
who happens to use Unity 3D,


858
00:45:04,526 --> 00:45:07,366
it's another great program
to make some pictures move


859
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:10,416
around in response to touches.


860
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,666
Or, you could use Swift.


861
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:15,566
We are super excited
about Swift.


862
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:18,686
But today, we're going
to use Core Animation


863
00:45:18,976 --> 00:45:20,876
and Xcode with Objective-C.


864
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:23,776
This is because that's
what we've been using


865
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:25,416
in our prototyping group so far.


866
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:30,346
Quick word about writing
code for our prototype:


867
00:45:31,306 --> 00:45:33,646
It's different from
writing code for a real app.


868
00:45:33,646 --> 00:45:36,476
The idea is not to engineer it,


869
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:38,736
just hack it together
as quick as you can.


870
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:42,476
It doesn't have to be good
code or reusable code.


871
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:46,226
Because the idea is that
you make your prototype


872
00:45:46,456 --> 00:45:48,766
to make a better decision
about whether you really want


873
00:45:48,766 --> 00:45:54,746
to spend the time
engineering the real thing.


874
00:45:54,966 --> 00:45:58,876
We generally use three steps to
build an interactive prototype.


875
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:02,716
First step: Put the
picture on the device.


876
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:06,406
Once you have a picture on the
device, it's a good indicator


877
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:10,026
that you have got your
workflow sorted out.


878
00:46:10,296 --> 00:46:11,836
Second step: Break
up the picture.


879
00:46:13,066 --> 00:46:16,026
You want to prepare the picture
so you can apply interaction


880
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:18,026
to selected areas on the screen.


881
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,856
And third step: Move the
pictures when you touch them.


882
00:46:23,456 --> 00:46:25,486
This is all about
implementing the interaction.


883
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:26,146
All right.


884
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:31,086
First step: Get the
picture on the device.


885
00:46:31,946 --> 00:46:33,986
We create our picture
in Keynote.


886
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:36,876
And the one thing we have
to consider is that we work


887
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:39,766
to the actual pixel
dimensions of the device.


888
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:44,216
We export our slides
as a PNG and save it


889
00:46:44,216 --> 00:46:49,026
into the folder structure
of our Xcode project.


890
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:50,876
Now it's time to write
a little bit of code.


891
00:46:51,596 --> 00:46:53,556
And what you see here
is the setup function


892
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:54,786
in a classical screen.


893
00:46:55,966 --> 00:46:58,606
Now, another class that you
will see a lot, in our case,


894
00:46:58,606 --> 00:46:59,566
is a class called Layer.


895
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,676
And for those of you who
know about coordination,


896
00:47:03,176 --> 00:47:06,116
it simply just inherits
from UIImageView.


897
00:47:06,436 --> 00:47:09,106
So it also has got all the
functionality of UIView.


898
00:47:09,846 --> 00:47:13,116
All we did is add a little
bit of convenience functions


899
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:16,376
to make our lives easier
to position a layer


900
00:47:16,986 --> 00:47:18,876
and to load an image
into that layer.


901
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:23,936
So by default, we have
a Layer called screen.


902
00:47:24,256 --> 00:47:26,586
It stretches across the
whole of the physical screen.


903
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,226
And so to get our
picture onto our screen,


904
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:32,836
we create another
Layer called picture


905
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:36,856
and we load our image into it.


906
00:47:38,176 --> 00:47:39,346
That's it.


907
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:44,466
We press Play in
Xcode and here it is.


908
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:47,066
Our first Fake App.


909
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:49,796
Looks pretty real
already doesn't it?


910
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:53,686
[ Applause ]


911
00:47:54,186 --> 00:47:54,766
Thanks. All right.


912
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:55,936
Let's get to our second step.


913
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:58,066
We want to break up the picture.


914
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:03,446
In our case, we break it up into
a navigation bar into an image


915
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:06,556
of a list and an image of a map.


916
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:07,836
Let's start with the list.


917
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:10,186
I use Keynote again.


918
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:13,616
And Linda showed how you can
really quickly create a fake


919
00:48:13,616 --> 00:48:14,516
image of a list.


920
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:18,976
Now this time we want to apply
some interaction to the image.


921
00:48:19,256 --> 00:48:22,226
We want to be able to scroll
the image up and down.


922
00:48:22,226 --> 00:48:24,636
So let's make sure
that it's much longer


923
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:26,986
than the screen height
of our device.


924
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:34,506
Next thing, we want to
create a fake image of a map.


925
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:36,746
Where do I get it from?


926
00:48:37,596 --> 00:48:40,336
We improvise a little bit.


927
00:48:40,536 --> 00:48:41,956
I've got the OS X Maps App.


928
00:48:41,956 --> 00:48:42,986
I open it up.


929
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:43,916
Make it full screen.


930
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:44,646
Take a screenshot.


931
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:46,156
Put it in to Keynote.


932
00:48:46,376 --> 00:48:46,996
And there it is.


933
00:48:48,206 --> 00:48:51,066
We also want to display a
few shared toasts on the map.


934
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:56,096
So, let's sprinkle a few
icons onto my toast map.


935
00:48:57,116 --> 00:48:58,886
Just kind of in an
artisanal way.


936
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:02,946
No need to be precise or work
with latitude, longitude values.


937
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:04,536
Just get it done.


938
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:07,286
Again, make sure
it's large enough


939
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:09,886
so we can implement some
direct behavior on it.


940
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:13,936
And fast forward, here we have
our three discrete images.


941
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:17,566
Now it's time to
rearrange the images


942
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:19,006
so they become one screen again.


943
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:24,016
Same type of code,
create a Layer called Map,


944
00:49:24,016 --> 00:49:26,236
load my map image, position
it a little roughly.


945
00:49:27,646 --> 00:49:31,276
Create another list layer -
or a Layer called List rather.


946
00:49:32,446 --> 00:49:34,666
And this time, I'm going
to position it roughly


947
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:36,996
down half of the screen height.


948
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:40,306
And I realize actually, OK,
it already masks my map.


949
00:49:41,786 --> 00:49:43,776
And so does the Navigation
bar at the top.


950
00:49:44,826 --> 00:49:47,876
Cool, we are ready to go.


951
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:51,346
Let's make some pictures
move when you touch them.


952
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,686
Now I want to talk to you
about the drag image behavior.


953
00:49:56,836 --> 00:50:02,976
What happens is, you hit the
map, a touchdown event happens.


954
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:05,736
Then you move your finger


955
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:09,736
and you get a series
of TouchMove events.


956
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:11,446
And on each TouchMove events,


957
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:14,456
we are actually moving the
underlying image with it.


958
00:50:15,656 --> 00:50:17,556
And the last event
is a TouchUp event.


959
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:19,346
I lift off my finger.


960
00:50:20,006 --> 00:50:26,816
Now in order to make that
image move, we essentially go


961
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,516
into each-- well, within
each TouchMove event,


962
00:50:29,936 --> 00:50:32,086
we can deduct the
data translation


963
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:33,776
between the previous
touch position


964
00:50:34,136 --> 00:50:35,366
and the current touch position,


965
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,016
and that's what we
used to move the image.


966
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:42,186
It probably becomes
more clear in code.


967
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:45,866
So, this is a bit of -
this is the code block


968
00:50:45,966 --> 00:50:48,786
that gets called every time
a TouchMove event happens


969
00:50:48,786 --> 00:50:50,366
on our Map layer.


970
00:50:52,076 --> 00:50:55,396
What we do there is we
get our touch object.


971
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:58,246
From there, we can retrieve
the current touch position


972
00:50:58,246 --> 00:50:59,646
and the previous touch position.


973
00:51:00,146 --> 00:51:03,116
And we calculate our delta


974
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:06,156
by subtracting the
previous touch position


975
00:51:06,156 --> 00:51:11,106
from the current touch position
and add it to our map position.


976
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:13,086
And we do the same
thing for the list.


977
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,736
But in this case, we only
apply the translation


978
00:51:15,736 --> 00:51:20,146
to the y-coordinate because
we are just going up and down.


979
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:21,596
Quick look at how it looks like.


980
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:27,736
Cool, we can drag the map,
and we can scroll the list.


981
00:51:28,826 --> 00:51:29,976
Now, we have cheated a bit here.


982
00:51:30,496 --> 00:51:31,766
You can see a little
bit of inertia,


983
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:33,926
and we're also constraining
some movement


984
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:35,606
with some bit of
a spring behavior.


985
00:51:36,256 --> 00:51:37,666
If you're interested in that,


986
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:42,536
you can download our Xcode
project after this session.


987
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:43,376
Let's move on.


988
00:51:43,376 --> 00:51:50,216
I want to divert a little bit
to the part of our prototype


989
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:52,156
where we can share a toast.


990
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:54,856
So the idea is that you take
a picture of your toast,


991
00:51:54,856 --> 00:51:55,446
you add a little bit


992
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,546
of information, and
then you post it.


993
00:51:58,096 --> 00:52:00,826
First thing is I
need a camera view.


994
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:05,876
For now, I'll just hide it at
the lower edge of the screen.


995
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:07,356
And now, I need a button.


996
00:52:08,116 --> 00:52:11,516
But I realized Linda already
created a lovely Plus button


997
00:52:11,746 --> 00:52:12,816
in my navigation bar.


998
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,586
So what I do is, I
hook up a TouchUp event


999
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:19,066
onto my Navigation bar.


1000
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:21,576
And so, when you tap
that Plus button,


1001
00:52:22,146 --> 00:52:23,676
it will trigger this
line of code


1002
00:52:23,756 --> 00:52:25,626
which animates the
camera image back in.


1003
00:52:26,816 --> 00:52:29,816
And this is just an example
of how your code doesn't have


1004
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,006
to be beautiful, but you can
just hack things together


1005
00:52:33,006 --> 00:52:34,306
with what you've
got on the screen.


1006
00:52:34,306 --> 00:52:37,396
Here it is.


1007
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:41,586
Tap the Plus button, you
see the camera image.


1008
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:45,166
Now, you saw probably that
there was a live camera preview.


1009
00:52:46,346 --> 00:52:49,276
We added that to add a
little bit of realness to it.


1010
00:52:49,506 --> 00:52:50,336
But that's where we stop.


1011
00:52:50,856 --> 00:52:53,376
When you press or tap
the Shutter button,


1012
00:52:53,726 --> 00:52:56,006
we switch to a fake
image of a toast.


1013
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:59,846
And that's what we
continue with.


1014
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:06,086
You add a few information
about your toast and post it.


1015
00:53:08,026 --> 00:53:10,906
Now how did we do the
keyboard typing sequence?


1016
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,396
Probably already gave it away.


1017
00:53:16,906 --> 00:53:19,976
Of course, we just used
a sequence of images.


1018
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:22,031
[ Laughter ]


1019
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:24,836
I didn't bother about using
any dynamic text fields


1020
00:53:24,946 --> 00:53:26,606
or a keyboard sliding in.


1021
00:53:27,866 --> 00:53:30,716
I did all of these images just
from one slide in Keynote.


1022
00:53:31,816 --> 00:53:34,146
And this brings us back actually
to what we're actually doing.


1023
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:38,686
So, we're creating a prototype
by making pictures move


1024
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:39,906
in response to touches.


1025
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:45,236
And we're doing this to help
us make better decisions


1026
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:47,686
about whether we really
want to pursue an idea.


1027
00:53:48,946 --> 00:53:52,346
And part of this
decision making process is


1028
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:54,406
to show your prototype
to people.


1029
00:53:54,986 --> 00:53:58,386
And if it's an interactive
prototype, it's really important


1030
00:53:58,386 --> 00:54:00,196
that you let people
try it out with


1031
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,896
as little explanation
as possible.


1032
00:54:02,296 --> 00:54:03,996
The first impressions
are really important.


1033
00:54:04,426 --> 00:54:08,416
Look at where people are
struggling with the interactions


1034
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:12,326
that you created, and also
look at what delights them.


1035
00:54:13,456 --> 00:54:15,896
And ask some questions
like, "Do you know how


1036
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:17,976
to find nearby toast
or top toast?"


1037
00:54:19,106 --> 00:54:22,766
So value your feedback
is one which is critical.


1038
00:54:23,256 --> 00:54:25,106
"Is the toast on the map
and the list the same?"


1039
00:54:25,836 --> 00:54:27,736
This is something we
didn't really think


1040
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:31,316
about when we had our genius
idea of putting the map


1041
00:54:31,316 --> 00:54:33,146
and the list onto one screen.


1042
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:36,606
Something we should resolve
before we build the real thing.


1043
00:54:37,016 --> 00:54:39,976
"Is it easy to explore toasts?"


1044
00:54:40,516 --> 00:54:41,486
is another good question.


1045
00:54:42,986 --> 00:54:46,186
And ask for suggestions, "How
can we make this better?"


1046
00:54:47,056 --> 00:54:49,736
"I wish I could sort a toast
in a few more different ways."


1047
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:51,626
Yeah, it makes sense.


1048
00:54:51,776 --> 00:54:55,946
Not everyone wants to spend $4
or more for a slice of bread.


1049
00:54:57,316 --> 00:54:59,476
By this, I want to
reintroduce Jeff


1050
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:02,666
to summarize our
session and conclude it.


1051
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:03,046
Thank you.


1052
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:03,976
>> Thank you, Mark.


1053
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:08,546
[ Applause ]


1054
00:55:09,046 --> 00:55:10,526
So, we learned some
very important things


1055
00:55:10,526 --> 00:55:13,986
from Mark's interactive
prototype.


1056
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:16,866
Quick recap.


1057
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:18,056
Drew a bunch of pictures,


1058
00:55:19,326 --> 00:55:21,746
then we saw how the pictures
worked together using some


1059
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:25,086
animations, and then we built
an interactive prototype.


1060
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:27,636
So, we could see how the
whole thing worked together


1061
00:55:27,636 --> 00:55:28,176
in our hand.


1062
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:31,666
Now, a couple of quick
comparisons to hit this home.


1063
00:55:32,406 --> 00:55:35,086
This screen on the right
takes a lot of real code.


1064
00:55:35,856 --> 00:55:38,776
For our prototype, all we did
was move a picture around in 2D


1065
00:55:38,776 --> 00:55:39,966
and move a list up and down.


1066
00:55:40,356 --> 00:55:41,206
That was really quick.


1067
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:44,926
This grid view of toast
would've taken a whole bunch


1068
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:45,806
of real code.


1069
00:55:45,896 --> 00:55:48,776
For our prototype, we
just made a quick drawing,


1070
00:55:49,086 --> 00:55:51,806
which was enough to realize
that this concept sucked.


1071
00:55:53,056 --> 00:55:55,016
What have we learned today?


1072
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:57,726
Well, we prototyped with
pictures, and we learned how


1073
00:55:57,726 --> 00:56:00,186
to take screenshots, mask
them and rearrange them


1074
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:01,846
so we can make a lot
of different options.


1075
00:56:02,176 --> 00:56:06,266
We prototyped with
animations, and we learned how


1076
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:09,126
to animate pictures using
Magic Move and Keynote


1077
00:56:09,476 --> 00:56:11,566
so we could see how different
screens work together.


1078
00:56:11,986 --> 00:56:15,646
And, we prototyped
with interactions,


1079
00:56:15,826 --> 00:56:18,876
and we made pictures move on the
screen in response to touches


1080
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:21,276
so we could see how the
whole thing felt together.


1081
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:23,366
Why do we do this?


1082
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,126
Two reasons, hope
that you'll remember.


1083
00:56:25,576 --> 00:56:29,196
Number one is to test ideas, and
number two is to get new ideas.


1084
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:30,706
And how do we do it?


1085
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:32,386
This one I really hope
you guys remember.


1086
00:56:33,046 --> 00:56:37,686
Make fake apps, show people
and learn from their feedback.


1087
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:41,996
And do that over and over
again until the experience


1088
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:43,536
of your app feels great.


1089
00:56:44,086 --> 00:56:47,896
So here's what I want all
of you to go and do now.


1090
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,716
If you're a developer
at a company,


1091
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:52,456
I want you to tell
your management


1092
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,466
that prototyping
saves time and money


1093
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:57,966
by helping you build
the right things.


1094
00:56:58,156 --> 00:57:01,816
If you're a solo developer,
I want you to draw, animate


1095
00:57:01,816 --> 00:57:04,186
and hack before you go
and build something.


1096
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:07,516
And if you can't
code it all - again,


1097
00:57:07,516 --> 00:57:10,746
thank you for coming
- draw and animate.


1098
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:14,116
You don't need code yet, but the
person next to you might be able


1099
00:57:14,116 --> 00:57:14,936
to help you with that part.


1100
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:19,736
Designers, don't just draw
pictures, also make animated


1101
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:22,406
and interactive things to
fully understand your designs.


1102
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:27,266
And our management types,
please, go and make time


1103
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:29,676
for your designers and
engineers to prototype.


1104
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:32,216
Thank you.

There's a lot of
toasty code on the web.

Go check it out.

00:57:41,226 --> 00:57:42,396
Thank you very much everybody.
