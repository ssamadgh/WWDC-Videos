00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:26,716
>> Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in welcoming


3
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,276
on stage, Haben Girma.

00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:52,500
[ Applause ]


5
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,536
>> Good afternoon.


6
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:06,786
Thank for the introduction
Felice.


7
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:09,876
My name is Haben Girma.


8
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:14,166
I work as an accessibility
and inclusion advocate,


9
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,606
teaching organizations
and individuals to design


10
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:20,626
with accessibility in mind.


11
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:21,586
I'm deaf-blind.


12
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,626
Deaf-blindness encompasses
a wide spectrum


13
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,606
of vision and hearing loss.


14
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:32,126
I have a little bit of hearing,
and a little bit of vision.


15
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:36,406
I see maybe about 1% of what
the average sighted person sees.


16
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:41,936
By identifying as deaf-blind,
I'm telling the world


17
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,226
that I'm part of a community
where knowledge gained


18
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:51,246
through touch is equal in
value to knowledge gained


19
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:55,616
through sight, sound,
or other means.


20
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,876
Our world is incredibly diverse,
and when we design apps,


21
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,276
that celebrate that
diversity, and recognize


22
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:07,056
that diversity, we all benefit.


23
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:11,006
So I identify as
deaf-blind to tell the world


24
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:16,036
to design non-visual access
and non-auditory access


25
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:20,766
to help maximize communication.


26
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:25,606
This is tricky for some people.


27
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:28,366
One of my best friends,
when she first met me,


28
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,316
wasn't sure how to say hi.


29
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:32,886
She was sitting next to me,


30
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,316
in one of our classes
at law school.


31
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:39,206
And she waved hi, but
I couldn't see it.


32
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:46,086
And she voice hi, and
I couldn't hear it.


33
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:49,306
It was our first day of
international law class,


34
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,826
and she wasn't thinking
about international law.


35
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:57,686
She was thinking about
how to get my attention.


36
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:02,406
And after a while, during the
class, she came up with a plan.


37
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:05,996
She did the most logical
thing for a student.


38
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:09,986
She went onto Facebook and sent
me a message saying Hi, Haben,


39
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:12,996
I'm sitting right next to you.


40
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:17,346
Technology has facilitated
access communication


41
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,756
for a lot of people.


42
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:24,406
And when apps are designed
with accessibility in mind,


43
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,926
iMessages, mail, other
communication tools,


44
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:32,496
people with disabilities like
myself can use them and are able


45
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:34,556
to connect and share
information with people.


46
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:39,786
I saw that Facebook message my
friend sent later, and I reached


47
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:44,476
out to her and we were
able to communicate


48
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:50,216
and I explained the various
communication methods I use.


49
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,776
Technology facilitates
connections,


50
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:57,066
when both parties are
willing and interested


51
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:57,906
in practicing inclusion.


52
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:01,196
I want to share a photo,
that highlights some


53
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:04,316
of the communication
methods I use.


54
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:09,376
In this photo I'm standing
at a table, and I'm reading


55
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,706
from a digital Braille display.


56
00:04:12,216 --> 00:04:17,826
Digital Braille, comes through
a device with mechanical pins


57
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,245
that pop up to form
Braille letters.


58
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:24,536
And I read these letters
by feeling the dots.


59
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:28,856
Braille is a tool,
not a language.


60
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:34,156
I primarily use English Braille,
I can read Spanish Braille,


61
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:37,436
and I've seen Braille in
many different languages.


62
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:41,096
I was once on a ferry
going from Italy to Greece,


63
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:47,556
and I remembered feeling a bit
lost on the ferry because all


64
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:48,986
of the signs were
in Greek Braille.


65
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:55,416
So Braille is a tool and the
Braille display is a device


66
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,996
that produces this
information Braille.


67
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,816
Also in the photo, President
Obama is standing at the table


68
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,006
and he's typing on an
Apple wireless keyboard


69
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,176
and what's being
typed is being sent


70
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:10,446
to the digital Braille display.


71
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,046
I'm reading what's being typed


72
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:19,166
and this is a communication
method that I developed.


73
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,686
Deaf individuals have been
developing communication tools


74
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:25,516
for hundreds of years.


75
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:31,196
Communities around the world,
have developed sign languages.


76
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,796
In the United States,


77
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,136
the dominant sign language
is American Sign Language.


78
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:40,836
Which is heavily influenced
by French Sign Language.


79
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,716
My brother is deaf-blind.


80
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:50,476
And when he communicates with
me he uses sign language.


81
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,286
When he's signing I put
my hand over his hand,


82
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:57,196
and feel what he is signing.


83
00:05:57,366 --> 00:06:01,226
When he wants to listen to me,
he'll put his hand over my hand,


84
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,076
and feel what I'm signing.


85
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:08,276
Tactile sign language is
another form of communication


86
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:11,296
that has developed,
that has been developed


87
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:15,406
by the deaf-blind community.


88
00:06:15,446 --> 00:06:19,706
Another form is print on palm,
where people write on palms,


89
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:24,166
they could write in
English characters, Mandarin


90
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:26,226
and other forms of characters.


91
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:33,336
Humans are incredibly creative,
we design new ways for each


92
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:38,146
of us to connect and engage
and share information.


93
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,446
Another form of communication
is dance.


94
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:46,296
And dance is expressed
in many different forms.


95
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:51,576
Some deaf individuals who are
sighted will watch the other


96
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:54,376
dancers and will
pick up the beats


97
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,456
by watching the other dancers.


98
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:04,016
Other individuals will watch the
musicians, and pick up the beat


99
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:08,286
by watching the fingers and
instruments of the musicians.


100
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,526
People are very creative
and find solutions.


101
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:17,256
For me, dance is all
about the connection.


102
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,856
Salsa is like a kind
of sign language


103
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:25,736
and people communicate
information, rhythm, beat,


104
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:29,016
music, emotions,
through their hands.


105
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:33,966
Some of the signals
in salsa, are visual


106
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:37,886
and the people I dance with
will switch them around


107
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:42,386
and switch those visual
signals to physical signals.


108
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:48,746
Through dance we celebrate
joy, connection and community.


109
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,266
Communities that celebrate
diversity will find ways


110
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,796
to be inclusive,
they'll adapt strategies


111
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,386
to make sure everyone can
participate and be involved.


112
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:05,566
So dance is one community
in which I belong,


113
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:06,966
that practices inclusion.


114
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:10,506
When I join a community,


115
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,416
the first question people
usually ask me is how do


116
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:14,696
you communicate?


117
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,176
The second question
people usually ask me is,


118
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,926
have you heard of Helen Keller?


119
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,736
[Laughter]


120
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:27,116
Helen Keller was an
amazing advocate,


121
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:33,076
she lived from 1880 to 1968.


122
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:35,086
She advocated for
women's rights,


123
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,336
disability's rights,
worker's rights.


124
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:43,025
She spent her whole life
advocating, and yet many stories


125
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,446
of Helen reduce her
to one theme.


126
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:49,846
She succeeded despite
her disability.


127
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:53,166
Disability never
holds anyone back,


128
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,986
disability is not something
that people need to overcome.


129
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:01,536
The barriers that exist
are created by society.


130
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,796
And it's up to every single
one of us to work together


131
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,116
to remove those barriers.


132
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:12,066
Helen was successful because
she is part of communities


133
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,866
that chose to practice
inclusion.


134
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,426
She went to Radcliffe College,


135
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,316
and Radcliffe provided
books in Braille.


136
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,616
And made sure she
had interpreters.


137
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:25,036
They worked to ensure
access and inclusion.


138
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:29,306
Not every community
practices inclusion.


139
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,326
Harvard wouldn't admit Helen.


140
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:37,266
Back then Harvard
only admitted men.


141
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,716
Helen's disability
didn't hold her back,


142
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:46,276
her gender didn't hold her back,
it was the community of Harvard


143
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,976
that chose to deny
access to women.


144
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:54,666
As another example, Helen's
family would not allow her


145
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,436
to experience marriage.


146
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:01,126
Helen fell in love,
secretly got engaged,


147
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:05,626
but her family prevented her


148
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:07,736
from marrying the
person she loved.


149
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:12,396
Helen's disability didn't
stop her from feeling love.


150
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:15,446
She wrote extensively
about love.


151
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,996
But her family, her community,


152
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:23,336
chose to create insurmountable
barriers.


153
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:27,666
All the barriers that exist
are created by society.


154
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:33,466
Of members of society, we play a
role in removing those barriers


155
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,906
and making sure that everyone
can access information


156
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:39,546
and has access to opportunities.


157
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,756
We've come a long way
since Helen's time.


158
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:47,706
More and more communities
celebrate diverse families


159
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:48,336
and relationships.


160
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:52,336
Harvard eventually
made the smart decision


161
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,086
to open its doors to women.


162
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:59,776
And now technology
creates more opportunities


163
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,676
for people to connect.


164
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:06,376
I often wonder, what would
Helen have accomplished,


165
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,296
what freedom would she have
enjoyed, if she had access


166
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,186
to the world of apps
that were accessible


167
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:15,816
to people with disabilities?


168
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:21,376
One of the features
Apple offers,


169
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:24,296
for developers, is
called VoiceOver.


170
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:28,046
And VoiceOver is a
screen reader that,


171
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:32,606
when an app is compatible
with, will produce information


172
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:36,876
in speech or digital
Braille for users of the app.


173
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,996
I'm going to share a
demonstration video


174
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:40,546
that shows how VoiceOver works.


175
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:57,616
[ Applause ]


176
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,866
Apple has a variety of
accessibility features,


177
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:04,806
VoiceOver is one
which you just saw.


178
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:07,786
Another one, support
for Dynamic Type.


179
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:12,156
When you support Dynamic Type,
people who are low vision


180
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:17,306
and need larger font sizes can
have better access to your apps.


181
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,046
Another feature is Captioning.


182
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:23,216
Support for Captioning allows
individuals who are deaf or hard


183
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:26,586
of hearing, to access the
audio content of your videos.


184
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:32,066
Support for Assistive
Devices like Braille displays,


185
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:37,706
switch controls, switch
controls benefit individuals


186
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:38,986
with limited mobility.


187
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,866
So these are some of the
features that if you design


188
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:46,346
for your apps to be accessible,
will allow greater access


189
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:47,866
for people with disabilities.


190
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:53,406
But don't stop there, keep
innovating, keep thinking


191
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:56,136
of new ways for people to
access your information.


192
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:01,126
Our goal is to have a
world where all the apps


193
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:05,976
in the app store,
are accessible.


194
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,126
Right now if I need an app,
from anything from travel


195
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:12,376
to shopping, I need
to spend hours looking


196
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:14,066
for an accessible app.


197
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:17,706
And sometimes, there isn't
an accessible option.


198
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:21,136
Our goal is to have every app


199
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,976
and I mean every single
app to be accessible.


200
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:31,306
Several years ago, I went
to China for the first time,


201
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:34,956
and when I arrived in my hotel


202
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:38,746
in Beijing I did what I always
do when I get somewhere new.


203
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,856
I explored and while
exploring the room,


204
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:46,636
I discovered an unidentifiable
object.


205
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:50,396
It felt a little like
a piece of fruit,


206
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,456
but I've never seen
anything like it before.


207
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:57,976
I was wondering,
should I taste it?


208
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:00,076
[Laughter]


209
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:03,566
I was super curious to
find out what it was,


210
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,936
but not curious enough to taste
an unknown object [laughter].


211
00:16:10,376 --> 00:16:16,256
So instead I got out my camera,
on my iPhone, took a picture,


212
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:21,226
and texted it to a friend,
asking what on earth is this?


213
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:23,826
Is it safe to eat?


214
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:28,366
I learned that it
was dragon fruit.


215
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:33,956
And I discovered I
like dragon fruit.


216
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,966
Now imagine a lot
of people thinking,


217
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:38,646
why would a camera app
need to be accessible?


218
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:41,986
Why would blind people
ever take pictures?


219
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,626
We take pictures for the
same reasons sighted people


220
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,476
take pictures.


221
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:51,316
To capture moments, to share
experiences with friends.


222
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,016
Our goal is to make sure
all apps are accessible.


223
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:58,866
Try not to make assumptions
about what people


224
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:02,226
with disabilities
can and can't do.


225
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:03,546
Instead, strive for inclusion.


226
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:08,776
And after you strive for
inclusion for your apps,


227
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,606
here are a few things
to keep in mind.


228
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:15,896
It helps to plan for
accessibility from the start.


229
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,226
It's much easier, it
saves you resources.


230
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:22,616
If you plan for accessibility,
from the very start.


231
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:26,846
I'll give an example
from the physical world.


232
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,676
Imagine someone builds
a skyscraper


233
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:33,836
but realizes they forgot to put
an elevator, tears down part


234
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:37,046
of the building, and then
installs an elevator.


235
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:40,566
That's more time consuming
and drains resources,


236
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:43,946
it would be much
easier to just plan


237
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,756
for an elevator from the start.


238
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,046
Same principle applies
in the digital world.


239
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:51,426
You save yourself resources


240
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:53,906
when you can have accessibility
from the very start.


241
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,906
And there are engineers
with disabilities,


242
00:17:56,906 --> 00:18:01,116
designers with disabilities,
testers with disabilities,


243
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:02,646
to help you with the process.


244
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:06,966
There are all so many disability
organizations in the U.S.


245
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:11,996
and around the world, to
help provide feedback,


246
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:17,086
engage with us, from initial
design to app updates.


247
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,636
Apple also has a
lot of resources


248
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:21,876
to help you with this process.


249
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,816
Their online tutorials,
documentation,


250
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,586
accessibility guidelines
for iOS.


251
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:32,676
Tomorrow evening here, at WWDC,


252
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,926
we're going to have an
accessibility mixer come


253
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:38,486
and join us.


254
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,416
I'll be there to
answer questions,


255
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,806
lots of accessibility
people will be there,


256
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,596
including developers who've
gone through this process


257
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:49,866
of making sure their
apps are accessible.


258
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:55,376
So these are resources
that are available to you


259
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:59,296
and will help you design
apps that are accessible.


260
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:00,746
Accessibility benefits
your consumers,


261
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:03,326
but it also benefits you.


262
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:08,756
Accessibility has many
benefits for you because one,


263
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:12,756
people with disabilities are
the largest minority group.


264
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:16,536
About 1 in 5 Americans
lives with a disability.


265
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,486
So when you design with
accessibility in mind,


266
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:21,526
you get access to
more customers,


267
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,336
more people can benefit
from your services.


268
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:30,586
Another thing to keep in mind is
accessibility increases access


269
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,336
for everyone including
non-disabled users.


270
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:37,416
For example, when you
caption your videos,


271
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:42,486
and you add alternative
text to your images,


272
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:45,466
more text is associated
with your content.


273
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:53,406
And because of that, it's easier
for people to find your content


274
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,406
through powerful
keyword searches.


275
00:19:55,706 --> 00:20:00,896
The videos from WWDC are
captioned and those captions,


276
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:07,446
produce a transcript and
anyone can do a keyword search


277
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:12,746
and find exactly where in the
video a topic was discussed.


278
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,056
This is an example
of how a feature


279
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,566
that benefits the
deaf community,


280
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,506
also benefits the
greater community.


281
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:25,566
But the most important
point is innovation.


282
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,496
Disability drives innovation.


283
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:33,586
When you think about new ways
of accessing information,


284
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:40,516
new ways for people to connect,
and engage with each other,


285
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:44,646
you're going to find yourself
designing the next best thing.


286
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,776
Throughout our history
disability has sparked


287
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:54,076
innovation, that benefits
all of us today and many


288
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,776
of the products we use today,


289
00:20:56,776 --> 00:21:01,166
can be traced back
to disability.


290
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:05,406
In 1808, an Italian inventor
named Turri built one


291
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:07,416
of the first working
typewriters.


292
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:10,926
He wanted a solution
for producing print


293
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:13,636
that didn't require vision.


294
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:18,036
That someone can do by touch.


295
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:22,896
Now Turri had a lover who was
blind, and he wanted for her


296
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:26,206
to be able to write
him love letters.


297
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,416
So he designed the first, one
of the first working typewriters


298
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,526
as a possible solution.


299
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:37,166
And now today, around the world,
we have lots of touch typists,


300
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:41,286
lots of people who use
keyboards without using vision,


301
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:46,496
both sighted typists
and blind typists.


302
00:21:46,826 --> 00:21:50,356
More recently, one of the
fathers of the internet,


303
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:53,896
Vinton Cerf, is hard of hearing,


304
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:59,086
and his wife is also hearing
impaired, and they were looking


305
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:02,636
for a solution that would
allow them to communicate


306
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:06,486
without using hearing.


307
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:12,796
And to communicate from afar.


308
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,446
Disability drives innovation,


309
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:17,316
not just by non-disabled
inventors but by people


310
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,596
with disabilities as well.


311
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,926
Vinton ended up developing one
of the earliest email protocols,


312
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,756
and electronic mail
was one way for them


313
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:30,066
to communicate from afar.


314
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:34,216
And now, just about
everybody uses email,


315
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:36,526
and sends text messages.


316
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:42,066
Solutions designed with
disability in mind end


317
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,046
up benefiting the
entire community.


318
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:50,106
And central to innovation
is exploration.


319
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:55,896
I'm going to share a
photo of a jungle gym.


320
00:22:55,896 --> 00:23:00,636
And a jungle gym
highlights exploration.


321
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,736
There are multiple ways to get
to the top, there isn't a right


322
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,396
or wrong way to climb,
there isn't a right


323
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:10,576
or wrong path to take.


324
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:13,476
When I'm climbing I
can't see the ropes.


325
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:18,876
This is about, 20 feet tall,


326
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:23,156
it's a pyramid shaped
rope based jungle gym.


327
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:29,936
And when I climb, I reach out,
explore, until I find the ropes,


328
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:32,046
until I find the solution.


329
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:37,796
There are many, many, many
different ways to climb,


330
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:41,966
by touch, by sight, by sound.


331
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:44,996
You could have someone
down on the ground offering


332
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:45,666
voice guidance.


333
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,566
If you have a mobility
disability,


334
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:53,136
you can design an
assistive climbing device.


335
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,816
Exploration values
alternative techniques


336
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:59,916
and the more open you
are to seeing the world


337
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:04,886
in multiple perspectives,
the more likely you are going


338
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:08,686
to design, develop
the next big thing.


339
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:13,046
One area where we rarely
seek innovation is haptics.


340
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:16,386
And haptics is the concept


341
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,976
of communication
information through touch.


342
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,686
I have an Apple Watch,


343
00:24:23,356 --> 00:24:26,166
and it taps my wrist twice
when I get a message.


344
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:28,596
And that's a form


345
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:32,886
of communication based
on haptics, touch.


346
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:35,746
I recently went surfing,


347
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:41,226
and that whole experience
was about haptics.


348
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:47,336
Here's a photo of
me on a tandem board


349
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:49,556
and a tandem board
is a large board.


350
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:52,206
I'm standing near the front


351
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,966
and in the back is
the surf instructor,


352
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:58,266
Matt Allen from Maui
Surf Academy.


353
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,946
He was using tactile signals.


354
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:07,416
I could also feel the power
of the waves vibrating


355
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,226
through the surf board.


356
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:13,336
The wind, the sun,
the cold water.


357
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:17,646
Skin is our largest organ,


358
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:22,736
yet we've barely explored
the potential of haptics.


359
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:26,976
There's a lot of potential
at this intersection


360
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,646
of haptics and technology.


361
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:36,076
Keep exploring, keep
innovating, keep designing apps


362
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:39,246
that are going to increase
access for everyone.


363
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,386
And as you go through this,


364
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:44,266
engage with the disability
community,


365
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:49,656
plan for accessibility from
the start and design knowing


366
00:25:49,656 --> 00:25:50,716
that it's going to benefit you.


367
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:54,016
Thanks for listening everyone.


368
00:25:55,516 --> 00:26:01,500
