 ## Instructions

 This playground requires Swift 4. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 9 includes Swift 4 by default.

 You can also run it in Xcode 8.3, but you need to install a Swift 4 toolchain (don’t worry, it’s easy):

 1. Download [the latest Swift 4.0 snapshot from swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots).
 1. Run the installer to install the snapshot.
 1. In Xcode, go to _Xcode > Toolchains > Manage Toolchains…_ and select the snapshot:

    It might be a good idea to quit and relaunch Xcode after switching snapshots. I occasionally had problems with syntax highlighting and code completion that a relaunch fixed.
 
    If you want to switch between multiple Swift versions on the command line (e.g. to play with Swift 4 in the REPL or to build Swift packages with Swift 4, I recommend Kyle Fuller’s excellent [swiftenv](https://swiftenv.fuller.li/).
