These subtitle contents are provided by Apple, the original files are `Webvtt` format which is not a most frequently used format, so I fetch them from Apple website, then combine and translate them to `srt` format which is supported by most of video players.

Thanks to [Edward](https://github.com/eplt), he told me some of the videos in the WWDC apps had got English subtitles yesterday and he is paying close attention to this thing all the time.
