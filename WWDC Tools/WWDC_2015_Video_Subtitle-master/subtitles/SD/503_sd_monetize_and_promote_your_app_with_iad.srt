00:00:25,046 --> 00:00:25,516
>> CAROL TENG: Hello.


2
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:26,436
And welcome.


3
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:32,826
Many of you developers out there
pour all of your time, effort,


4
00:00:33,306 --> 00:00:36,166
blood, sweat, and tears
into building some


5
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,666
of the most amazing,


6
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,526
entertaining, and
beautiful apps.


7
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:46,236
The most successful developers,
however, don't just focus


8
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:48,476
on building great apps.


9
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,986
They also recognize
the importance


10
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:55,676
of building a great
business around their apps.


11
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:58,566
And that's what we are here
to talk to you about today.


12
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:00,966
My name is Carol Teng.


13
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:03,736
I will be joined by my
colleague, Shashank Phadke,


14
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,236
and we are from the iAd team.


15
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:10,496
Today we are here to
introduce you to iAd,


16
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:13,106
Apple's digital advertising
platform.


17
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,356
Whether you are a
large development house


18
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:21,206
or a small indie developer, iAd
has a wide range of solutions


19
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:23,286
to help you grow your business.


20
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:29,616
And some of the challenges that
all businesses face are how


21
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:33,666
to generate revenue and how to
attract and retain customers.


22
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,446
iAd has solutions for both.


23
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:41,876
To help generate
revenue, integrating iAd


24
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,176
into your app is simple.


25
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:46,196
And you can do this
with minimal code.


26
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:49,376
We will show you how,
later in the presentation.


27
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:54,186
Acquiring customers,
on the other hand,


28
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:57,016
can be especially daunting
for an app developer.


29
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,366
As you heard yesterday,


30
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:03,216
there are over 1.5 million
apps in the App Store.


31
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:07,236
And an average of 119
apps on a user's device.


32
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:11,766
That is a lot of competition
vying for users' attention.


33
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:15,166
So how do you help
your app get noticed?


34
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:19,666
For this, iAd has solutions


35
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,586
to help you efficiently promote
your app in the iOS ecosystem


36
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:27,316
to generate awareness for your
apps and acquire customers.


37
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:33,756
Promoting your app involves
three main concepts.


38
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:38,196
First, identifying and
segmenting your users


39
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:40,976
so you know who the
different audiences are


40
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:42,346
that you are trying to reach.


41
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:47,876
Engaging those users with
relevant and targeted messaging


42
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,616
in your app promotion campaigns,


43
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:52,516
and then measuring
the effectiveness


44
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:55,976
of those campaigns, so you
can continuously optimize


45
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:57,196
and improve the outcomes.


46
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:03,406
We will demonstrate how to
use tools and best practices


47
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:06,436
that enable you to
do both: monetize


48
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:09,966
and promote throughout your
app development lifecycle.


49
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:11,786
Let's get started.


50
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:17,006
Imagine that I'm
an app developer.


51
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,636
I have a few apps
in the App Store.


52
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:24,016
And I'm about to launch my
next great app, LiteRight.


53
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:29,306
LiteRight is a new camera app
with some super special filters


54
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,476
that aren't available
anywhere else.


55
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:36,036
It is going to be a free
app which gives users access


56
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:40,406
to a subset of those filters,
and in-app purchases allow users


57
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:43,176
to gain access to even
more incredible filters.


58
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,036
This is my app development
timeline,


59
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,246
which may look similar
to your own.


60
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:54,126
Starting with the design phase,
then I'll be developing the app,


61
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:57,616
launching it in the App Store,
and growing my user base.


62
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:02,286
I'm currently in the
design phase of LiteRight,


63
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:05,046
but I'm already thinking
about the business model


64
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:08,246
and how I'm going
to monetize my app.


65
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:12,116
Since LiteRight will be
a free app, I've decided


66
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:16,156
to make it ad-supported so I
can start generating revenue


67
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:16,716
right away.


68
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:23,156
And I've selected iAd as my
preferred advertising partner


69
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:28,006
to monetize my app because iAd
takes care of the whole process


70
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:33,206
of finding great advertisers,
serving the ads, reporting on


71
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:36,206
and billing for the
ads that run in my app.


72
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,086
And for that, iAd
shares 70 percent


73
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:42,816
of the revenue generated
directly with me.


74
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:46,646
And iAd isn't an
exclusive network.


75
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:48,956
So I can work with
other ad networks


76
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,986
and mediation partners
if I choose.


77
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:55,486
But because I'm trying to
maximize my revenue and I care


78
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:58,246
about premium, high quality ads,


79
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:00,896
I'm going to make
iAd my first call.


80
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:06,966
Because I've spent a lot of
time building a beautiful app,


81
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:09,966
the ads in my app should
be equally beautiful.


82
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,796
To achieve that,
iAd works with some


83
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:17,886
of the top creative agencies
to deliver rich, immersive,


84
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,946
high production value
ads from some


85
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,306
of the world's most
recognized brands.


86
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:28,356
In addition, every ad is
reviewed and certified


87
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:32,506
by the iAd team so I can be
sure that the ads appearing


88
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,576
in my app comply with
Apple's creative guidelines.


89
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:41,936
And I can block any unwanted ads
using key words and iTunes URLs.


90
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:46,166
And all of this contributes
to a great user experience.


91
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:52,556
LiteRight is going to be
a globally available app


92
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:56,766
which means my users will
be everywhere and so is iAd,


93
00:05:57,696 --> 00:06:01,916
with the ability to reach iOS
users in over 100 countries.


94
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:08,896
And speaking of my users, iAd's
solution is privacy conscious,


95
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:11,796
with built-in privacy controls.


96
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:15,756
That means my users'
data is highly secure


97
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:18,196
and is never shared
with third-parties,


98
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:20,626
which my users will appreciate.


99
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:23,436
It complies with
limit ad tracking,


100
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,866
and is automatically
managed by iAd,


101
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:28,966
due to a deep integration
with iOS.


102
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:36,026
And because iAd is built
into the iOS framework,


103
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:40,176
integrating it into my
app is quick and simple.


104
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:44,906
There are no additional
SDKs and no static libraries


105
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:47,326
or third-party headers
to clutter up my project.


106
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:50,846
I can be up and running
with minimal code.


107
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:54,596
Documentation and
sample code are available


108
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:55,726
to help me along the way.


109
00:06:56,276 --> 00:07:01,076
And here are all the ad
formats that iAd offers.


110
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:05,526
I can integrate one or more
of these ad formats depending


111
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:09,466
on what best complements my
app content and experience.


112
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:14,856
A banner, which typically
appears at the bottom


113
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:21,256
of the app, a medium rectangle
or M-rec which is good in-line


114
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:23,286
for content-heavy apps.


115
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:28,286
Pre-roll video that
are best for apps


116
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:30,006
that primarily deliver video.


117
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:35,716
And interstitial, for apps that
have good, logical transitions,


118
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,986
such as in games where
users are leveling up.


119
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:44,866
And coming soon, iAd will
support interstitial video,


120
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,566
another way to help further
increase monetization


121
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:53,906
for my app.


122
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:55,856
Now let's look at
how we integrate iAd


123
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:58,186
into my app, LiteRight.


124
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,656
For LiteRight, I'm going
to include banner ads


125
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,186
on the photo gallery screen,


126
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:08,096
and an interstitial every third
time a user shares a photo.


127
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:14,916
For the banner, I need to link
to the iAd framework and import,


128
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,986
include the iAd library
as part of my project.


129
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:22,426
Then I'll need to configure
the view controller,


130
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:24,986
such that wherever I
want a banner to appear,


131
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,586
I'll set 'can display
banner ads' to true.


132
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:31,806
And a good place to do this is
in the 'view did load' callback.


133
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:35,796
iAd will take care
of managing the view


134
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:38,506
such that the banner
animates in on screen


135
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,856
and collapses the frame
of my content accordingly.


136
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:46,606
And when I'm done, here is
what that might look like.


137
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:52,756
Unlike banners there's a
little more setup required


138
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,736
to prepare my app
for interstitials.


139
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:57,556
In my app delegate,


140
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,616
in the 'application
did finish launching


141
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:04,686
with options' callback, I need
to let the iAd server know


142
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:05,546
that my app is going


143
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,466
to be requesting an interstitial
via the 'prepare interstitial


144
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,136
ads' call.


145
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:16,496
And in the view controller,
just prior to the interstitial,


146
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,406
I can configure the presentation


147
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:21,216
so that the interstitial
will appear just before the


148
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:22,036
next screen.


149
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:26,686
A good place to do this is in
the 'prepare for segue' method.


150
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:31,066
iAd makes this simple.


151
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:35,186
All I need to do is set the
interstitial presentation policy


152
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:36,296
to automatic.


153
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:40,406
And this lets iAd manage the
presentation of interstitial ads


154
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:41,676
in the view controller.


155
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:47,226
And when I'm done I can see
what that will look like.


156
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:51,036
I have just shown you
how to integrate a banner


157
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:51,996
and interstitial,


158
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:55,226
but integrating the other ad
formats is just as simple,


159
00:09:56,386 --> 00:10:00,466
and iAd has tools to let me test
my integration so I can ensure


160
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,776
that I've implemented everything
correctly before I launch.


161
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:07,196
For some of you at this stage,


162
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,746
there may still be more
development work left


163
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:10,086
for your app.


164
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,386
But since I've taken the
time to integrate iAd early


165
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:17,236
into my development cycle,
I don't have to worry


166
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,046
about coming back
and doing it later.


167
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:22,906
And I can be generating
revenue as soon as I launch.


168
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,746
So now we've launched LiteRight.


169
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,536
It's live in the App Store.


170
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:35,866
Users are downloading
and using the app.


171
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,546
And ads are running in it based


172
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,166
on the integrations
I just showed you.


173
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:42,826
And here are examples of a
banner and an interstitial.


174
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:49,036
And I can see how much revenue
I'm generating from the ads


175
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:51,696
in my app by checking
the reporting portals


176
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:55,886
in iTunes Connect, or using
the new publisher reporting API


177
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:57,916
that is coming soon.


178
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:02,456
Because I've made the investment
to integrate iAd early


179
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:06,166
on in my dev cycle, it
is already paying off.


180
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,936
Now let's look at how to
make other smart investments


181
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:14,186
that will grow my
app install base.


182
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:20,456
So I'm earning the
steady stream of revenue


183
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:22,716
by showing ads in my app.


184
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,436
And some of you may choose
not to monetize your apps


185
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,246
in this way, which is okay.


186
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:31,546
All of you, however, probably
care about acquiring users


187
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:35,206
and driving downloads
and usage of your app.


188
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,526
And for that you
will need to invest


189
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:40,196
in actively promoting your app


190
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:43,206
which is what I plan
to do with LiteRight.


191
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:47,666
Part of my growth strategy is
to take some of the revenue


192
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,576
that I've earned from showing
ads in my app and reinvest it


193
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:54,436
in marketing efforts to
promote LiteRight in order


194
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:55,716
to expand my user base.


195
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,316
As more people discover,
download, and use my app,


196
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,376
that's more people engaging
with the ads in my app,


197
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:07,016
which further increases
monetization.


198
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:09,906
And this creates a
continuous cycle.


199
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:15,606
So I can monetize
or I can promote,


200
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,966
but experience has shown


201
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,056
that I'm the most
successful when I do both.


202
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:24,716
We just talked about how
to use iAd to monetize.


203
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:29,526
Now let's talk about how
to use iAd to promote


204
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,346
and drive growth for my app.


205
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:37,566
My plan to promote
LiteRight is two pronged.


206
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:43,786
First, I need to acquire
new users because with more


207
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:47,326
than 1.5 million apps in the
App Store I need some way


208
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:50,206
to make my app stand
out and be discovered.


209
00:12:50,776 --> 00:12:55,336
For that I'm going to actively
promote LiteRight and generate


210
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:57,126
that awareness for my app.


211
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,776
iAd has tools to help
me promote my app


212
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,856
without any additional code.


213
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,736
We'll show you how later
in the presentation.


214
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:09,106
And what I've learned
from my experience


215
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:12,306
with the other apps is
that I can't just focus


216
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:13,726
on acquiring new users.


217
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,056
I also need to engage
existing users


218
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:23,396
who have already downloaded
because one in four apps


219
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,696
that are downloaded
are never used.


220
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:31,026
And only 32 percent of users
who download an app continue


221
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:33,266
to use it after a week.


222
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:37,296
To effectively reengage
users who have downloaded,


223
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:40,516
I need to understand what
kind of users they are


224
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,356
so I can tailor my
marketing messaging


225
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,236
and target my ad
spend accordingly.


226
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:49,716
And for that I'll need
to segment my users based


227
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:52,106
on their behavior in my app.


228
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:56,076
iAd lets me create several
hundred audience segments,


229
00:13:57,266 --> 00:14:01,076
but to start I'll group my
users into two custom segments.


230
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,136
Dormant users, people
who have downloaded


231
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,536
but are no longer active.


232
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:10,196
For them I plan to
promote a special offer.


233
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:14,456
And a starter pack
purchaser segment.


234
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:17,496
These are users who have
purchased the filter starter


235
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:18,226
pack in my app.


236
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:22,626
For them I plan to promote
our platinum filter package.


237
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:26,776
To create a custom
audience segment,


238
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:30,266
let's look at how we integrate
the audience segmentation code


239
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:34,376
into my app as part of
the next update to my app.


240
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:37,266
And I'll use the starter pack
purchaser segment as my example.


241
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:44,356
First, I'll check to see
if users have purchased one


242
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:47,746
of my starter filters, which
means I want to add a them


243
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:50,776
to the starter pack
purchasers audience segment.


244
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:56,126
Then I need to get a
reference to the shared client.


245
00:14:57,436 --> 00:15:01,226
And next I'll need to tell
iAd which segment to add users


246
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:03,806
to by keeping track of the users


247
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:06,386
who have purchased my
starter filter pack.


248
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:12,356
I can do this by calling the
'add client to segments' method,


249
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:14,886
which takes two arguments.


250
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,376
The first is an array of
segment IDs which I got


251
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,016
from the iAd WorkBench tool.


252
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:26,026
If I attempt to send
some random segment IDs,


253
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:27,586
those will be ignored.


254
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:31,326
So I do have to get
these from iAd WorkBench.


255
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:36,736
And we'll show you where
later during the demo.


256
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:40,726
Second I'm going to set
'replace existing' to false.


257
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:43,176
Since I don't want
these users removed


258
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:48,376
from any other existing
segments they may already be in.


259
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:50,676
Now that I've done the
appropriate prep work


260
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:54,226
to segment my users,
I'm ready to execute


261
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,136
on my promotion plan
for LiteRight.


262
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,796
And for that I'll
use iAd WorkBench,


263
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:04,536
iAd's self-service
campaign management tool.


264
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:10,146
It gives me full control
to create, manage,


265
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,796
and optimize my app
promotion campaigns


266
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,456
and gives access
to full reporting.


267
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:22,396
Here you can see I've already
created a few campaigns


268
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:27,716
to execute on my promotional
plan to acquire new users


269
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:29,656
and to re-engage dormant users.


270
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:33,036
Next we'll use iAd WorkBench


271
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:37,066
to retarget my starter pack
purchaser audience segment


272
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:39,536
to promote my platinum
filter package.


273
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:43,436
For this campaign we are going
to drive users from the tap


274
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:47,476
of an ad directly into
the page in my app


275
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,716
where they can make
that in-app purchase.


276
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:53,566
And I'll hand it over to
Shashank for that demo.


277
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:59,696
[Applause]


278
00:17:00,196 --> 00:17:01,006
Thank you.


279
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:02,986
>> SHASHANK PHADKE:
Thanks, Carol.


280
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:05,136
Good morning, everybody.


281
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:07,705
My name is Shashank Phadke,
and I'm with the iAd team.


282
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:12,876
Today I'm going to show you two
awesome things in iAd WorkBench.


283
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,256
First I'm going to show
you where you can view


284
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,236
and manage your audience
segments.


285
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:23,136
And number two, I am going
to show you how easy it is


286
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:26,656
to create a retargeting
campaign using one


287
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:27,746
of those audience segments.


288
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:29,456
So let's get started.


289
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:42,046
When I log into iAd
WorkBench I see my dashboard.


290
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:48,016
This is where you see all your
campaigns across all your apps.


291
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:51,446
To view your audience segments,


292
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:55,676
you go to the 'my audiences'
page using the dropdown


293
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,516
on the right side of the page.


294
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,906
Here on the 'my audiences' page,


295
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,786
you see all the audience
segments


296
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:08,486
that you have defined
across your apps.


297
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,406
For every audience
segment you create,


298
00:18:12,946 --> 00:18:16,766
iAd WorkBench assigns
you a unique segment ID.


299
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,586
Like for example,


300
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:22,016
for my LiteRight
starter pack purchases,


301
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:25,576
this is the Segment ID
iAd WorkBench gave me.


302
00:18:26,796 --> 00:18:31,256
This is the ID you use in
your code to instrument


303
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:34,176
and start adding
users to that segment.


304
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:38,826
Because of that instrumentation
I can see that there are


305
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,266
about 10,000 plus users already


306
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:45,176
in my starter pack
purchases segment.


307
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:52,626
Now, of course this number
will keep on updating as more


308
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:56,186
and more users download
my starter pack.


309
00:18:57,576 --> 00:19:01,046
Now let's see how we
can use this segment


310
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:07,486
to create a retargeting campaign
for my new platinum filter pack.


311
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:14,436
To do that, I go back to
the dashboard and click


312
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:18,216
on the 'create campaign'
button to start the campaign.


313
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:25,386
I get to choose if I want to
promote an app or a product.


314
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,546
In this case I'm
promoting my app.


315
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,146
So I select "app."


316
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:33,556
As you can see, all my
apps are already listed.


317
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:36,656
I choose LiteRight
for this campaign.


318
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:41,706
Then I get to choose if I want
to promote and run this ad


319
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:45,456
on the app network
or on iTunes Radio.


320
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:51,266
I choose app network and I also
see that my ad will be running


321
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:57,146
in more than 100 countries
where I already support it.


322
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,376
Next I choose my bid type.


323
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:04,726
CPC, which is cost
per click, or CPM,


324
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:07,456
which is cost per
thousand impressions.


325
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:13,446
For this campaign, since I want
to pay only when the user clicks


326
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,546
on my banner, I will choose CPC.


327
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:21,256
Let's name this campaign.


328
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:25,456
LiteRight platinum campaign.


329
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:32,886
Next I see a list of
lines in the campaign.


330
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:34,386
I don't have any.


331
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,746
So let me show you what
it takes to create a line.


332
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:40,616
Click on the 'create
line' button.


333
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:46,906
First I choose which country
I want to run this ad.


334
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:53,046
I choose U.S. And now for my
platinum filter pack I want


335
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:55,936
to specifically target the users


336
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:58,456
who have already
downloaded my starter pack.


337
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:04,476
In this case I will select my
retargeting option to be 'yes.'


338
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:12,116
As you can see, all my audience
segments are listed over here.


339
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:16,036
This was the same view which we
saw in the 'my audiences' page.


340
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,976
For this campaign
I want to reach


341
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:22,586
out to this 10,000
plus LiteRight starter


342
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:23,556
pack purchases.


343
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:25,166
So I will select that.


344
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,266
In addition to the
audience segment,


345
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:32,896
I can choose other
targeting dimensions.


346
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,426
Like, for example, if
I want my ad to run


347
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:40,276
on specific devices,
iPhone or iPad.


348
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:46,756
Or I could choose different
U.S. or user geographies,


349
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:51,586
or I can have a dimension
of app channels,


350
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:54,626
which is the iTunes
category of the apps,


351
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:59,096
I want the ad to run on.


352
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:01,886
Or I could schedule my ad
to run on a particular time


353
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:05,796
of the day or days of the week.


354
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:08,476
After selecting all the
targeting dimensions I can see


355
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:12,976
that I can reach up to 10,000
plus users which is more


356
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:16,836
than the minimum 6,000 required
for a retargeting campaign.


357
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:20,056
So I'm good.


358
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,866
Next I choose my ad type.


359
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:23,636
It is going to be a banner.


360
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:26,496
And I'm going to choose
a destination type


361
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:27,986
of ad deep link.


362
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:31,436
I'll tell you about this
ad deep link destination


363
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:32,626
on the next screen.


364
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:36,976
I choose my flight
dates, let it be running


365
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:38,276
from tomorrow for a month.


366
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:42,796
And then for the campaign
I define my budget.


367
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:46,576
I would like to spend,
say, $3,000.


368
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:51,496
And then I put in my CPC bid.


369
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:54,016
Say, 50 cents.


370
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,676
Now, iAd is an auction-based
marketplace.


371
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,276
So I know for sure I
won't be paying any more


372
00:23:00,456 --> 00:23:01,586
than the 50 cents.


373
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:06,256
In fact, I could be paying less.


374
00:23:06,256 --> 00:23:13,096
Let's name the line.


375
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:19,226
Once I have defined the line on
the next screen, I see a list


376
00:23:19,226 --> 00:23:22,486
of all the lines I have
defined for this campaign.


377
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,876
You can define more
lines if you want,


378
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,726
but for now let's
leave it at one line.


379
00:23:29,246 --> 00:23:33,706
Click on "next" to
start creating your ad.


380
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:39,996
Now, to define an ad you are
going to define your pre-tap


381
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:41,706
and post-tap experience.


382
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:46,096
For my ad, I want it to be
a banner before tapping;


383
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:50,976
I want my ad to run on all
devices, iPhones, iPads,


384
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:52,426
so I will choose universal.


385
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:55,416
I choose my language.


386
00:23:56,056 --> 00:24:03,256
And for the creative, I can
use a standard set of templates


387
00:24:03,256 --> 00:24:07,296
that iAd WorkBench provides
me with various color schemes.


388
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:11,606
Or if I want I can upload
images from my desktop.


389
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:15,726
For now, let's quickly
use a standard template.


390
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:29,636
I can give it a title, a message
for my new platinum pack,


391
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:32,826
and a call to action text.


392
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:39,866
As you can see, I get to see
the preview of how this is going


393
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:42,226
to look on the devices.


394
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:45,216
In fact, I can get a preview
of how it is going to look


395
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,276
across all different devices.


396
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:54,806
Now I want to choose what the
post-tap experience I want


397
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:55,386
for the user.


398
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:59,506
I am going to choose
ad deep link.


399
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:02,756
Because in this case
for my platinum pack,


400
00:25:03,346 --> 00:25:07,116
every time the user clicks
on the banner, I want my app


401
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:12,156
to open up on the device
and take the user directly


402
00:25:12,316 --> 00:25:15,436
into the page where
they can do the purchase


403
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:19,866
of my platinum filter
pack, in-app purchase.


404
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:24,436
In order to configure that, I
need to put in a deep link URL.


405
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:32,556
I put in my custom scheme
and for filters, where I want


406
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:37,186
to go directly to the page where
I can do an in-app purchase


407
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:40,606
of the platinum filter pack.


408
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,986
Now, most of the time
my app will be installed


409
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:44,296
on the device of the user.


410
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:47,856
But for some reason if
the app is not installed


411
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:52,756
and after the user clicks on the
banner, I can take them directly


412
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:56,906
to the iTunes App Store
page to re-download the app.


413
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,076
Or if I want to take
them to another website


414
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:02,006
of my choosing, I
could do that, too.


415
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:10,046
For now I want to take
them to the download page.


416
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,886
I will name the destination.


417
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:14,746
LiteRight deep link.


418
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:18,956
I associate the line which
I created to this ad.


419
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:26,306
And name the ad.


420
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,816
Click "next."


421
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,366
On the next screen, you
get to see all the ads


422
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,116
that you have created
for this campaign.


423
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:38,656
We just created this ad.


424
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:42,416
Again, you could create
more ads if you want to.


425
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:47,016
But for now, let's
keep it at one.


426
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:50,516
Click "next" to see the
summary of all the campaign set


427
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:51,796
up you have done so far.


428
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:54,396
I can see the line I created.


429
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:57,726
I can see the ads which I
associated with the line.


430
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:02,136
I can also enter my
payment information.


431
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:05,216
Since iAd WorkBench, when
I signed up for that,


432
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:09,606
already has my credit card,
I'm going to use just that.


433
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:10,676
That's it.


434
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:17,236
At this point of time, I go
and submit this campaign.


435
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:19,026
Once you submit the campaign,


436
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:22,636
all the ads that
you have created go


437
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:24,296
through a certification process.


438
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,546
And once they are all approved,


439
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:31,186
and your line start
date is reached,


440
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:33,226
your campaign will start running


441
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:38,736
and your ads will start
serving on the devices.


442
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:41,276
Now, let me show you after
you created a campaign,


443
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:44,556
how do you monitor the
performance of your campaign?


444
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:50,516
I recently ran a similar
campaign which just finished.


445
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:55,086
So let me click on the analytics
section of the campaign card


446
00:27:55,736 --> 00:28:08,866
to go to the analytics, to
the analytics dashboard page.


447
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:15,186
Here you can see for the
campaign, various metrics.


448
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,376
The total spent, the
total impressions,


449
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:23,016
the total conversions,
all those things.


450
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:27,426
I can also slice and dice
this data by filtering


451
00:28:27,426 --> 00:28:28,946
by a particular date range.


452
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:33,336
Or I can view the data
at the campaign level


453
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:37,506
or at the line level,
even at the ad level


454
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,826
or the device type level.


455
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:46,406
In the graph which you see I can
plot a particular metric, like,


456
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:51,376
for example, the spend per day
across my campaign time period.


457
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:55,666
Or I can also overlay
with other metrics.


458
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:59,276
For example, impressions
over time.


459
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:03,236
Or taps over time.


460
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:07,116
If I prefer to do all the
slicing and dicing offline,


461
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:16,656
I can always download this data
using the download icon here.


462
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:18,646
All this UI functionality


463
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:25,586
and analytics reporting I can
also use the iAd's advertising


464
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,956
API if I prefer so.


465
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:31,616
There are so many other things
you can do with iAd WorkBench,


466
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:35,586
but for now I will
hand it back to Carol.


467
00:29:35,736 --> 00:29:35,946
Carol?


468
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:42,736
[Applause]


469
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:44,146
>> CAROL TENG: Thanks, Shashank.


470
00:29:44,146 --> 00:29:46,876
As you can see from that demo


471
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:50,656
of iAd WorkBench I have
full control to set up


472
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,606
and run campaigns
to promote my app


473
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:56,506
and in the reporting screens I
can see how well my campaigns


474
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:56,996
are doing.


475
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:01,036
Not only can I do this
inside of iAd WorkBench,


476
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:04,836
but I can also use
iAd's attribution API


477
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:08,326
to measure the effectiveness
and track app downloads


478
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:10,426
that originated from
iAd campaigns.


479
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:15,676
It is a method of the AD
client class called 'look


480
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:19,106
up ad conversion details,'
which returns two dates.


481
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:24,426
The first is the app download
date, which is the date


482
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:26,586
that the user downloaded
the app.


483
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:30,546
The second is the
last click date,


484
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:33,566
and this would be the last
date that the user clicked


485
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:37,726
on the ad prior to the
purchase of the app.


486
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,576
If both of these dates
are there and true,


487
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:44,686
that means this app download
is directly attributable


488
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:47,956
to the user interacting
with and clicking on an iAd


489
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:50,286
that is promoting my app.


490
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:53,896
So that's it.


491
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:57,886
Over this imaginary
journey of developing


492
00:30:57,886 --> 00:31:01,176
and launching the LiteRight
app, I hope you've seen how


493
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:03,606
to apply the best
practices of some


494
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:05,746
of the most successful
app developers.


495
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:11,476
Even as early as the design
phase, they are already thinking


496
00:31:11,476 --> 00:31:13,786
about the business model
and how they are going


497
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:15,866
to monetize their app.


498
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:20,786
And with just a few lines of
code, you saw how easy it was


499
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:22,776
to integrate iAd into your app


500
00:31:23,746 --> 00:31:27,316
and start generating revenue
even as early as launch.


501
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:33,236
Then we talked about the best
practices for growing your app


502
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:36,496
by investing wisely to
promote to your users,


503
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:41,196
how to instrument your app to
identify and segment your users


504
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:44,556
so you can better understand
the various audiences


505
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:45,696
that you are trying to address.


506
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:50,226
How to target them
with relevant messaging


507
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:52,326
and engaging ad experiences,


508
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:56,616
so your campaigns will be
more effective and efficient


509
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:59,246
at driving downloads
and in-app purchases.


510
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:02,826
And how to continuously monitor


511
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:06,156
and measure campaign
effectiveness using iAd


512
00:32:06,156 --> 00:32:08,546
WorkBench and the
attribution API.


513
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:15,536
These are all the reasons
that iAd is a great toolset


514
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:17,116
for every app developer.


515
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:20,936
It is easy to leverage
iAd wherever you are


516
00:32:20,936 --> 00:32:24,746
in your app development process
to impact the future success


517
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:27,166
of your app and just
as important,


518
00:32:27,536 --> 00:32:29,526
the future success
of your business.


519
00:32:30,106 --> 00:32:32,566
And one more thing.


520
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:36,846
For those of you who are
publishers of content


521
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:39,486
