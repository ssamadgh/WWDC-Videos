[ Applause and cheers ]

00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:21,676
>> In this session we're going


3
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:23,756
to discuss the best practices of


4
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:24,756
subscriptions.


5
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:26,776
We'll focus on effectively


6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,116
communicating the value of your


7
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,866
subscriptions, streamlining the


8
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,046
signup flow, and providing


9
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:34,856
positive and effortless


10
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,756
subscription experiences.


11
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:38,986
Lauren, back to you.


12
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:39,996
>> All right.


13
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:41,276
Thanks, Doug.


14
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:42,976
We're going to try this again.


15
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,331
[ Laugh ]


16
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,296
Subscriptions are the fastest


17
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:48,476
growing business model in the


18
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:49,026
App Store.


19
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,966
Why is it almost every time


20
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,446
you're ready to sign up for an


21
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:55,326
awesome new service or to


22
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:57,036
subscribe to some amazing new


23
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:59,526
content, this is the feeling


24
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,086
that you get?


25
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:02,336
That's because it's all too


26
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:04,396
common for subscriptions to feel


27
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:07,756
complicated, confusing, or just


28
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:09,986
take too long to sign up.


29
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,026
So, for a great user experience,


30
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,466
make your subscription


31
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:16,046
effortless, transparent, and


32
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:16,606
engaging.


33
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:18,526
Let's focus on each of these


34
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:19,996
principles to improve the user


35
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,476
experience and design for


36
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:22,426
subscription success.


37
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:26,416
The first step we'll talk about,


38
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:27,916
being effortless.


39
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,846
So what does it mean for your


40
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:31,156
subscription to be effortless?


41
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:33,146
It means that people should know


42
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:34,556
that you have a subscription.


43
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:36,936
That way they shouldn't have to


44
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:39,606
look for how to sign up.


45
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,766
So it's important to be visible.


46
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,956
Get out there and don't be shy.


47
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:45,806
Let people know that you have a


48
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,626
subscription offer, and ask them


49
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:48,916
to sign up.


50
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:50,896
One approach would be to persist


51
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:52,516
a Subscribe button in your app's


52
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:53,086
interface.


53
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,476
Here in "The New York Times"


54
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,566
they do a great job persisting a


55
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:58,476
Subscribe button.


56
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,446
And they do this tastefully


57
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:01,476
throughout the entire UI.


58
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,456
It's very visible.


59
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:05,216
And it's across each article.


60
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:07,576
This is done really well.


61
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,106
And it's not annoying or pushy,


62
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,016
because it families together


63
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:12,926
with their interface.


64
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:16,016
Don't present your subscription


65
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,446
like a popup add or a


66
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:18,306
notification.


67
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,976
Because popups and notifications


68
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,626
are intended to be dismissed.


69
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,216
And you don't want people to


70
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:25,716
dismiss your subscription offer.


71
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,986
Another way to present your


72
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:29,686
subscription would be to be


73
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:31,336
visible and present it when


74
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:32,996
someone has expressed interest


75
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,206
in a piece of content or in a


76
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,616
feature that you offer through a


77
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:37,746
subscription.


78
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,846
This is the dating app Her.


79
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,006
So let's just say you're swiping


80
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:45,226
through a few profiles and you


81
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:46,496
accidentally pass on somebody


82
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:46,986
who's cute.


83
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:48,876
So you attempt to rewind that


84
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,056
profile, and in that moment, the


85
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:53,226
app Her tastefully presents an


86
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:54,536
option for you to subscribe.


87
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,686
Because the rewind feature is


88
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:57,616
what they offer as a


89
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:58,356
subscription.


90
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,406
And this is great.


91
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:01,806
It's an appropriate time for Her


92
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,126
to present you with this offer


93
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:04,526
because you've shown interest.


94
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,796
Her does a wonderful job


95
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:07,976
presenting the values of your


96
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:09,876
subscription right here as well


97
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,806
with this beautiful, light


98
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:12,436
animation.


99
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,476
So whether you choose to make it


100
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:17,696
persistent in your user


101
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,866
interface, or present the option


102
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,666
to subscribe when someone has


103
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,186
expressed interest, make sure


104
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:26,876
that it is visible to people so


105
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:27,636
they know you have a


106
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:28,716
subscription.


107
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,236
And no matter what you choose,


108
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:33,286
all subscription apps should


109
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:35,136
include a place to sign up in


110
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:37,226
Settings or Accounts, because


111
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,046
it's a very intuitive place for


112
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:40,246
place for people to look to sign


113
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,483
up.


114
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:42,976
All right.


115
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:45,166
Also, to make your subscription


116
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,136
effortless, you need to remove


117
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:47,886
friction.


118
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:50,686
Friction is asking for too much


119
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:52,916
information, having too many


120
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,116
steps, and taking too much time


121
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,096
for somebody to sign up.


122
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,096
But how do you know when you've


123
00:03:58,096 --> 00:03:59,176
asked for too much?


124
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,316
This data should help.


125
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,986
This graph represents a snapshot


126
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,796
of one month of data from the


127
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:08,006
three top video streaming apps


128
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:09,266
in the US.


129
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:10,896
Now, while their names have been


130
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:13,086
removed, all the important data


131
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,446
here is the clicks to conversion


132
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:15,046
ratio.


133
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:18,755
A subscription flow that has


134
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:21,456
three clicks led to a 61%


135
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:22,216
conversion rate.


136
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:24,056
And a subscription flow with


137
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,576
four clicks led to a 48%


138
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:27,276
conversion rate.


139
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:29,436
However, as soon as there was


140
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,706
nine clicks, it dropped


141
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,846
significantly down to 7%.


142
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:34,696
Now, while this is just a


143
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,576
sample, it's clear that you


144
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,916
should only ask for what is


145
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,766
absolutely necessary for someone


146
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:40,386
to sign up.


147
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:43,596
Because quite literally, less is


148
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:43,986
more.


149
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,356
Less clicks, less friction, will


150
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:49,336
lead to more conversion and more


151
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,066
subscribers.


152
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:52,736
So focus on people on just


153
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:53,786
signing up first.


154
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,846
Things like favoriting,


155
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,876
personalization, and asking for


156
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:59,256
additional personal details can


157
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:01,076
all wait until after someone has


158
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,166
signed up.


159
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,756
So, by being visible, and


160
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:06,986
removing friction, your app


161
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:08,356
subscription will be effortless


162
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:09,726
and easier for people to


163
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,246
subscribe.


164
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:14,146
Next, let's talk about being


165
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,136
transparent with your


166
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:16,006
subscription.


167
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,576
Because transparency is the best


168
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:19,146
policy.


169
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,356
And you need to provide clear


170
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:23,856
terms so people understand what


171
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,906
they're signing up for.


172
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,696
Strive to be glance-able.


173
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,086
All in one view and in just a


174
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,756
few seconds, people should be


175
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:33,566
able to clearly understand what


176
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,316
your subscription offer is and


177
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,106
how to sign up.


178
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:37,966
So when you're making your


179
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,876
subscription, always include: a


180
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:43,566
concise value proposition, a


181
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,696
strong call to action, a place


182
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,426
for people to log in if they are


183
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:49,636
existing subscribers.


184
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,636
Also the ability to restore if


185
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:53,676
someone has a new device.


186
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,666
And a place to sign up that


187
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,716
includes clear pricing and


188
00:05:58,716 --> 00:05:59,216
terms.


189
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,906
And always offer multiple tiers.


190
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:03,456
Because you don't know if


191
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:04,886
somebody wants to sign up for a


192
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,626
day, a week, a month, or two


193
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:08,076
years.


194
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,596
So try offering three or four


195
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:12,656
different tiers to find out what


196
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,356
works best for your audience.


197
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,986
The MLB At Bat app does a great


198
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,006
job and offers all of this in


199
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,686
one easy-to-understand


200
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,886
glance-able view.


201
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,466
And this is important because


202
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,216
most of us are signing up on our


203
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:27,666
phones.


204
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,526
So please, keep it simple.


205
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,326
By providing clear terms, people


206
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,686
will be able to make an informed


207
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,446
decision on how to subscribe.


208
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:37,926
All right.


209
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:40,046
I saved the best for last.


210
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,316
Your app needs to be engaging


211
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:45,786
from the start, before people


212
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:46,396
subscribe.


213
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,446
And the best way to engage them


214
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:49,886
is through experience.


215
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,776
Let them experience your app and


216
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:54,616
your app's content before having


217
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:55,456
them subscribe.


218
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,786
Because being able to experience


219
00:06:57,786 --> 00:06:59,656
and try before you buy is a part


220
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:00,686
of how we make purchase


221
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,346
decisions today.


222
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,896
From trying on clothes to


223
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,696
attending an open house, or even


224
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:09,046
test driving a car before you


225
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:10,156
buy or lease it.


226
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,026
All of these are experiences


227
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,456
that you can do that help you


228
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:15,716
make a decision before you


229
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:16,086
purchase.


230
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,936
And the same applies for your


231
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:19,046
app.


232
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,756
There are three ways to engage


233
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:22,886
people through experience.


234
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,506
And it'll make it much easier


235
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:25,536
for them to subscribe.


236
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,516
First, you can offer a free


237
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,026
trial.


238
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,016
That way, people can try out the


239
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,996
entire app for free for a


240
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:33,756
limited time.


241
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:37,006
This works well for established


242
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:38,386
brands and when people have an


243
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,156
idea of what's included with the


244
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:40,896
subscription.


245
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,276
So, if you have an established


246
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,206
brand, a free trial is a great


247
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:46,766
way to let people engage with


248
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,186
your app and its contents before


249
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:49,856
they subscribe.


250
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:53,106
You can also make the majority


251
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,886
of your app available for free


252
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:57,026
and offer a premium feature as a


253
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:57,766
subscription.


254
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,056
For example, in the app Sleep


255
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:02,096
Cycle, you can use the entire


256
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:04,436
app for free, except the trends


257
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:07,026
feature shown here is what is


258
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:09,016
available to people who have


259
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:09,606
subscribed.


260
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,416
And Sleep Cycle makes it really


261
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,856
easy for people to sign up right


262
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,316
from here.


263
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,546
It's a great technique to offer


264
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,296
a peek of content behind this


265
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:18,766
blur.


266
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,466
That way potential subscribers


267
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,086
can see what kind of content


268
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,806
they would have access to if


269
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:25,916
they did subscribe.


270
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,726
And finally, you can allow


271
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,086
people to sample content.


272
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:32,936
It's a great way to engage


273
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:33,746
through experience.


274
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,076
And it works great for the


275
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:36,226
majority of apps.


276
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,135
This is "The New York Times."


277
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:40,486
And you're able to read ten


278
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:42,736
articles for free per month.


279
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:44,856
And this is a wonderful sampling


280
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,716
experience because "The New York


281
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:48,776
Times" lets people have control


282
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:50,386
over what content they're able


283
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:51,026
to sample.


284
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:53,306
That allows people to find the


285
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:54,476
content that they're interested


286
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:55,976
in and helps them better


287
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,466
understand the value of the


288
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:58,196
subscription.


289
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,276
The objective is to let people


290
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:03,186
experience and become familiar


291
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:04,836
with your app and its content.


292
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:06,806
And that will make it easier for


293
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:07,626
them to subscribe.


294
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,216
And no matter which option you


295
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,236
choose, make sure that it works


296
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:13,476
for your audience.


297
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:15,316
And you know them best.


298
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:17,166
Think about their current user


299
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,156
experience, the type of content


300
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,566
they have currently available in


301
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:22,366
your app, and how adding


302
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,716
subscriptions could impact that


303
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:24,366
experience.


304
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:27,326
So design your subscription to


305
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:29,306
be effortless by being visible


306
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:30,826
and reducing friction.


307
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,876
By being transparent with your


308
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,206
terms and pricing, and engaging


309
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,186
people through experiencing your


310
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:38,926
app and its rich contents.


311
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:41,746
That way it'll be really easy


312
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,526
for people to sign up.


313
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:43,956
Thank you.
