1
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:22,766
>> Whether you're a designer or


2
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,816
engineer, we all want our apps


3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,226
to look and feel amazing.


4
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,346
We want our code to be flawless,


5
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:30,096
our assets to be pixel perfect,


6
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,846
and our store ratings to be five


7
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:33,096
stars nothing less.


8
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:36,656
But let's talk about reality.


9
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:39,956
As a designer you're focused on


10
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,316
creating delightful interfaces


11
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:42,096
and experiences.


12
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:44,946
As an engineer you're focused on


13
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,386
making sure you code works and


14
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:47,156
nothing breaks.


15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,496
As a result the process becomes


16
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:51,126
slow and everyone feels


17
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:51,656
frustrated.


18
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:53,646
It's friction we don't need.


19
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:56,246
In the next 10 minutes we're


20
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,976
going to look at four things


21
00:00:58,276 --> 00:00:59,086
that will really help make


22
00:00:59,086 --> 00:00:59,596
difference.


23
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:00,966
So let's get started.


24
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,256
The first is using the same


25
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,885
terminology.


26
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:08,156
This saves time, eliminates


27
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,656
confusion, and increases


28
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:11,106
credibility with your team and


29
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:11,636
clients.


30
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:14,396
Let's look at some examples of


31
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:15,506
how using different terms


32
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:16,826
amongst team members can create


33
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,746
confusion down the road.


34
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:20,656
All right, pop quiz time.


35
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:22,356
By a show of hands, which of the


36
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:23,676
following is the right term for


37
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:26,276
this piece of UI -- Is it a


38
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:28,266
pop-up?


39
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:29,226
Popover? Modal?


40
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:31,536
Wow you guys are good.


41
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,706
And the right answer is none of


42
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:36,936
them.


43
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:40,366
The correct term is UI Alert


44
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,796
Controller or more currently


45
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:42,666
called an Alert.


46
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,476
All right, another show of


47
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:45,766
hands.


48
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,116
Which of the following is the


49
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:49,336
right term for this bar -- Is it


50
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:50,126
a Header?


51
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:54,606
Top Tool Bar?


52
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:55,976
Navigation Bar?


53
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:01,516
The actual term is Navigation


54
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:01,806
Bar.


55
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:05,756
All right and what do we call


56
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:06,436
this bar?


57
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,536
Is it a Drawer?


58
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:14,236
Tool Bar? Bottom Navigation Bar?


59
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:18,786
The right term is Tool Bar.


60
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,146
All right last one, show of


61
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:21,466
hands.


62
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:22,446
Which of the following is the


63
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:23,586
right term for this control?


64
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,146
Is it a Switch?


65
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,396
Is it a Toggle?


66
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:30,076
Is it a On-Off Slider?


67
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:34,056
No? The actual term would be


68
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:34,796
Switch.


69
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,976
So these are just some of the


70
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:38,906
elements that have been called


71
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:39,836
different things by different


72
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:40,186
people.


73
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,496
I am sure most of you have


74
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,956
experienced moments where you


75
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:43,986
have had a performance stream of


76
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:45,346
mental translations when someone


77
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,676
asks you to implement a Toggle


78
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:52,366
and the modal trigger a pop-up.


79
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,876
Adopting mutually understood


80
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,446
terminology is so important to


81
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:56,586
eliminating confusion and


82
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:57,256
frustration.


83
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,516
It's like you said cup, when you


84
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:00,796
really meant this kind of cup.


85
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,506
You want to agree on terminology


86
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,806
that doesn't require additional


87
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,016
brain cycles to interpret down


88
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:06,336
the road.


89
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,546
So here are some quick


90
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:09,846
activities that you can try with


91
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:10,836
your team to reach that goal.


92
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:14,436
Take 30 minutes with your team


93
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:15,386
or client to do an app


94
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:16,876
postmortem, just focusing on


95
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:17,346
terms.


96
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:19,736
Make it fun, turn it into a


97
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:20,456
Pictionary game.


98
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:23,636
Put things up on a whiteboard


99
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,176
and spend 20 seconds doing flash


100
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:25,826
reactions to it.


101
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,866
And for the more formal minded,


102
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:30,696
create a report showing all the


103
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:32,026
breakdowns due to terminology


104
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:32,526
confusion.


105
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:35,536
Developer to Apple.com is a


106
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:36,926
great resource for referencing


107
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,766
standard terminology whether in


108
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:40,206
the Human Interface Guidelines


109
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,356
or in the API Reference


110
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:42,136
Documentation.


111
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,116
All right, the second thing I


112
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:46,556
want to talk about is having one


113
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:47,186
source of truth.


114
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:49,716
Ever been in a situation where


115
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:50,776
you've had to pull mockups from


116
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,346
a server, stings from a Project


117
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:53,926
Wiki and then doing like a last


118
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:55,906
minute asset swap send via email


119
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:58,406
or coming back to an old project


120
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,296
and not knowing which is the


121
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:02,616
right version to open.


122
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:03,976
Hashtag designer life.


123
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:09,686
[ Audience Laughing ]


124
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,946
What if you and your team or


125
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:13,836
client could agree before hand a


126
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:15,116
single place where all of the


127
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,586
approved deliverables can be


128
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:17,086
accessed.


129
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:18,805
This would ensure that everyone


130
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,276
knows where to go to check out


131
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:21,136
the necessary assets.


132
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:23,996
Unfortunately designers don't


133
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,566
have similarly universal options


134
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,846
as engineers currently do with


135
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,116
their IDE's and Version Control.


136
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:31,106
There's an increasing number of


137
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,106
solutions that have come in the


138
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:32,936
last few years.


139
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:34,336
So work with your designers to


140
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:35,436
find one that integrates with


141
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:36,926
their tools and yours.


142
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:39,716
All right, thirdly I want to


143
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:40,636
talk about having very


144
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:41,566
thoughtful focus.


145
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:44,086
Let's be real.


146
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:45,606
There's an inherent desire to


147
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,516
start customizing your UI so you


148
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:48,196
can stand out from your


149
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:48,816
competition.


150
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:50,676
But have you stopped to consider


151
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:51,726
the big picture first?


152
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:54,836
When designing and developing an


153
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,416
app, you're creating a system


154
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:57,676
and systems have a lot of


155
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:59,036
complexity where everything is


156
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,696
interrelated and interdependent.


157
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,706
It requires all of us to think


158
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:05,916
deeply into all the use cases,


159
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:07,376
balancing that against your


160
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:10,286
time, skill, and other system


161
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:11,186
resource constraints.


162
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:13,406
It helps if you start from a


163
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:14,416
place of familiarity.


164
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:17,496
Just as most of you are more


165
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:18,696
familiar with cooking using a


166
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:20,016
non-stick pan, rather than


167
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,146
something more specialized like


168
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,976
a tandoor oven, starting with


169
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,466
standard patterns and resources


170
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:25,926
you get for free in the SDK


171
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,326
helps to speed up the entire


172
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:27,896
process.


173
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:30,716
Here's an example of a standard


174
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:31,066
table.


175
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:33,826
Starting with a standard table


176
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:35,216
view with this accompanying


177
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:36,566
disclosure indicator accessory,


178
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,076
would free up time to work on


179
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,336
ensuring that the implementation


180
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:39,866
is stable.


181
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,416
This also ensures that the app


182
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,936
will work with accessibility


183
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,516
features in the OS, which is a


184
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:47,226
huge plus for many people.


185
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:49,636
Then when you want to start


186
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:51,276
creating Custom UI, you'll be in


187
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,736
a more empathetic state of mind


188
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,376
to ask is it worth the effort?


189
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,906
Here are some activities I want


190
00:05:58,906 --> 00:06:00,056
you to do before going down any


191
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:00,906
path.


192
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:03,986
Thoroughly consider all the


193
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:05,446
intended and etch use cases.


194
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:06,606
Write them down.


195
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:08,666
Better yet do this together with


196
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:09,606
your team or client.


197
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:13,156
Find out what resources with the


198
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,386
OS or your tools that come for


199
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:15,986
free and leverage that as a


200
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:17,906
starting point and build


201
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,256
accessibility considerations up


202
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:20,596
front.


203
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:22,326
This will ensure even more


204
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,566
people can enjoy your app.


205
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,186
All right finally I want to talk


206
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,086
about show and tell.


207
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:33,236
Or rather show more than tell.


208
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:34,606
Designers can be guilty of


209
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,226
throwing static mockups inspects


210
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,506
over to engineers, especially in


211
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:38,206
a time crunch.


212
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:39,916
Or engineers can blindly


213
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,286
implement the specs without


214
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:42,306
seeking clarification.


215
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,106
Then when the app is being


216
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,326
reviewed by the team, there's


217
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,866
invariably complaints from the


218
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,026
designer that implementation


219
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:49,586
didn't match the intent, or


220
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:50,566
frustration from the engineer


221
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,306
that the spec wasn't detailed


222
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:53,386
enough to fill in the mental


223
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:53,836
gaps.


224
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:55,776
More often than not,


225
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:57,756
demonstrating with a video or a


226
00:06:57,756 --> 00:06:59,246
small interactive prototype can


227
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,566
be extremely valuable in


228
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,316
communicating the intent or


229
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,816
better yet, sparking a


230
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:05,346
conversation on constraints,


231
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,406
possible solutions, and next


232
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:07,796
steps.


233
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:10,516
Here's an example of an


234
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:11,916
animation spec for transitioning


235
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,186
into a full screen sketch on the


236
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:14,826
Notes app, the designer could be


237
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:15,796
delivering to an engineer.


238
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,566
Showing graphical


239
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,046
representations of the curves,


240
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,616
the related parameter value


241
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,826
pairs or better yet, the exact


242
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,306
API reference, coupled with a


243
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:26,856
video of the design animation


244
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:27,736
will ensure that the


245
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:28,996
implementation will certainly


246
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:29,676
match the intent.


247
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,866
Designers, you can do this.


248
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:34,526
There are powerful prototyping


249
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:35,886
tools out there like Principle,


250
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,356
Flinto, or even Apple Keynote


251
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:39,236
that are really easy to use, so


252
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:40,296
I highly encourage you to try


253
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:40,506
them.


254
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:42,786
And if you want to gain extra


255
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:43,996
credit ability of the engineer,


256
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:45,366
try using Xcode.


257
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:47,846
See how engineers use it to


258
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,206
bring your designs to life.


259
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,316
Diving in doesn't even require


260
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:51,836
any coding.


261
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:55,016
You can open Xcode, select any


262
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,606
app option, track your assets


263
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:59,016
into the asset catalog to see


264
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,646
for example how your app icons


265
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,466
will be implemented.


266
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:03,526
Or try the storyboard feature to


267
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:04,706
create simple flows.


268
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,816
Hint -- you can import your


269
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,066
static mockups in here to create


270
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:09,026
interactive prototypes.


271
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:12,026
Use the object liability to see


272
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,796
how built in controls work and


273
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:15,586
what they're really called.


274
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:20,146
And look at all these states and


275
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,126
properties for the table view


276
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,146
accessory that UI Kit is


277
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:26,296
providing for free.


278
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:27,846
Using the same tool helps build


279
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,916
empathy, keeps you informed, and


280
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,196
thereby build credibility.


281
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:32,846
It can also initiate


282
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,796
conversations that can be


283
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:34,996
helpful to improving the app


284
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:35,905
that you're both working on.


285
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:38,775
So here are some activities I


286
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:40,515
want you to try with your team.


287
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:43,196
Set short face-to-face times and


288
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:44,015
run through your prototypes with


289
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:44,416
each other.


290
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,946
Use that time to tweak values or


291
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,056
use the opportunity to explore


292
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:49,766
alternatives.


293
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,546
And schedule feedback sessions


294
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:53,696
while you're in context.


295
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:55,306
For example, grab your designer


296
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,816
or engineer teammate while your


297
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:58,276
project is still open and before


298
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,136
you're about to check in your


299
00:08:59,536 --> 00:08:59,656
work.


300
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:01,586
Quick timely communication


301
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,336
reduces errors and mitigates


302
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:04,906
potentially bad situations down


303
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:06,416
the road when your app is in


304
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,406
your users hands.


305
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:11,026
So in summary, here are the four


306
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:11,946
things to start working on --


307
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,776
agree on the same terminology,


308
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:17,836
decide on a single source where


309
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:19,086
everyone knows where to post and


310
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:21,876
check out deliverables, have a


311
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,696
thoughtful focus on use cases,


312
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:25,826
resource capabilities and


313
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:29,126
accessibility and demonstrating


314
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:30,576
with dynamic prototypes rather


315
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:31,756
than static screenshots.


316
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,106
Doing these four things will


317
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:34,986
really help with infective


318
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:35,726
communication.


319
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,676
You'll get clarity on what needs


320
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:38,996
to be done and you'll gain


321
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,196
credibility with your team,


322
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,236
client, and users.


323
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:43,516
Thank you.
