/*! Implements a single command line tool command
 *  \details This is an abstract class intended to be subclassed in order to implement 
 *      a subcommand within a command line tool.  You can subclass it directly, for a 
 *      simple command, or via the QComplexToolCommand subclass for commands that themselves  
 *      have subcommands.
 *
 *      To implement the simplest possible command:
 *
 *      1. subclass QToolCommand
 *
 *      2. override `+commandName` and `+commandUsagae` to describe the command
 *
 *      3. override `-runError:` to implement the command
 *
 *      To support options:
 *
 *      4. override `-commandOptions` to indicate the options you support
 *
 *      5. for each option, implement either a `-setOption_X` method or a 
 *          `-setOption_X_argument:` method, depending on whether the option takes an 
 *          argument or not
 *
 *      Finally, if appropriate:
 *
 *      6. override `+validateOptionsAndArguments:`, have the override call super, and 
 *          then, on return, check that the final options and arguments are self consistent
 *
 *  \warning This module is based on <x-man-page://3/getopt> and, as such, is only safe 
 *      to use from the main thread.

 *      saves the remaining arguments to the `arguments` property.  You may override this 
 *      to do special processing, for example, to check the argument count, handle inter-option 
 *      dependencies, or process subcommands.  It often makes sense for the override to call

 *      implementation throws.
 *
 *      This can't trigger a usage error because each option is specifically enabled via 
 *      `-commandOptions` and there's no argument that could be wrong.  Inter-option usage
