1
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:12,956
>> Hi everybody.


2
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:14,886
I'm Chris Espinosa from Apple.


3
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:16,406
We're going to have
a lot of fun today.


4
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,476
We're talking about
kids and apps.


5
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:22,186
Going to cover a few things,
going to talk about the history


6
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:24,856
of Apple and kids, how
we got where we are.


7
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:28,306
Some recent regulatory
activity worldwide


8
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,116
and in the U.S. that's
going to affect you


9
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:32,966
if you're vending apps
that are addressed to kids;


10
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:38,036
some new programs we've had
in the last year for Apple IDs


11
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:41,486
for kids under 13, both the
Student Apple ID program


12
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:43,726
and Family Sharing that
was introduced on Monday;


13
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:47,256
talk about your responsibilities
if you're selling apps


14
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:51,086
that are directed at kids; some
best practices for doing that;


15
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:54,066
and then a brief view about what
to do about other countries.


16
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:57,196
But first of all
a little history:


17
00:00:57,576 --> 00:00:59,736
Apple and kids go way back.


18
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:02,116
I personally know this,
because I was a kid


19
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:06,486
when I started working at
Apple on the Apple II in 1977.


20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,916
One of our first programs
was called Kids Can't Wait.


21
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:13,316
We've been getting
computers in front of kids


22
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:17,636
for almost 40 years, from the
Apple II through the iMac.


23
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:21,296
We had a huge influx of
kids into the ecosystem


24
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:24,796
with the iPod, the most
popular music playback device


25
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:26,046
in the history of man.


26
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,446
And now we've got a huge
number of kids both in homes


27
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:32,976
and in the schools using
our mobile devices.


28
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,216
Now, it was great
when we started out,


29
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:38,006
because it was a
fairly simple model.


30
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:40,876
Parents would buy a device
that was pretty expensive.


31
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,586
They would buy some
software at a store.


32
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,356
They would put it
on their device,


33
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,966
and their kids would use it
in their home or classroom,


34
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:52,216
and that was pretty easy
and it was pretty safe,


35
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:53,856
but it's a different world now.


36
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:57,416
It's different for kids, and
it's different for parents, too.


37
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:01,246
Kids are beset by a
world on the Internet


38
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,976
where there are millions
of strangers


39
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,806
out there they can have
instantaneous contact with,


40
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:08,406
both other kids and grownups.


41
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:11,936
And there's also billions
of dollars of marketing


42
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:16,236
and merchandising that are aimed
at those kids, and that's why


43
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,136
around the world
people are working


44
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,196
on legislation to protect kids.


45
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,926
Now, we've been doing some
things gradually through OS X


46
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:29,336
and through iOS to give
parents and kids some protection


47
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,356
in the use of technology.


48
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,396
The parental controls that
have been in OS X forever


49
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:43,976
and the restrictions on iOS will
really help parents configure


50
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:47,246
the device to work the way they
want it to work with their kids,


51
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:50,006
and as app developers you're
kind of accustomed to this.


52
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,286
Sometimes, as in the
previous session,


53
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,526
when you go to use a
restricted data class,


54
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,196
it just won't be available,


55
00:02:57,196 --> 00:03:00,036
because there's been a parental
control set on that device.


56
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:03,446
So, you're accustomed to dealing
with that as app developers.


57
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,986
And then when we start
putting networked capabilities


58
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:13,066
in the hands of users, we're
making some accommodations


59
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:16,286
to do things that are
specifically directed for kids,


60
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,606
Game Center for example.


61
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:21,636
We knew that a lot of kids
would be using Game Center


62
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:22,946
on their parent's devices,


63
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,846
and so we let them have
their own handles regardless


64
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:26,506
of their age.


65
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,686
They're more or less anonymous.


66
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,036
We don't collect
personal information.


67
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:33,666
We don't allow chat
for Game Center handles


68
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,956
for kids under 13.


69
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:36,456
There is no ads.


70
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,856
It's generic screen names.


71
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,786
There's no image sharing.


72
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:43,066
The chat messages they can
use are canned messages only,


73
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,196
not free-form chat.


74
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:47,656
So, we've created some, you
know, little cul-de-sacs


75
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:50,486
of functionality
for kids under 13.


76
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:55,686
There is a new kid's
category in the App Store


77
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:56,666
that you may have heard about.


78
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,556
You can go in the App
Store guidelines or go


79
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,016
to the App Store
sessions or labs


80
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:01,506
and learn a little
bit more about these.


81
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,916
If you're targeting your
apps to sell to the parents


82
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:08,566
of young kids who are going
to use them, there's a couple


83
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,196
of things you need to do
to get into that category.


84
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,786
You have to have a privacy
policy on your page,


85
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:18,055
and you've got to link to that
privacy policy on your app page.


86
00:04:18,386 --> 00:04:21,666
You cannot have
behavioral-oriented advertising.


87
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:23,566
You can have contextual
advertising,


88
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,586
but not behavioral-oriented
advertising


89
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:27,036
that tracks your kid.


90
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:31,606
You can do no tracking
across sites or across apps.


91
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,926
The contextual ads must
be appropriate for kids,


92
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:37,426
and you've got to
have a parental gate


93
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:40,146
on your app before you
get out of the app to go


94
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:44,846
to In-App Purchases back to the
App Store or to any online site.


95
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:48,146
So again, little
cul-de-sacs of functionality


96
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:50,776
to accommodate kids
using our technology.


97
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:56,046
But there is a lot going on
in the world and a lot going


98
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,676
on in the United States about
what technology companies,


99
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,516
Internet companies in
general have to do about kids


100
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:07,606
to give parents the safety
and control they want.


101
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:09,856
Generally it's about
being sensitive


102
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:12,556
to the needs of parents
and kids.


103
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,646
But, some areas that
we've gotten scrutiny


104
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,216
and you may have
gotten scrutiny,


105
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:21,596
including not being clear
about the total cost of an app.


106
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,496
A free app that may
cost hundreds of dollars


107
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:26,506
in In-App Purchases in order


108
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:30,136
to have a good play
experience is going


109
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:32,236
to be considered a
little out of line.


110
00:05:32,336 --> 00:05:33,586
You may need to look at that.


111
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:36,186
Aggressive exhortations to buy,


112
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:39,226
where you are constantly
bombarded with the urge


113
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:42,246
to spend money, that's not
going to be OK for some


114
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:44,436
of the regulatory
agencies, and you may have


115
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:45,836
to be careful about
some of these.


116
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:49,086
You're responsible for
local law compliance.


117
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:51,546
There are some principles
that you can follow.


118
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,256
The British government
has put some together.


119
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:54,646
There's a link on this website.


120
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,246
You can go back to
the tape and read it.


121
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,936
There's some general principles
about dealing with kids


122
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:03,066
in websites and in apps that are
really, really good to follow.


123
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,976
Now, at this point I want to
go off script a little bit.


124
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:13,226
I want you on a lot of these
slides to be thinking I'm going


125
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:14,846
to call my lawyer, OK?


126
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:16,646
So, we're going to take
a practice right now.


127
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,406
I want you to just
think to yourself,


128
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,196
I want to call my
lawyer, one, two, three.


129
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,736
>> I want to call my lawyer.


130
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:25,536
>> OK, that was good.


131
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:26,756
That wasn't just
thinking to yourself.


132
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:27,376
That was allowed.


133
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:28,856
I want to hear that.


134
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,576
Maybe we could up the volume


135
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:32,806
on that a little bit,
so one, two, three.


136
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:34,416
>> [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.


137
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,066
>> OK, that's pretty good.


138
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:40,636
Now, in the room next door I
have been told there's going


139
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:43,356
to be some loud music playing
that may disturb our session.


140
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:46,746
And my lawyer on this
project is in that room.


141
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,566
I want her to hear this, OK,
so loud enough for Russian Hill


142
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,756
to hear, one, two, three.


143
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:55,886
>> [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.


144
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:56,956
>> Aw, that's awesome people.


145
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:57,636
OK, thanks.


146
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:58,266
Remember that.


147
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,196
We're going to do that later.


148
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:02,546
The thing that's going
to affect you most


149
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:07,176
as developers is the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act


150
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,426
of 2000, OK.


151
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:12,756
This was originally
written to focus


152
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:15,356
on websites and online services.


153
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:19,106
It applies to sites
that are directed at


154
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:24,196
or have actual knowledge of
use by kids under age 13,


155
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:25,816
and it restricts you


156
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:28,086
from collecting identifying
information


157
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,936
without parental consent.


158
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:33,586
Pretty straightforward as
it goes as it was in 2000,


159
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,996
but a lot has happened
since 2000.


160
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:38,096
The way the law was
originally written was


161
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,246
that you couldn't collect
the first or last name,


162
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:43,836
the email address or phone
number, any physical address,


163
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:47,196
street name or the name of a
city or a town, Social Security,


164
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:50,986
user identifier, any screen
name that would have a way


165
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:55,206
of contacting the kid, or
information that combines


166
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:56,276
with any of those above.


167
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:59,556
And it defined an
acceptable mechanism


168
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,896
to get parental consent.


169
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:07,476
Well, last year in 2013,
the Federal Trade Commission


170
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:10,466
in the United States revised
that act to clarify it,


171
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,136
expand it a little bit,


172
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:14,896
and these are the things you'll
really need to careful about.


173
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:17,876
They clarified that everything
that applied to websites


174
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,676
in 2000 applies to mobile, too.


175
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:23,056
So, all of your apps
are affected.


176
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:26,016
They expanded the definition
of personal information


177
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:29,166
that requires parental consent
according the new capabilities


178
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:30,446
of mobile devices.


179
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:36,296
So, any photo or video or sound
recording that your app makes


180
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:41,606
that could include the
child's own image is subject


181
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:43,486
to the COPPA regulations, OK,


182
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,226
very important for
you to know that.


183
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,996
Geolocation that can isolate
the kid's location to a city


184
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:52,926
or town - subject to COPPA
regulations, any screen name


185
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:54,956
or identifier that can
be used for contact,


186
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:58,056
that's pretty much the same,
or a persistent identifier


187
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:00,746
that identifies them
across sites or services.


188
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:05,186
If you're using this information
solely within your app


189
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,806
and solely for internal
functionality


190
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,906
to your app, that's OK.


191
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,146
But, if it goes up on a website,
if it goes outside your app,


192
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:15,156
if you're using it
for purposes other


193
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:18,506
than just making your app
work, then you're subject


194
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:19,706
to the requirements


195
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,916
of the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act.


196
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:27,866
And there are some requirements
of that, and we're going


197
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,176
to go into that later.


198
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:32,986
Now, kids under 13
who are subject


199
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,316
to the COPPA law have Apple IDs.


200
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,566
They have it in two ways.


201
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,746
The first is an Apple
ID for Students Program,


202
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,606
and this is what we
rolled out last year.


203
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,666
It's a program that gets
verified parental consent


204
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,466
through the COPPA law
through schools, OK.


205
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:51,266
We've rolled it out in several
large school districts starting


206
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,826
last year and going
into this year,


207
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:57,646
and they're full-fledged Apple
IDs for iCloud and iTunes.


208
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,926
They're not these
Game Center accounts.


209
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:01,016
They're not kid accounts.


210
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,076
They're not junior accounts.


211
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,956
They really are full
accounts, OK.


212
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:07,486
There are a couple of little
things we've applied to them.


213
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:10,566
Students do not receive
marketing materials from Apple.


214
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,476
That box is implicitly checked


215
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,026
to not receive marketing
materials,


216
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,686
and the Limit Ad Tracking
switch is automatically set


217
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:19,556
for accounts for kids under 13.


218
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:22,826
Now, this is really
only for, you know,


219
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:25,036
a few tens of thousands
of kids now.


220
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:26,416
And of course, we're
going to expand


221
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,436
that in more school districts.


222
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:31,326
But, what we announced
Monday is much bigger,


223
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:33,156
and that's Family Sharing.


224
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:38,376
Family Sharing is a method to
get verifiable parental consent


225
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:43,166
under the COPPA law for any
family in the U.S., and in fact,


226
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,236
we're using the same
mechanism worldwide for parents


227
00:10:47,236 --> 00:10:50,206
to create Apple IDs
for young kids.


228
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:54,076
It integrates with the Ask
To Buy feature that you saw


229
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:57,776
on Monday, so that
parents can see and approve


230
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,666
of purchases by their kids.


231
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,826
Once again, just
like the student IDs,


232
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,666
they're full-fledged Apple
IDs for iCloud and iTunes.


233
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,706
The same switches are set, no
marketing and no ad tracking,


234
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:11,236
and the verified
parental consent is set


235
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:12,426
up by a special mechanism.


236
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:16,316
So it's a way for us to get
the parents to create accounts


237
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:20,146
for kids under 13 and then
bring them into the family,


238
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:22,346
let them share existing
purchases


239
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:23,546
and make new purchases.


240
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:25,916
Let me walk you a little bit


241
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,146
through how the whole
Family Sharing program works


242
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,886
because that'll give you
a good background for it.


243
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:33,906
You start with the person
who has a payment method


244
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:38,436
and an Apple ID who decides
to be a family organizer.


245
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,856
And the family organizer can add


246
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:45,576
or invite other existing
accounts into the family


247
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,726
and share their payment method


248
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,776
and share their existing
purchases with them.


249
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:55,986
They can also create new
accounts for kids under 13


250
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:58,276
and create a family circle.


251
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,676
That can be up to
six accounts total.


252
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:03,476
And the requirement is
that during the life


253
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:05,206
of the family all
the accounts have


254
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,656
to use the family
organizer's payment method


255
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:10,756
or credit card, OK.


256
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:14,696
The way Purchase Sharing works
is that you have this bucket


257
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:18,696
of purchases that you've made,
and that is made available


258
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:20,596
to everybody in your family.


259
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:24,596
They can see all of your
movies, books and apps that -


260
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,216
and songs that you
have purchased.


261
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:29,846
They can pick one out of your
purchases and re-download it


262
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:32,706
to their device as if it was
in their purchase history.


263
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,236
It's not their title now.


264
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,836
It doesn't show up in
their purchase history.


265
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:39,116
It's still yours, and then
if you leave the family,


266
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:41,056
they lose the rights
to that title.


267
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:45,126
And then the Ask To Buy
capability is really cool.


268
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:49,126
If one of your family members
has the Ask To Buy switch turned


269
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,566
on and is shopping in any
of the stores and wants


270
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:55,006
to purchase something, at time


271
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:59,406
of purchase request a
notification is sent


272
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:03,366
to the organizer and other
parents in the family saying


273
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,466
that this person wants
to buy this product


274
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:06,776
with a link to the product page.


275
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:09,126
And the organizer
and the parents


276
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:13,846
or guardians get the option to
approve or deny that request.


277
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:18,696
And on approval, they
complete that purchase.


278
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:22,486
Now, this is going to affect the
way your In-App Purchases work,


279
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:26,236
because there may be a
long time between the time


280
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:29,276
when the user taps the
In-App Purchase Buy button


281
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:33,396
and when the parent
actually sees it, taps OK,


282
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:35,706
the request comes back
and they get to buy that.


283
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:37,916
Go back and look
at James Wilson's


284
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:40,746
"Optimizing StoreKit
Transaction" session.


285
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,466
There was one given yesterday


286
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,076
and he's reprising
it tomorrow morning.


287
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,706
See that. He's got some
great tips for how to deal


288
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,486
with that in your app.


289
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,536
So, given all of that,
what does this mean to you?


290
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:55,206
What does regulatory
environment mean to you?


291
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,706
What do the new under
13 accounts mean to you?


292
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:01,606
What is Ask To Buy and
Family Sharing mean to you?


293
00:14:02,326 --> 00:14:05,736
And at this time
I want you to say-


294
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,746
>> [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.


295
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:09,716
>> Oh come on, come on, come on.


296
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,366
One, two, three.


297
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,216
>> [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.


298
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:13,096
>> Great. OK.


299
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:17,096
Only your lawyer can tell
you what this means to you


300
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,536
in the context of your
app and your company.


301
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,626
But, the thing you got
to know is that kids


302
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:25,006
under 13 may be buying,
selling, buying,


303
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,896
sharing and using your apps.


304
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:32,106
So, you've got to tell whether
your apps are directed at kids


305
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:36,966
under 13 or whether you have
specific knowledge that kids


306
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:38,336
under 13 are using your apps.


307
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:42,176
If you've got a general-purpose
app like a word processor


308
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:45,526
or a to-do list reminder,
you're not targeted at kids,


309
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:47,946
you're not in the kids
section of the store,


310
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:52,206
you don't ask their age
anywhere - you're probably OK


311
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:55,616
under the COPPA law, which only
affects things that are directed


312
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:59,146
at or you have actual
knowledge of the user's age.


313
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:01,936
Again, you have to consult
your lawyer in order


314
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,006
to know whether you do or do
not follow- fall under the law.


315
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,886
But, typically, if you
have a general-purpose app,


316
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:10,776
you don't market to kids,
you're not in the kids section,


317
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:14,196
you don't know the age,
then you don't have to worry


318
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,676
about COPPA conformance
specifically.


319
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:22,056
But, if your app is directed
at kids, which it probably is


320
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:26,246
if you're in this room, you
have some implementation choices


321
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:30,756
to either avoid requirements
for conformance with COPPA


322
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,156
or to conform with
the COPPA law.


323
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,126
And there three basic
approaches, and I'm going


324
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,316
to walk you through them now.


325
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:39,416
You can either avoid
doing the things


326
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,106
that subject you to
COPPA regulation.


327
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:42,236
Just stay out of it.


328
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:44,646
Do not collect personally
identifying information -


329
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,656
it's a great alternative.


330
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,436
Or you can choose to
collect the information


331
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:53,536
of how old the user is and
present a forked experience,


332
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,766
different experiences for
kids over 13 and under 13,


333
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,716
disable the personally
identifying information


334
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:03,756
experience for the
kids under 13.


335
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,896
That's a viable choice.


336
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,346
That's a good choice
for you to make.


337
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:13,326
Or, you can, if you're all about
that information, if you're all


338
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:15,536
about video, if you're all
about chat, if you're all


339
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:19,836
about sharing stuff, you really
need to address kids under 13


340
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:23,236
with the full features of your
application, then you have


341
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:27,046
to get verifiable parental
consent of the use -


342
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,796
from the user's parents before
you can proceed with the app,


343
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,716
and we'll lead you through
some steps to do that.


344
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:39,146
So, let's look at the first
alternative, avoid it.


345
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:42,996
This is pretty easy
for most apps.


346
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,836
Don't collect personally
identifying information.


347
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,476
Don't show behaviorally
targeted ads,


348
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:49,886
although contextual
ads are fine.


349
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:52,006
Don't support photos.


350
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,426
Don't support voice recording.


351
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:56,526
Don't support social networking.


352
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,136
Don't support finding
your location.


353
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,216
Don't support your
own push notifications


354
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:04,646
or any other COPPA-regulated
functionality.


355
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,506
You can go a long way
actually without doing those


356
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,846
if that's what your app is
about, if it's a simple game


357
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:11,486
or a general purpose
application.


358
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:15,796
Ask To Buy does not make
you COPPA compliant.


359
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,006
Getting the parental
permission to purchase


360
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:22,066
and download the game is
not COPPA compliant parental


361
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:23,796
notification and consent


362
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,246
to collect personally
identifying information.


363
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:29,186
So, just because the kid bought
your game through Ask To Buy,


364
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,726
that doesn't let
you off the hook.


365
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,346
If you limit yourself to
what Game Center does,


366
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,666
you're generally good, but
you got to check your app


367
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,216
and make sure that you're not
doing any of these things.


368
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:44,936
If you saw the previous
presentation, then you know


369
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:47,426
that there are some
protected data classes


370
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:50,196
in both platforms, iOS and OS X.


371
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,836
If you look at those
protected data classes,


372
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:56,166
this gives you a really good
idea of whether you're going


373
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,346
to be generally compliant
with COPPA or not.


374
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:03,866
If you're using location or
contacts or photos or microphone


375
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:08,416
or the worldwide or the
camera or social or HealthKit,


376
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:12,326
you are subject to COPPA
regulations, and you need


377
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:13,166
to be careful about that.


378
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,576
Even Bluetooth, because
Bluetooth has a persistent


379
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:18,976
identifier that can be
tracked across devices


380
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:21,706
and across locales,
and so even use


381
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,626
of Bluetooth makes
you subject to COPPA.


382
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:27,266
So, let me show you some demos


383
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:32,946
of some applications
that are PII-free.


384
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:40,916
This one is called
"Bonsai Slice."


385
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:45,716
It's a game where you
swack things with swords.


386
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:47,576
Again, you start it up.


387
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:51,306
There's not much to do
except tap to begin.


388
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:57,016
There's no particular login
or identification of yourself


389
00:18:57,016 --> 00:19:00,976
or any setup, and you can just
go right into playing the game.


390
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:06,046
[ Game sounds ]


391
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,926
So, there we go.


392
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:16,276
I think that's enough
game demo for that.


393
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:19,446
So, that is the first approach,


394
00:19:19,446 --> 00:19:22,306
which is just don't do
it and you'll be fine.


395
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,056
So, if you've got a
general purpose app


396
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,666
or you've got a kid oriented app


397
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:28,316
that doesn't collect any
personally identifying


398
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:29,746
information, you're fine.


399
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:30,316
You're in the clear.


400
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:35,006
The second approach is
to have an age screen


401
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:38,356
so you can tell whether
your user is under 13.


402
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:42,356
And then if they're over 13 you
can collect PII, and if they're


403
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:45,996
under 13 you just turn
off those features, OK.


404
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,536
It's pretty straightforward
to do.


405
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,906
One of the interesting
things is, well,


406
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:53,316
isn't their age personally
identifying information?


407
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:54,676
And the answer is no.


408
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:55,256
That's not.


409
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:58,316
You can ask their age, and
you can record their age


410
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,956
so you don't have
to ask every time.


411
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:03,656
If fact, we recommend that
what you do is you ask


412
00:20:03,656 --> 00:20:04,596
on first launch.


413
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,036
You record the age


414
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:11,466
in per account iCloud
preferences store.


415
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:14,036
And so when that user
is logged into iCloud,


416
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:17,586
because your under-13 users are
all going to be iCloud users.


417
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:22,816
Anytime your app launches and
you read that recorded age


418
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:26,606
of over or under 13 from their
per app iCloud preferences,


419
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:29,366
you know whether this
user's under 13 or not,


420
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,716
and you don't have to ask
again, and you can continue


421
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:32,726
to tailor the preference -


422
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,896
continue to tailor
the experience


423
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,746
for that under-13 user.


424
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:42,156
If they're under 13,
you can't just exit.


425
00:20:42,546 --> 00:20:44,256
That's not appropriate.


426
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,536
That is, have an app that
people can buy or download


427
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,426
and then have them
input their age


428
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:51,156
and then tell them,
oh you're too young.


429
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,786
Your app will be rejected
from the store if you do that.


430
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:57,236
If you have an age gate and
you have different behaviors


431
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:59,636
for above and under 13, you have


432
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:04,176
to have a pretty unified
valuable experience


433
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:05,006
for under 13.


434
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,196
You can't just quit, and
you can't have a really,


435
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:08,696
really crippled version
of the app.


436
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:09,676
It's got to be useful.


437
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:10,446
It's got to be fun.


438
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:13,056
But, you can omit
certain features like,


439
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,346
you know, like chat.


440
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:18,746
You can have chat in the over
13 and not have chat in the


441
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:22,366
under 13 as part of your
gameplay, for example.


442
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,506
Once again, you should be
thinking one, two, three.


443
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:27,106
>> [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.


444
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:28,206
>> Great, thank you.


445
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:31,816
And you might want to
have a parental gate too.


446
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:34,386
Parental gates are something
we recommend for applications


447
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,846
that are in the kids store,
where, you know, there is the


448
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,646
under 13s, where you
got to do one thing.


449
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:43,046
There's 13 through,
you know, grownups,


450
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:44,576
where you can anything.


451
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:50,166
And then over grownups
for terms and conditions


452
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,346
for buying additional stuff,
or if you're a parent,


453
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,676
you might want to have a
special control for that.


454
00:21:55,116 --> 00:22:00,926
So, I'm going to go through
some of the apps that do that.


455
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:05,896
This is "Toca Town," another
great immersive environment


456
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:06,626
for kids.


457
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:09,836
You can tell from the start
that this is targeted at kids,


458
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:12,226
and it's likely to
have kids under 13.


459
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:15,246
So, it's the kind of thing
that would be subject.


460
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:18,676
And it's got a parental
age screen.


461
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:21,856
If you see the For Parents
way up here in the corner,


462
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:24,636
when you tap that they ask you


463
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:28,056
with a very simple challenge
what year were you born in.


464
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:36,156
And that's - this is asking
you for both under or over 13


465
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:39,066
or also for parental
information.


466
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,496
If you enter a date
that is old enough


467
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:47,026
to be a parent then you can
go to the license agreement.


468
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:48,776
You can go to additional
purchases.


469
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:51,846
You can go to off app websites.


470
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,656
This is the kind of thing
that is required to be


471
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,926
in the App Store in
the kids section.


472
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:03,506
And finally here's "Fraggle
Rock" from Jim Henson.


473
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:05,746
This is just another mechanism


474
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:08,046
that you can use to
ask the kid's age.


475
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:10,356
You start up, there's info.


476
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:12,896
It's the same kind of thing.


477
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,506
This is parental info,
yet they're asking


478
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:20,746
for the full parental -
full age information here,


479
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,246
month, day, year.


480
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:24,906
So, you can have
a just the year.


481
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:28,076
You can have it just the age, or
you can have a full birthdate.


482
00:23:28,236 --> 00:23:30,856
Any one of those input
methods is sufficient


483
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:35,606
to ask whether the kid
is over or under 13.


484
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:39,726
Now, remember that that is only


485
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:42,706
for verifying whether
you can collect PII


486
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:44,096
or cannot collect PII.


487
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:48,196
Knowing the, knowing
that a parent has -


488
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:50,776
knowing that the age is
sufficiently old enough


489
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,816
to be a parent is
really not enough


490
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:55,546
for verified parental consent.


491
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:57,546
That's our third category.


492
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:03,896
You can - instead of having an
application that doesn't apply


493
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:06,576
or having an application where
you have forked behaviors,


494
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:10,726
you can have an application
that always uses the camera,


495
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:13,756
always uses the microphone,
always uses chat


496
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:14,856
and social networking,


497
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:17,906
uses location services,
goes the whole way.


498
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,486
You can do that for
kids of all ages


499
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:24,306
if you have verified
parental consent.


500
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:28,496
And that turns out to be kind of
hard to do, because parents have


501
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:32,826
to consent explicitly
for your app.


502
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:36,796
Parental consent that Apple
has received for the kids


503
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:40,096
to use the device, we
cannot delegate that to you,


504
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:41,886
because we don't know
what your app is doing.


505
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:46,296
You must ask the parent to
have an explicit consent to use


506
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:48,666
that app for that kit,


507
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:51,766
and that's a lot of
work on your part.


508
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,936
It's the same rule, you know
if you've got a website,


509
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:57,106
if you've been dealing
with this under the -


510
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:59,586
since 2000 on a website,
it's the same rules.


511
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:02,306
So, it's pretty easy if
you've already got a website.


512
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:07,576
In fact, many apps just simply
direct the kids to the website


513
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:10,126
to go through the COPPA
process before they can proceed.


514
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:12,416
There are several
ways to do this.


515
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:13,996
You can pick the one
that's right for you,


516
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:15,316
talk to your lawyer about it.


517
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:19,336
And a simple parental gate of
the kind that you need to be


518
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:22,806
in app - kids section of the App
Store, that is not sufficient


519
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:25,586
for COPPA verifiable
parental consent.


520
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:29,386
Once you get verifiable,


521
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,336
verified parental
consent, it's not over.


522
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:37,336
Some of the requirements of
collecting PII are that you have


523
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:42,566
to display that PII and
allow parents to review it


524
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,206
and delete it on demand.


525
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,466
You, the parents need to be able


526
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:48,396
to stop the collection
going forward.


527
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:52,036
You have to keep that
information reasonably secure


528
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,806
and be able to demonstrate
to the FTC


529
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:56,396
that you are keeping
it secure, and you need


530
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:59,006
to delete the information
when you no longer need it.


531
00:25:59,006 --> 00:26:01,616
You can't amass vast databases


532
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,466
of private information
about kids.


533
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:07,106
Now I don't have a
lot of good examples


534
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:13,926
of what on-device verified
parental consent is mainly


535
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:16,996
because this is kind
of new, and not a lot


536
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:18,056
of apps are doing this.


537
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:21,936
The traditional way of doing it,
if you just look at a website


538
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:25,096
like Neopets, this is
the traditional way


539
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:29,476
of getting verified parental
consent is a webpage with a lot


540
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:35,276
of legal contract and then
a form that you print.


541
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:42,326
Please print legibly, and then
you fax it in to the company.


542
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:45,386
This is what websites
traditionally do before you


543
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:46,246
create an account.


544
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:49,426
And in the app world,
for example,


545
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:52,766
there is the great family
app called "Life360,"


546
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:57,206
which is a great way for parents
to communicate with their kids.


547
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:58,466
It sets up chat.


548
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:00,276
It sets up location services.


549
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:06,976
It is a fully featured family
management app, and it's going


550
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:12,026
to have kids under 13, and what
they do is you - they send you


551
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:15,516
to the app to create
accounts, and they send you


552
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,066
to the website to
create accounts.


553
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:22,496
And the website just has a
PDF that you fill in, you sign


554
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:24,716
and you mail or fax
in to the company,


555
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,736
because that's the
state of the art.


556
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:30,016
We can do better than this, and
we want to do better than this.


557
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,376
We really want to give
parents a great way


558
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:35,936
of delivering verifiable
parental consent


559
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:38,596
in a way that's acceptable to
the Federal Trade Commission.


560
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:40,926
Here's an example of
a good start at it.


561
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:42,126
Here's an app called "DIY."


562
00:27:42,206 --> 00:27:46,806
When you start it takes you


563
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:51,406
through some setup
screens of what it does.


564
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:57,076
You pick an avatar, and
then it has an age slider,


565
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:00,286
and this is kind of like
the age slider that you saw


566
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:03,216
in the previous category for
deciding whether to turn on


567
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:05,476
or turn off capabilities.


568
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:11,276
And notice that if I'm
14, and I pick a nickname,


569
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:13,006
and then I can enter my email


570
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:14,496
and password to create
an account.


571
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,126
Very straightforward.


572
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:26,376
But, if I set an age under 13,
notice that interfaces change.


573
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:29,496
It doesn't ask me for
my password and email.


574
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:31,856
It asks for my parents' email,


575
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:36,416
and it sends my parents
an invitation


576
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,686
that they must approve before I
can go further with an account,


577
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,296
and that does the email,


578
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:44,356
that does the parental
consent process.


579
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,886
They have to review
the agreement.


580
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:46,766
They have to sign it.


581
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,746
They have to send it in.


582
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,116
That's what you need to do


583
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:50,906
under the COPPA law
in order to do that.


584
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:56,096
So, those are the ways
that you can get verified


585
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:57,026
parental consent.


586
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:03,036
Now this applies primarily in
the United States of America


587
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:06,286
and the territories that are
subject to the COPPA law.


588
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:09,476
That is not your whole market.


589
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,906
And the good news is
that in most of the rest


590
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:15,106
of the world there
aren't laws like COPPA.


591
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:17,476
But, they're coming, and many


592
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:20,036
of them will be modeled
on the U.S. law.


593
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:23,176
And the implementation
method we've chosen,


594
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:25,786
which is probably a good
idea for you to follow,


595
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:29,666
is what we're doing in the U.S.
we're going to deploy everywhere


596
00:29:29,856 --> 00:29:32,136
because it shows
respect for kids.


597
00:29:32,426 --> 00:29:35,646
It shows restraint on our
parts, and it makes us adaptable


598
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:39,746
and flexible for whatever
other countries may adopt.


599
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,006
The most important
thing for you is


600
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:46,256
that the ages I've been
talking about, 13 to be a kid,


601
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:49,536
and 18 to be able to
sign a legal contract -


602
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:53,036
don't take those as
hard coded values,


603
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:54,726
because they're different
worldwide.


604
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:59,736
The age that COPPA applies to
in the United States is 13.


605
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,576
But other countries
have ages where -


606
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:05,456
children's private
information is protected,


607
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:09,366
and that varies all
around the world from 13


608
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:11,076
up to 16 years of age.


609
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:14,016
Similarly the age at
which you can agree


610
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:17,616
to a legal contract is 18,


611
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:23,226
but in other countries
it may be 19, 20 or 21.


612
00:30:23,226 --> 00:30:25,906
You should tailor these
on a per country basis.


613
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:30,916
Instead of hard coding 13 or
18, you can check your region


614
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:35,726
at runtime using StoreKit,
just use the ProductsResponse


615
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:38,476
to a products request with
your bundle identifier,


616
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:42,736
get the products response and
look at the priceLocale field.


617
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:45,146
And that will tell you
the locale of the store


618
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,106
from which your product
was bought.


619
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,996
And then if there are
regulations that apply


620
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:53,676
in that locale, you can make
decisions on what age is based


621
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:57,416
on that locale rather than hard
coding the numbers 13 or 18.


622
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:02,576
OK, I wonder what
you're thinking now.


623
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,786
Hmm, maybe it might be -


624
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:07,466
>> [group response] I
want to call my lawyer.


625
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:08,416
>> Very good.


626
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:11,026
It's an awesome opportunity.


627
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:17,276
These are families and parents
who are loyal Apple customers,


628
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:21,136
and they are going to love
being able to share apps


629
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:25,646
with their kids, to watch what
apps their kids are buying,


630
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:28,976
to let the kids shop in
the store by themselves


631
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,496
with some degree of safety;


632
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:32,486
they're going to
love this feature.


633
00:31:32,796 --> 00:31:36,666
They are going - this is really,
really going to increase the use


634
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,946
of our devices among kids.


635
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:42,586
We want to make sure that
that's safe and that's legal.


636
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:46,726
If you're writing apps
for kids you should apply


637
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:50,586
to all applicable statutes
in all of the areas


638
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:54,176
where you sell your apps, and
that means you need a lawyer.


639
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:58,926
Don't collect personal
information, ID, pictures,


640
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:02,026
sounds or locations at
all if you can avoid it,


641
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,126
and then you'll avoid
a lot of hassle.


642
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:06,426
If that's what your
app is about,


643
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:09,396
then you can choose either to
have a forked experience based


644
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:12,606
on asking the kid's age,
and at that point you might


645
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:17,656
as well fork for younger kids,
older kids and parents in order


646
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:18,566
to be in the app store.


647
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:20,296
That's a really,
really good idea.


648
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:25,276
Or if you really
need kids under 13


649
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:28,846
and you need personally
identifiable information,


650
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:33,406
then what you need to do is
go the FTC codified verifiable


651
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,386
parental consent process.


652
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:37,616
Get the parent's
signature on a piece


653
00:32:37,616 --> 00:32:39,986
of paper before you
can allow the kid,


654
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:41,376
before you can allow your app


655
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:44,086
to collect personally
identifying information


656
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:44,936
from the kid.


657
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:48,626
Do the same thing worldwide -
it'll be a lot more convenient


658
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:51,306
and it'll be a lot more
consistent and prepare you


659
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:52,936
for what's going to
happen in the future.


660
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,796
Here's some resources
that you can deal with.


661
00:32:56,366 --> 00:33:00,886
There's a Safe Harbor Program,
where there are organizations


662
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:06,796
that you can go to, to
let them help you set


663
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:07,996
up accounts for kids.


664
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:10,426
Federal Trade Commission
has a whole list


665
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:12,216
of these safe harbor
organizations.


666
00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:18,106
It's a really, really good
place to go to talk to people,


667
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:20,866
consult with them and use some


668
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,606
of their services
to be safe for kids.


669
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:25,386
Another good organization
is Moms with Apps.


670
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:27,976
Moms with Apps has a lot
of expertise in this area.


671
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:31,566
And you can go to the Moms
with Apps websites to see some


672
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,956
of examples of apps
that deal with kids


673
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:35,366
in a really, really
great manner.


674
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:40,506
There's always our Technology
Evangelist Paul Danbold,


675
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:42,986
and developer forums, lots


676
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:44,846
of developer forums
on apps for kids.


677
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,816
Related sessions, since
it's late in the week,


678
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:49,406
there aren't too many coming up.


679
00:33:49,406 --> 00:33:51,326
The session right
before this on Security


680
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:54,246
and Privacy is a really good
one to go back to the films on.


681
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:59,546
Also to the "Designing a Great
In-App Purchase Experience"


682
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:00,816
that Rachel Roth gave.


683
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:02,596
That is a heck of
a presentation.


684
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:04,526
You ought to go to
the tape and see that.


685
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,886
And then "Optimizing
In-App Purchases,"


686
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:09,886
that's the one I mentioned with
James Wilson telling you how


687
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:13,516
to handle the scenario where a
kid asks for an In-App Purchase,


688
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:17,766
asks to buy his own, and
their parent is going


689
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,126
to be two hours before
they click the switch


690
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:23,306
and let the kid get those coins
that they needed in the game.


691
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:25,176
I really appreciate
you being here today.


692
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:27,466
I hope you develop
great apps for kids.


693
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,266
We want to have a lot of
apps for kids available


694
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:34,376
for Family Sharing when Family
Sharing opens up, when iOS 8


695
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:38,025
and OS X Yosemite are available.


696
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:40,116
And I really look forward
to seeing you in the store.


697
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:41,275
Thank you very much everybody.


698
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:44,000
