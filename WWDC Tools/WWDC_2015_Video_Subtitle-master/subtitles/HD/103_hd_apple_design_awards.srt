00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:21,186
>> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the 2015 Apple Design Awards


2
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:26,596
and welcome your host for
this evening, John Geleynse.


3
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:34,596
[ Applause ]


4
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:35,696
>> JOHN GELEYNSE:
Well, good evening.


5
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:37,296
It is -- or good afternoon.


6
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:38,546
It's still afternoon, actually.


7
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,226
It is great to be here.


8
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:44,126
It's a great moment
to end off this day.


9
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,506
I know it's been long, many of
you have been waiting in lines


10
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,746
around the building to get


11
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:50,446
into the Keynote,
and that was a blast.


12
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,476
The Keynote was a blast, too.


13
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:55,706
And then you came into
-- you got your lunch,


14
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:59,236
then you had State of the Union,
and that was a great session.


15
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:03,526
And now we want to finish
the day by taking a moment


16
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:05,646
to celebrate the work that some


17
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:07,536
of you have done that's
been extraordinary.


18
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,426
Many of you do -- all of
you do extraordinary work,


19
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:13,376
but there are some that
stand out from the rest,


20
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:15,296
and we want to take
a few moments


21
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,996
to just celebrate some
excellence in software design.


22
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:22,956
Now, to begin this
evening and this ceremony,


23
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:26,806
I want to just kick off with a
video, which is a retrospective


24
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:29,426
of the winners from
the last 14 years.


25
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,536
You know, time flies;
doesn't it?


26
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,826
How many of you are familiar
with so many of those apps?


27
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,456
You played with those games.


28
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,896
You played with those
productivity tools,


29
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,636
some of those design tools.


30
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,416
And I had to demo
every one of them


31
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,446
on this stage over the years.


32
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:44,336
And this is just some
of those that came --


33
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:47,146
that you saw a moment ago coming
through for the last 14 years.


34
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:51,186
Those 14 years represent
14 years of Design Awards


35
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:55,346
since OS X was announced,
Mac OS X entered the stage,


36
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:58,276
and we had developers creating
apps right from day one.


37
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,796
And then, of course, the
App Store came and iOS


38
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,526
and everything that
we've known since then.


39
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:05,656
So many of you might be familiar
with the most recent ones


40
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:09,076
that were shown, and if you
just take a look at this list --


41
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:12,276
and this isn't to pick off
the best of the 14 years --


42
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:14,296
but these are some notable
ones that I just wanted


43
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,216
to highlight for a minute.


44
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:20,396
You know, Starry Night Backyard,
I remember showing that off.


45
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:24,476
That was incredible in the
first days of Mac OS X.


46
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:28,576
Macnification, this
great app for science.


47
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:32,336
Delicious Library 2, this
whole genre of apps that came


48
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:35,606
out in the early days of Mac OS
X that redefined the experience


49
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:39,236
for so many of us and actually
forced -- well, not forced --


50
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,996
but got people excited


51
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,796
to purchase a Mac just
to use those apps.


52
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,666
MLB.com At Bat.


53
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,216
Flight Control.


54
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,326
Who didn't play Flight
Control in the first days


55
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,536
of the App Store, right?


56
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:54,946
Paper for scientific research,
and then Monument Valley,


57
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:58,346
Infinity Blade, incredible apps.


58
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:05,686
What's interesting is that
these apps have set the standard


59
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:07,616
for so many things; right?


60
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,976
They've set the standard
for the user experience


61
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,176
that we expect on
these platforms.


62
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:17,046
These folks were pioneers in
many ways, not just these apps,


63
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:20,056
but the apps that showed up
across the last 14 years.


64
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,766
And I think the -- what's really
cool way to think about it is


65
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:27,686
that in so many ways, each of
the winners each year stood


66
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:31,196
on the shoulders of the
winners from the previous year.


67
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:34,646
Because so many of these
apps defined a new standard,


68
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,616
a benchmark in performance
or in usability,


69
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:40,926
and they inspired the rest of
you, inspired so many people


70
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:43,096
to go off and create
the next great thing.


71
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:49,406
Now, these apps every
year we've judged the apps


72
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:51,486
with the same set of
criteria, basically.


73
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,846
We've looked at delightful apps.


74
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:55,796
These are apps that
invite people to play


75
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:58,066
or get real things done; right?


76
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,986
They are satisfying;
they are rewarding.


77
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,876
We've always looked
for innovative apps,


78
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:07,686
winners that have this spark
of brilliance that it's hard


79
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:10,606
to define, but you know
it when you see it.


80
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,606
There's state-of-the-art
apps that are modern.


81
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,776
They are platform
differentiating.


82
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:20,426
They're high performance; they
have high-end capabilities,


83
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:21,786
and they are superprecise.


84
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,056
We look for apps
that are engaging.


85
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:28,006
Engagement means that
people keep coming back


86
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,126
to use these apps.


87
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,886
Some of the games
that were shown,


88
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,586
some of the productivity
tools are things


89
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:33,776
that we can't live without.


90
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,076
We can't live without
playing these games,


91
00:06:36,076 --> 00:06:37,906
and we keep coming back
to them again and again.


92
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,126
We look for apps
that are enabling.


93
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:44,426
And great Apple Design
Award-winning apps


94
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,186
that are enabling
allow you to do things


95
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:49,926
that you could never
do before in new ways.


96
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:53,096
And lastly, we look
for designed apps.


97
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:57,206
These are apps that are deeply
considered, that are familiar,


98
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:00,096
they're appealing,
they're attractive,


99
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,756
and they're super intuitive
to use for the people


100
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,946
that they were created for.


101
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,806
So, a quick summary of
how we pick the apps.


102
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,386
We've always picked them
in basically the same way.


103
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,916
We've always used essentially
this set of criteria,


104
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:16,786
and this is the criteria
that we used for this year


105
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,356
to pick tonight's winners.


106
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:23,016
I'd like to invite my
colleague, Shaan Pruden,


107
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,456
on stage to award
tonight's winners.


108
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:35,016
[ Applause ]


109
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:35,976
>> SHAAN PRUDEN: Hello.


110
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,656
This year we will be honoring
ten apps from categories


111
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:42,936
across the App Store, but first
we wanted to take a moment


112
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:45,976
and honor two students among
our scholarship winners.


113
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:49,816
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: Now,
the students we are


114
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,246
about to award are scholarship
winners for this year,


115
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,476
but in the process of looking
at the scholarship apps,


116
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,996
we discovered some apps
that they, themselves,


117
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,716
had also written
for the App Store,


118
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,316
and we were pretty impressed
with some of these apps


119
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,476
that were on the App Store
by these scholarship winners.


120
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,166
So the two awards
tonight are going to go


121
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:10,046
to developer scholarship winners


122
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,186
who have an app on
the App Store.


123
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:14,666
>> SHAAN PRUDEN: And our first
student winner is Elementary


124
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,086
Minute by Klemens Strasser.


125
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:24,066
>> The idea for the
app came to Klemens


126
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:30,326
in April 2014 while
sitting in his room thinking


127
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:32,446
about the possibility of
having a quiz on his wrist.


128
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,356
Since there wasn't
an Apple Watch yet,


129
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,956
Klemens developed
it for the iPhone.


130
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:49,616
[ Applause ]


131
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:50,896
>> SHAAN PRUDEN:
Congratulations.


132
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:54,096
Here you go.


133
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,726
Elementary Minute is a
fast-paced trivia game


134
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:59,006
where you are presenting
with statements on topics


135
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,526
that include math,
geography, and famous people.


136
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,536
Quickly swipe up
or down to decide


137
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:05,166
if the statements
are true or false.


138
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,876
This app was created by Klemens,


139
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,086
who is a computer
science student


140
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:10,156
at Technical University
in Graz, Austria.


141
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:16,656
[ Applause ]


142
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:17,696
>> JOHN GELEYNSE:
Austria, right.


143
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,656
Big cheer down in front here.


144
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,696
We Picked Elementary Minute as
a student Design Award winner


145
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,796
because we loved the design, it
was super simple, and it was one


146
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:30,416
of the first games that
came out for Apple Watch.


147
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:34,326
It's built, obviously, on UIKit
and those sorts of technologies.


148
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:35,746
It's integrated with
Game Center,


149
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:38,286
and it has a clever
two-game mode.


150
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,906
You can do a quick five-second
quiz, trivia quiz on your wrist,


151
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:42,946
which is perfect for the Watch,


152
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:46,016
and you can do a one-minute
quiz both on Apple Watch


153
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,356
and on iPhone, and
we just thought


154
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:51,846
that the way this was done
was really well executed,


155
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:52,926
so congratulations.


156
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,736
>> SHAAN PRUDEN: And
that's Elementary Minute.


157
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,436
Our other student
Award this evening goes


158
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:06,446
to jump-O by ByteBrushers.


159
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:11,546
[ Applause ]


160
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:15,696
>> Founded in 2013, ByteBrushers
is a two-person game development


161
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:16,926
team located in Brazil.


162
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:21,076
In 2012, Victor took a
game development course,


163
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,276
and a year later,
he convinced Gabriel


164
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,286
to attend the same course.


165
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,416
One day while discussing what it
was like when they were bullied


166
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,346
as kids, they decided
to create a game


167
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,846
that reflected their experience.


168
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:40,666
>> SHAAN PRUDEN:
Congratulations.


169
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,836
Jump-O is a minimalist game


170
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,346
where you play Roundy
the circle,


171
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:51,106
overcoming the dangers presented
by the squareish world.


172
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,296
It was created by two
university students from Brazil


173
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:56,206
and features beautiful
hand-drawn puzzles.


174
00:10:58,126 --> 00:10:59,066
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: You
know what's really fun


175
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,586
for us actually at Apple
is these folks took some


176
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,976
of the iOS training
courses that are in Brazil


177
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:07,196
and gained some experience
there to build this game.


178
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,326
We picked jump-O as a
student Design Award winner


179
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:14,066
because of its unique minimalist
design, as Shaan mentioned.


180
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:16,936
It's built on Game
Center, it uses Sprite Kit


181
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:19,586
for scene management
and game physics.


182
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,886
The input of the
game is super simple.


183
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:23,756
It's tap and device motion.


184
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:28,206
And it's got great
responsiveness, 68 worlds,


185
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:31,486
48 levels, just a
really fun game


186
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:34,326
that we thought was just
really, really well done,


187
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,536
and one of those games
that seems easy to learn


188
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,706
but it's hard to
master in that genre.


189
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,936
So congratulations,
great work, guys.

191
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:51,746
>> SHAAN PRUDEN: And these
are our two student winners.


192
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:54,596
Now let's move on to the
Design Award winners.


193
00:11:55,796 --> 00:12:05,156
Our first winner is an
imagination-stirring puzzle.


194
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:08,976
It is Shadowmatic by
Triada Studio Games.


195
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,206
>> Triada Studio was
established in Armenia in 1993


196
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,366
as a computer graphics
and animation studio,


197
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:23,546
and they successfully work on
TV commercials, visual effects


198
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,116
for movies, and various
other animation projects.


199
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,856
In 2007, they thought about
branching into video games,


200
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:30,506
began building a game engine.


201
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,526
The four-person game
team started work


202
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:36,966
on Shadowmatic in March 2012.


203
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,666
>> SHAAN PRUDEN:
Shadowmatic is a unique twist


204
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,806
on shadow puppets.


205
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,366
I don't want to stand
in their way.


206
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,236
Rotate abstract objects
in a spotlight


207
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:50,496
to find recognizable silhouettes
in the projected shadow


208
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,646
that are relevant to the
surrounding environment.


209
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:56,616
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: All right.


210
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:58,556
So we picked Shadowmatic
as a winner


211
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:03,516
since it's ornately crafted
-- bit of feedback --


212
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:06,666
super imaginative, and
really well executed.


213
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,356
And I'd like to show
this to you now.


214
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:12,446
So let's get into the
level -- let's turn it off.


215
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,216
Let's get into the main menu.


216
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:18,866
So what you see here is just
there's device motion that's


217
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,456
affecting the view
into this main menu.


218
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,936
I can interact with objects,
which is no big deal,


219
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,256
but I am just showing
you the attention


220
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,616
to detail that's
even at this level.


221
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:31,326
And straightaway you hear
this ambient sound track,


222
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:34,516
and it's a beautiful sound
track throughout the game,


223
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:37,056
and it's available for
purchase on iTunes even.


224
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:40,816
So let me just go into
this second level here


225
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:42,796
and show you how this works.


226
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:44,866
If you play the game,
you already know.


227
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,396
If you've not played the game,
this is a good level to start


228
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:49,106
at to show you how it all works.


229
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:51,506
So basically what we
are doing is taking one


230
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:54,496
of these objects here, which is
represented at various levels


231
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,926
with ceramics and metal
and wood and all kinds


232
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,746
of different materials that
are beautifully rendered


233
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:02,836
in the scene, and you take one
finger to rotate it around,


234
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,696
and you take two
fingers to twist it.


235
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:08,176
And essentially, what you are
trying to do is figure out what,


236
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:09,446
you know, shadow it is


237
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,546
that you're trying
to build on the wall.


238
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,416
So I am going to
rotate it slightly,


239
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,496
looks like I am getting
some kind of a handle there.


240
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:21,536
And you'll notice on the bottom
of the screen there's some dots


241
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:25,326
that may light up here soon
if I get close to what it is


242
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,146
that I'm -- yeah, as
soon as I get close


243
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:30,796
to the puzzle I am trying to
solve, I get this feedback


244
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:32,296
on these glowing
dots at the bottom.


245
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:35,186
And so now I think I am pretty
close to something that looks


246
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:39,186
like a teapot, so there we go.


247
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:42,056
I get the six dots, and I
figured out this puzzle.


248
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,506
And every level is like this,
and obviously, you're timed.


249
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:47,056
As you go up through the levels,


250
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,506
it gets more and
more complicated.


251
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:52,616
We love the parallax effect
that looks like you are looking


252
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,436
into a window in the scene.


253
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:58,416
We love the high-resolution
rendering, the high fidelity


254
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,366
of the execution in the app,


255
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,076
and we think this app
totally makes an Apple Design


256
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:04,656
Award winner.


257
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:06,216

of artist Patrick Smith.


265
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,016
His educational background
is in painting.


266
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:39,386
But soon after graduating,


267
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:42,106
he discovered he could combine
his particular visual imagery


268
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:44,676
with his lifelong love of
animation to create responsive,


269
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,786
immersive, and dreamlike
experiences.


270
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,296
Metamorphabet launched on the
App Store in February 2015.


271
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:08,706

Poke, prod, drag,
and spin objects


274
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,136
to reveal surprising vignettes,


275
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:17,596
where letters are magically
transformed into words.


276
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:23,696
>> We picked Metamorphabet for
its outstanding creativity,


277
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:26,736
convincing physics,
smooth animations,


278
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,146
and exploratory design.


279
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,886
I want to show this to you now.


280
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:37,066
So pick the first letter.


281
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:40,116
Right from the start you
see this torn fabric effect,


282
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:41,756
which is the beginning
of the animations.


283
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:45,186
I tap on these letters,
and they start to interact.


284
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:48,746
I am simply tapping, pinching,
zooming, whatever I want to do,


285
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:51,116
whatever the child would want
to do, whatever the student


286
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:55,716
of letters would want to do, and
you get these scenes that reveal


287
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:56,976
as you interact with
the letters.


288
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:00,866
So as I start to stroke
the A and move upwards,


289
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:05,026
I now get the word Arch, and
the narrator would tell me


290
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:05,715
that word.


291
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,556
It begins with A.


292
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:10,386
As I play with the scene,
suddenly it starts to move.


293
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:14,086
I get this effect of ambling.


294
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,945
So you can continue to
play with these letters,


295
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,356
and you learn more
and more words


296
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:19,415
that begin with that letter.


297
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,465
And kids, students, you
know, learning English


298
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:23,826
as a second language, whatever,


299
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:27,236
are going to learn these
characters and want


300
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:28,506
to keep coming back
to this game.


301
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,346
Let me just show you the G.


302
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:34,276
My last name starts with
G, I like the letter.


303
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:35,326
Let's go in.


304
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:37,866
We tap on it a few times,
it goes three-dimensional.


305
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,316
I pinch on it, it
becomes a guitar.


306
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,856
You can look at the
attention to detail here


307
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:49,026
because I can play individual
strings, but if I start


308
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:54,066
to strum the guitar, a
garden begins to grow.


309
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,886
Kids just love this
stuff, right?


310
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,076
It's just surprising,
unexpected,


311
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:01,846
and I can pick these flowers,
and they turn into ghosts,


312
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:05,786
which again begins
with the letter G.


313
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:09,936
And that's just an example
of the nature of this app,


314
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:14,296
which is just this bright,
cheerful app with super-great --


315
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,916

effects crafted by one person.

00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:30,066
to build a personalized
stock watch list


338
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,236
with smart notifications.


339
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:33,896
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: All right.


340
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:34,506
Let's take a look.


341
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:37,646
So Robinhood distinguishes
itself with this clean,


342
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:40,576
content-centric design,
beautiful typography,


343
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,696
and a design that
really does a good job


344
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,756
at balancing app branding
with iOS design conventions.


345
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:52,436
So right out of the gate,
the app just draws you in.


346
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:55,596
The goal of the app is to
get more people to invest,


347
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:59,446
and right away, they decide
that there's no need to sign


348
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:02,656
up to actually do
things in the app.


349
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:04,016
Let's see here.


350
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,906
Let me go to my backup.


351
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:17,096
There we go.


352
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:20,786
Because on the main screen,
if we simply scroll up,


353
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,336
we get a bunch of stock
symbols, and these are


354
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,486
because the app is using
geolocation to come


355
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,896
up with these symbols based
on companies that are nearby.


356
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,756
So let's just tap into
Apple, and you can look


357
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:35,576
at Apple's performance
over the last little while.


358
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:38,826
You can tap on this chart and
see the stock performance.


359
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,226
I am not logged in yet.


360
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:42,006
I am not a customer of theirs.


361
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:43,036
I am not a member.


362
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,416
I am not -- you know, I
haven't done anything here.


363
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,766
I am just playing around with
this app, exploring with it.


364
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:50,596
I can just tap and drag on the
chart, get some great feedback


365
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,766
on the values at the top.


366
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:55,356
I can pinch and get a range
and get an average value.


367
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:56,746
So that's pretty cool.


368
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,706
I can look at stats
from the company.


369
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:02,716
I can swipe, do the
page effect to go back


370
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,746
to a different symbol.


371
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:05,976
Here I am at SPY; right?


372
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:07,706
I am looking through
all of this.


373
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,556
Right? So I can explore
all of these.


374
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:12,496
Let's go back to Apple.


375
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:15,356
And let's say that at this
point we are like yeah,


376
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:18,186
wonder what it would be like
to buy a stock in this app.


377
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,856
So we tap Buy, we decide
let's buy 25 shares


378
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:25,966
at the current market price
for a total of $3,195.


379
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:26,906
We say that's fine.


380
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:31,306
Review. Robinhood tells us
that this is a simulated trade,


381
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:32,846
but if we were doing a trade,


382
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,306
we could just swipe
up from the bottom.


383
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:37,116
The device vibrates,
I get some feedback,


384
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:38,936
and it says that's
what it would be


385
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:41,286
like to purchase some
stock in this application.


386
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,666
And at this point, I can
decide this is pretty cool


387
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,306
and I am going to sign
up and you quickly put


388
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,776
in some basic information
about yourself,


389
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,936
you decide how you are going
to fund your transactions,


390
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,896
whether it's a checking
account, savings account,


391
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:57,106
and then you move on from
there and start investing.


392
00:21:57,536 --> 00:22:02,506
And Robinhood uses Touch ID
for secure authentication,


393
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,466
uses SSL encryption
to protect your data,


394
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,956
and this is just
such a great app.


395
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:10,166
We just love the design.


396
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:13,986
So simple, just draws you
in, and really well done.


397
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:14,786
Congratulations.

415
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:10,306
Imagined by designers and
made exclusively for the Mac,


416
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,616
this fresh-faced, multifaceted
illustration app lets


417
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:14,506
creatives shine.


418
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:20,686
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: This app is
a seriously fast vector drawing


419
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:22,576
application for creative
professionals,


420
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:25,076
and there's no way that
I can show you, you know,


421
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:27,446
very many of the
features in this.


422
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:30,176
This is a full-featured
vector drawing app.


423
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,086
One of the cool things
that they've got in the --


424
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:36,026
just to get you oriented
is in the top-left corner


425
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,866
of the screen, there
are three icons,


426
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:39,816
and these represent
their personas,


427
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:41,726
basically modes for the app.


428
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,616
So here we have the
draw persona,


429
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,606
which gives us the tools
we need for vector drawing.


430
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:49,806
We can shift to the pixel
persona, which is the tools


431
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,056
for pixel-based editing.


432
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,786
Then we can move to the export
persona, which allows us


433
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:56,326
to export layers, groups,
objects, and regions.


434
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,906
Right? Let's go back
to the draw persona.


435
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:01,906
This app was written
from scratch on OS X


436
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:05,656
and takes advantage of Grand
Central Dispatch, OpenGL,


437
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:09,496
Core Graphics, and it's
fully optimized for 64 bit


438
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:12,376
and multicore, which
means it can do a ton


439
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:13,886
of stuff super fast.


440
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:18,316
So just scrolling around in
the document is super quick.


441
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:23,206
I can zoom in to up to a
million percent if I needed to.


442
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,496
As I scroll around at something


443
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:28,326
like 5,000 percent right
now, it's very quick.


444
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,266
They've got a great
feature where I can go


445
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:32,486
into these split views.


446
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,246
Just a second here.


447
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:42,976
Let's go into view mode
and go into split view,


448
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,926
which lets me split the
screen into two views,


449
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:49,596
and one of these views I can
actually go into outline view,


450
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:52,596
which means that in real-time,
I am getting my object --


451
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,266
I can see the full
rendered version or I can go


452
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:59,976
into outline view and select
individual objects [applause].


453
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:03,516
So then I can select them,
rotate them, grow them,


454
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:07,136
whatever I need to do,
and all of this is live.


455
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:12,516
So I could pick this object here
and grow it into this portion


456
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:14,796
of the screen, and you would see
the rendering effect right live


457
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,196
across the divide.


458
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:19,106
And I can just move this


459
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:21,116
in real-time back
and forth super fast.


460
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:26,456
Now, I was talking about
how you could do zoom,


461
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:30,666
and I remember seeing that there
was a spelling error up here,


462
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,496
so I am just going
to zoom in here


463
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,366
and fix something on my design.


464
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,366
Now I am in at about
10,000 percent.


465
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:41,726
And I am just going to
change this one edit here,


466
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,916
and you know, move back out.


467
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,666
And you are looking
at this image here.


468
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:50,606
Right? So there's a
ton I could show you.


469
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:52,416
They've got a great corner tool,


470
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:56,056
they've got tremendous
functionality,


471
00:25:56,176 --> 00:26:00,216
and we were just blown away
by how modern this app was


472
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:03,716
and how capable it was
and how great it was --


473
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:06,936
and how optimized it was for the
most modern Mac hardware today.


474
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,816
Excellent work, guys.


475
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:09,746

496
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,436
you know, it's got
this addictive balance


497
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:33,936
between a casual puzzle and
arcade game and, you know,


498
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:36,326
if you haven't played this game
you are missing out big time,


499
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,086
but if you have, you know
exactly what this is all about;


500
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:39,246
right?


501
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:41,546
You are this chicken
or some crazy character


502
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:44,806
that they've drawn, and you are
crossing these multilane roads.


503
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,926
Now, in this particular
case, I am not the chicken,


504
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,126
but let's move anyway.


505
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:52,676
I am tapping to move forward,
and I can move left and right.


506
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,756
This is the schoolgirl.


507
00:27:58,546 --> 00:27:59,996
See how far I can get here.


508
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,826
Oh, let's go, miss the
train, get out of the way.


509
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:06,496
Whoa. Let's keep going.


510
00:28:06,826 --> 00:28:10,896
Oh, she got run over.


511
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:11,676
Okay. I am sorry.


512
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:12,606
Let's try another one.


513
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:13,456
Let's try the chicken,


514
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,856
see if the chicken comes
up, love the chicken.


515
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:18,146
So you have all these
characters that they've created,


516
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,646
and there's some
really good stuff.


517
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:23,666
Here's the dress,
you know, #thedress.


518
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:27,466
There is dark lord,
gravedigger, hot shot.


519
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:29,426
Let's go back to one
of my favorite ones.


520
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:33,106
I actually own chickens, just
the funniest creatures around,


521
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,986
so this is a real fun game
to play with your chicken.


522
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:43,806
So if you just look at the
8-bit isometric graphics,


523
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:48,556
just the sound.


524
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:52,146
Oh, and if that happens,
I can actually share this


525
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:55,646
with my friends and
look at the effect.

00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:03,616
You know, Crossy Road -- I mean,


528
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,226
you could play this
forever; right?


529
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:07,786
And I know people who
get all the way up to 700


530
00:29:07,786 --> 00:29:09,466
and it kills me because
the highest I can get is


531
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:10,516
about 70 or something.


532
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,426
But Crossy Road is such
exciting game play.


533
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:16,206
They have beautiful,
gorgeous 8-bit graphics,


534
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:18,846
if that even makes sense,
but there's just something


535
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:21,756
about the way you've designed
your characters, the artwork.


536
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:25,576
Hilarious collision animations,
expressive characters,


537
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:28,256
excellent sound design,
and you know what?


538
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:32,186
I think all of that combines to
create really great personality.


539
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:34,796
This game has got
tremendous personality,


540
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:37,106
which is really actually
a great characteristic


541
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:37,966
for an ADA winner.


542
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:39,206

00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:25,636
in March of this year.

>> SHAAN PRUDEN:
Fantastical is a calendar app


557
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,846
that strikes the right balance
between features and usability.


558
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,866
With natural language creation
of events and reminders,


559
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:41,196
beautiful calendar views,
and ultra smart event lists.


560
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:41,616
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: Great.


561
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:45,026
So we picked Fantastical
for the beautiful


562
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,126
and thoughtfully designed
experience they brought


563
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:48,246
to OS X Yosemite.


564
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,206
I know that they've
worked really hard on this


565
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:56,406
because they have supported
prior to this iPad, iPhone,


566
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:58,626
most recently they just
came out with Apple Watch,


567
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:02,706
and they have done a great job
at bringing the visual style


568
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:05,246
of the app across
all of those devices


569
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:08,436
and at delivering
something fantastic on OS X.


570
00:31:08,756 --> 00:31:11,116
So I want to just show you a
couple of features in this app


571
00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:13,356
that we think make
it really great.


572
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:15,346
First of all, it's super fast.


573
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:18,066
So if you just go to the
left side of the screen here,


574
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:21,116
you scroll through all
your stuff, the entire --


575
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:22,906
you know, everything
just follows along.


576
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:25,566
You look at the top-left corner,
it's whipping across the weeks


577
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,106
to indicate the ones
that are selected.


578
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:30,006
The right side is moving
through your full calendar.


579
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:33,086
And there's just not a
hesitation to the app.


580
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,956
That's fantastic.


581
00:31:35,386 --> 00:31:38,006
We can examine what's
going on on a specific day.


582
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:39,836
If you look at the
top-left corner here,


583
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:41,576
you have dots below
some of these dates.


584
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:44,086
If I point on the
dates with dots,


585
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:46,646
and the dots are colored
according to my calendar colors,


586
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,296
I can see exactly what's going


587
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,326
on on those days
from which calendars.


588
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:51,406
That's pretty cool.


589
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,576
I don't have to collect and
examine and go into that day


590
00:31:53,576 --> 00:31:56,536
and look at what's
happening at that point.


591
00:31:57,106 --> 00:32:00,636
Fantastical 2 makes it super
easy to add new things,


592
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,566
new events or new reminders.


593
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:04,676
They support both
reminders and events.


594
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:08,176
So the way to add something
new is if you are in the app,


595
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:11,966
you tap this Add button, and now
you can use just simple English


596
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:15,316
language sentences, and they
have a natural language parser


597
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:19,076
that will just interpret
these and translate, you know,


598
00:32:19,076 --> 00:32:21,546
and interpret those into
the actual event details.


599
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,696
And as I type, I want you
to watch the extra attention


600
00:32:24,696 --> 00:32:26,826
to detail where, as it's
parsing, what I am doing,


601
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:29,406
it's going to be throwing
down dates and the times


602
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:34,236
into the spots in that field
in the form that appears.


603
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:40,656
So let's just do something
like meet with Ron tomorrow


604
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:45,016
at 6:00 p.m. for 30 minutes.


605
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,006
For example.


606
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,106
Boom. And there it is.


607
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:49,376
It knows what tomorrow means,


608
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:51,116
it knows what 30
minutes means, etcetera.


609
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,726
The app is localized
into nine languages,


610
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:56,146
and the natural language
parser works


611
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:57,626
in those nine languages as well.


612
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,656
So this is a really great
experience across the world


613
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:03,976
for people in many,
many countries.


614
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,316
You can also add events.


615
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:08,646
If you were in another
application, you could just go


616
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:12,136
up to the menu extra and
just add stuff up here,


617
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:13,636
so I could do something else,


618
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:22,126
like pick up sushi next
Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Boom.


619
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,356
And it throws the date in there,


620
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:24,736
puts it on my calendar,
and it's gone.


621
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:27,046
This little guy can
be torn off --


622
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,766
I wouldn't do this with the main
app running, but for the demo,


623
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,296
let me tear this off, and you
can have a Mini Window there


624
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:35,506
that's really handy to have
sticking around onscreen.


625
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:39,836
The other thing that they
do is that they've got --


626
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:42,126
Fantastical has got
multiple calendar sets,


627
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:46,086
and you can create work sets,
home sets, vacation sets,


628
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:47,736
whatever sets of
calendars you want,


629
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:52,246
and these calendars can have
multiple calendars within them,


630
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:55,716
and each set of calendars
can be activated at any time.


631
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:59,166
And not only that, you can go
in and say I want this calendar


632
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:02,116
to be activated on my
arrival at this location.


633
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,336
So I get to work, boom,
my calendar enables.


634
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:08,346
Or I get home, or I leave home
and some other calendar enables.


635
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:09,396
Very cool.


636
00:34:10,536 --> 00:34:13,406
So you can see that here when
you go into Manage Calendars,


637
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,186
you can go through, pick the
different ones you've got,


638
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,746
and you can automatically
activate


639
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:20,996
on a location that
you might want.


640
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,266
Fantastical does a
great job of toggling


641
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:29,275
between these calendars, and it
also supports a Today widget.


642
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,815
They have Share and
Action extensions.


643
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:34,606
They support geolocation.


644
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:38,626
They are deeply integrated
with OS X Yosemite,


645
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,255
and I just think it's a
tremendous productivity app.


646
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,775
You guys have done a fantastic
job and I think set the standard


647
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,416

00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:13,136
Workflow sets the standard
for what accessibility --


672
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:16,816
what apps should be doing in
terms of adopting accessibility,


673
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:19,966
to enable these apps
to be used by people


674
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:21,476
with vision impairment.


675
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:25,266
And I could do this
demo, but honestly,


676
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,036
it's far more impactful if
it is done by a colleague --


677
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:30,166
a few colleagues of mine


678
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,466
from the iOS accessibility
engineering team


679
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,686
who can really show you
how this thing is used.


680
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,496
So I would like to invite
Ryan and Dean on stage.


681
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:47,546
[ Applause ]


682
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:48,396
>> DEAN HUDSON: All right.


683
00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:52,936
My name is Dean Hudson, along
with my coworker, Ryan Dour.


684
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:55,976
We are quality engineers
on the Accessibility Team,


685
00:36:56,946 --> 00:37:01,376
and we're really excited
about the accessibility.


686
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:05,966
It's just amazing work that
the Workflow team has done


687
00:37:06,406 --> 00:37:08,426
in the Workflow app.


688
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:13,406
Apple is very deeply
committed to accessibility.


689
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:20,406
We have accessibility in all our
products, including iOS, OS X,


690
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:22,756
and now even the Watch.


691
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:26,496
But you know, today I want to
talk about VoiceOver in iOS.


692
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:28,356
Now, if you don't know,


693
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:30,906
VoiceOver is a built-in
screen reader


694
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:33,806
that allows visually
impaired users


695
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:37,086
to access iOS and your apps.


696
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:43,476
So you may be asking yourself,
well, how do I use VoiceOver?


697
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:43,846
What's that?


698
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:46,986
I mean -- to use
VoiceOver, you really need


699
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,086
to know three gestures --


700
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:52,416
touch, swipe, and
double-tap to activate.


701
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,226
In a moment, I am going to
have Ryan demo those gestures.


702
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:57,706
Let's talk about
touch, touch to explore.


703
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:01,466
It's a way for visually
impaired users


704
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:06,616
to safely navigate your apps in
iOS without activating anything.


705
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,936
And so they can get
the layout of the app.


706
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,746
And to demonstrate that,
I am going to ask Ryan


707
00:38:11,746 --> 00:38:13,276
to show you touch to explore.


708
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:17,566
>> Game Center.


709
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,326
Double-tap to open.


710
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:22,246
>> DEAN HUDSON: The second
gesture we have is swipe


711
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:27,606
to navigate, and this allows a
user to swipe through buttons,


712
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:30,966
UI elements within your
application sequentially,


713
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,776
either forwards or backwards,
with a single finger swipe.


714
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:34,496
Ryan?


715
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:36,126
>> iBooks.


716
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:40,226
Settings. Extras
folder to Workflow.


717
00:38:40,936 --> 00:38:41,866
Double-tap to open.


718
00:38:42,746 --> 00:38:44,896
>> DEAN HUDSON: Now, the third
gesture we have is double-tap.


719
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,756
Now, remember, with
VoiceOver on,


720
00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:49,546
touching is not going
to activate the item.


721
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,676
You have to use a double-tap.


722
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:55,026
What's interesting about
this gesture, though,


723
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,156
is you can have VoiceOver
focused on an element


724
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:01,746
and double-tap anywhere
else on the screen.


725
00:39:02,246 --> 00:39:03,226
And that's very unique.


726
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:06,996
It's very crucial for VoiceOver
users because it's hard to find


727
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,096
that focus area again.


728
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,366
And Ryan?


729
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:14,516
>> Workflow edit dimmed button.


730
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,076
Turns on Workflow editing mode.


731
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:21,266
>> DEAN HUDSON: So that's
VoiceOver, it's awesome, great,


732
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:25,156
we love it, we use it, but it's
really only half the story;


733
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:25,696
right?


734
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:30,056
You know, the other half is
what you, as a developer,


735
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,386
does in your apps to
make it accessible.


736
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:35,436
And it's using VoiceOver
together with accessibility


737
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:37,196
that makes a great
user experience.


738
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:40,996
Right now I am going to have
Ryan show the Workflow app


739
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:42,786
with accessibility
using VoiceOver.


740
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:46,056
>> RYAN DOUR: So as Dean
said, my name is Ryan Dour,


741
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:46,936
and I am going to take you


742
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:48,546
through Workflow
using VoiceOver.


743
00:39:48,876 --> 00:39:52,176
First I am going to go ahead
and start creating a Workflow.


744
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:54,826
You'll notice that
it's a visual button,


745
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,396
for me it's going
to speak a label.


746
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,366
Let's swipe over to our
right and see what it is.


747
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:01,546
>> Select Gallery button
to create Workflow button.

going to go ahead


750
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:06,676

754
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:13,536
>> RYAN DOUR: I think what
I want to do here, actually,


755
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:17,226
I would like to get my current
location, then I think I want


756
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:20,786
to turn it into a URL so I
can share it with friends.


757
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:23,256
Finally, I think I'll copy
to my clipboard, actually,


758
00:40:23,256 --> 00:40:25,116
so that it's easy to use
in a bunch of places.


759
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:26,936
Let's go ahead and start.


760
00:40:26,936 --> 00:40:29,676
I am going to touch
the thing I am looking


761
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:30,816
for on the left side here.


762
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:32,066
So I'm going to touch
this sidebar.

to pause the speech.

00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:37,746
Now I am going to swipe my way


767
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:39,936

that I would like.

added that first piece.

that they've added
those great hints?


785
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,416
They are fantastic.


786
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,016
It's basically a
self-described app.

And this time I am
just going to touch

this accessibility is cra-cra.

We go to the store, go
to the same App Store,

look at the same games,
applications, prices,


821
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,166
and we purchase and download
and open your app, it's amazing


822
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,556

842
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:42,096
and they became increasingly
attached to it.


843
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:44,936
While still the only two
employees, they have worked


844
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:49,286
with various contractors.


845
00:43:56,706 --> 00:44:00,296
>> SHAAN PRUDEN: Does Not
Commute is a strategic top-down


846
00:44:00,296 --> 00:44:00,916
driving game.


847
00:44:01,276 --> 00:44:03,816
What starts out as a relaxing
commute in a small town


848
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:06,676
in the '70s quickly
devolves into traffic chaos


849
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:08,606
with hot dog trucks,
school buses,


850
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:11,096
and dozens of other vehicles,
and you drive them all.


851
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:11,846
>> JOHN GELEYNSE: All right.


852
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:15,746
So this is the time
traveler's paradox


853
00:44:15,746 --> 00:44:19,336
in which you are
completing these challenges,


854
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:23,516
but as you drive -- as you try
to complete the challenges,


855
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:25,016
you are driving these
different vehicles,


856
00:44:25,016 --> 00:44:27,936
and every time you drive
one and maybe, you know,


857
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:30,846
veer off the road or whatever,
make a mistake or screw


858
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:34,846
up somehow, it's going to
get you in the next level.


859
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:36,996
And so if you succeed
well, you are great.


860
00:44:36,996 --> 00:44:39,906
If you screw up, you get caught,
and it comes back to haunt you


861
00:44:39,906 --> 00:44:44,956
because it's basically
this time paradox.


862
00:44:45,426 --> 00:44:50,416
So here we've got the app,
and we go in -- I am sorry.


863
00:44:50,996 --> 00:44:53,186
Here we are.


864
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:57,256
There's some really great
visual design here that kind


865
00:44:57,256 --> 00:44:59,186
of evokes the '60s and '70s.


866
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:03,036
I am on the main level here
to start, the simplest level


867
00:45:03,036 --> 00:45:04,866
for you if you have not
played the game before.


868
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,796
What you are doing is you've
got to follow this arrow,


869
00:45:07,796 --> 00:45:11,336
and you've got 60 seconds
to drive 13 commuters


870
00:45:11,406 --> 00:45:12,436
to their destinations.


871
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,906
So this first car, we'll
just tap and drive.


872
00:45:15,906 --> 00:45:18,526
At this point now it's
just right and left turns.


873
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:22,196
Right. Great.


874
00:45:22,196 --> 00:45:25,416
Not bad, 53, took me 7
seconds to do that one.


875
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:27,276
This next one's got to go.


876
00:45:27,616 --> 00:45:30,996
Watch the attention to detail
as the van kind of leans.


877
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:31,976
There is my first car.


878
00:45:32,436 --> 00:45:33,116
I better watch out.


879
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:34,206
Okay. Great.


880
00:45:34,206 --> 00:45:35,276
Not doing too bad.


881
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,836
The currency in this
game is time,


882
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:41,256
so if you ever see a
time token on the road,


883
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:42,526
you can just go pick that up.


884
00:45:43,046 --> 00:45:43,716
Okay. All right.


885
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:45,306
We are lucky here we are
on the second street.


886
00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:49,156
Notice it's replaying all of the
driving on my previous turns.


887
00:45:49,156 --> 00:45:49,406
All right.


888
00:45:49,406 --> 00:45:53,186
Now this is where it gets a
little screwy because -- whoops.


889
00:45:53,186 --> 00:45:54,786
Oh, man. Oh, man.


890
00:45:54,846 --> 00:45:58,696
Now, if I screw up,
I can hit the rewind


891
00:45:58,696 --> 00:46:00,336
in the corner, it backs up.


892
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:01,056
Okay. Here we go.


893
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:02,536
Let's try it again.


894
00:46:03,246 --> 00:46:04,336
All right, John, pay attention.


895
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:05,266

896
00:46:05,536 --> 00:46:07,756
Boom. Oh, we are good.

00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,286
Okay. Not bad.

Let's keep going.


904
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:22,926
Now it starts to
get a little scary


905
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:25,836
because I am driving an ice
cream truck, I could tip over,


906
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:27,296
and then the ice
cream would melt.


907
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,856
Okay. We are doing good.


908
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:31,476

pretty good, actually, today,

so I could cut through
here -- or not -- you know.

I am dropping oil.

if we could just get the volume


915
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,916
up a little bit on this,
this is pretty good

don't like me as a driver.

at home maybe with some
friends at a party.


1010
00:51:54,186 --> 00:51:58,466
So I am going to launch the
app and pick some songs here,


1011
00:51:58,826 --> 00:52:00,946
and let's pick this one.


1012
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,126
Play that.


1013
00:52:02,126 --> 00:52:04,266
See what it sounds like.


1014
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,376
We've got sound here.

00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:13,416
I don't know.


1017
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:14,326
That sounds kind of lame.


1018
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:15,266
There is something wrong here.


1019
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:18,596
Hold on a second.


1020
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,156
Something's not right.

[ Laughter ]


1022
00:52:25,436 --> 00:52:26,256
There. All right.


1023
00:52:26,866 --> 00:52:27,416
That's better.


1024
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:30,166
Okay. So let's add
another track here.


1025
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:34,796
Let's try this one,
Mogadishu, and let's move on


1026
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:36,736
and add another track here.


1027
00:52:36,926 --> 00:52:37,506
All right.


1028
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:38,896
So this is on iPhone; right?


1029
00:52:38,896 --> 00:52:41,846
And I can start a
track playing [music].


1030
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:45,336
Let's skip to the next one.


1031
00:52:45,586 --> 00:52:49,146
And it's going to
automatically merge the two


1032
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:52,076
of these tracks together
pretty quickly.


1033
00:52:52,076 --> 00:52:52,416
All right.


1034
00:52:52,576 --> 00:52:55,776
So we are in Mogadishu here,
and we can turn on the effects.


1035
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:59,796
Right on iPhone, we can start
doing some cool effects.

[ Music ]


1037
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:08,536
Okay. I can do a high-low.


1038
00:53:13,046 --> 00:53:14,646
I can do an 8-bit.


1039
00:53:18,046 --> 00:53:19,056
Right. Let's move
to the next song.


1040
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:21,446
It's going to do this
autopilot mixing.


1041
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:24,136
So you just say move
on to the next song.


1042
00:53:24,136 --> 00:53:25,766
It's got this animation
coming in.


1043
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:28,976
It's going to analyze the
beats, and then it's going


1044
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:31,566
to merge these two songs
together really nicely.


1045
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:41,146
Well, I sped that
up a little bit.


1046
00:53:41,316 --> 00:53:45,486
Sorry. Right, so you see the
effect that we've got here.


1047
00:53:45,486 --> 00:53:50,826
Right? So I can do some
white noise in the app.


1048
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:53,036
Then you've got that
happening on the iPhone.


1049
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,406
But they actually added
Apple Watch support,


1050
00:53:55,716 --> 00:54:00,386
so you can take your iPhone,
stick it in the stereo at home,


1051
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:04,756
and now pick up your watch, go
dancing with your friends --


1052
00:54:05,006 --> 00:54:06,776
let's switch to the Watch here.


1053
00:54:06,936 --> 00:54:09,256
Let's launch Pacemaker
on the Watch.


1054
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:17,056
We can add these effects.


1055
00:54:17,846 --> 00:54:20,526
And it knows exactly
which track is playing,


1056
00:54:21,096 --> 00:54:22,546
and so we can add
some white noise.


1057
00:54:23,116 --> 00:54:25,996
We can stop it.


1058
00:54:27,456 --> 00:54:30,606
We can add the chop.


1059
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:34,086
And you notice see the feedback
going right on the watch?


1060
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:37,846
It's all timed with the music
that's playing right now.


1061
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:40,976
I can add the 8-bit effect.


1062
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:49,836
I didn't say I was a DJ, but
you know, you get the point.


1063
00:54:50,306 --> 00:54:54,806
And I can apply the low filter
effect, and it will dip.


1064
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:57,976
And you see what's
going on on the watch.


1065
