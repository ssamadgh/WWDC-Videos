WorldCities

===========================================================================
ABSTRACT

"WorldCities" demonstrates basic use of MapKit, including displaying a map view and setting its region. A list of cities are stored in a plist file loaded at launch time.  Each city is represented by a "WorldCity" class which consists of a name, a latitude, and a longitude. The user can select from a pre-defined world cities. When a world cities is selected, the map view animates to a region with the coordinates of the world cities in the center of the view. The user can also choose between map types - Standard, Satellite, and Hybrid - using the segmented control in the toolbar of the main view.

Important:
The MapKit framework uses Google services to provide map data. Use of this class and the associated interfaces binds you to the Google Maps/Google Earth API terms of service. You can find these terms of service mentioned in the header section of "MKMapView.h".

===========================================================================
DISCUSSION

The MapViewController class and MapViewController.xib encapsulate all the interactions with the map view. These files are a good place to start to see how to set the region and map type of an MKMapView object.
