    File: SysSoundViewController.m
Abstract: This file does the work for SysSound--defining the sound to play and then playing
it when a user taps the System Sound button. Tapping the Alert Sound button invokes an alert as
performed by the device; for example, on an iPhone, it plays the sound and also invokes 
vibration. Tapping the Vibration button directly invokes vibration on devices that support it.
