00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:27,106
>> Good morning everyone.


4
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:27,916
Happy Friday.


5
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,516
My name is Skylar Peterson.


6
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:32,526
I am an engineer on the iOS


7
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:34,646
Accessibility team at Apple, and


8
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:36,496
with me today I have Bhavya, an


9
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:37,336
engineer on the Mac


10
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,596
accessibility team at Apple.


11
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:40,246
And together we're going to


12
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:42,376
delve into what it means to


13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,086
create an exceptional experience


14
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,566
in your app when it comes to


15
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,266
accessibility.


16
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:50,076
As a quick refresher, we tend to


17
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,286
think of accessibility as


18
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:53,756
meaning making technology usable


19
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:54,476
by everyone.


20
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:57,606
At Apple, we categorize the way


21
00:00:57,606 --> 00:00:59,286
in which we make that technology


22
00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:01,216
accessible into four areas of


23
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:06,616
focus, cognitive, motor, vision,


24
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:08,526
and hearing.


25
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:10,846
Now we have a bunch of great


26
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,326
features that we work on to


27
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,086
address all of these areas, but


28
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:16,396
at the end of the day, it's the


29
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,536
work that you do in tandem with


30
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,106
our assistive technologies that


31
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:21,796
make our platforms stellar


32
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:22,826
places for people with


33
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:23,536
disabilities.


34
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,866
Making sure that all the great


35
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,376
content you work on is


36
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,476
accessible to everyone creates a


37
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:31,636
better, more inclusive community


38
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:33,636
for all of us and fundamentally


39
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,186
improves the lives of millions


40
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,236
of people around the world.


41
00:01:37,976 --> 00:01:39,746
For today's talk, we're going to


42
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,666
skip past a lot of the basics of


43
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,876
making apps accessible.


44
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,026
However, if this is your first


45
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,966
exposure to accessibility or


46
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,116
you've never checked out any of


47
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,866
our accessibility APIs before,


48
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:51,526
then I highly recommend that you


49
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:52,876
check out some of the sessions


50
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:53,806
from last year's WWDC.


51
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:56,156
There's still a lot that you're


52
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,306
going to be able to gain from


53
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,016
our session.


54
00:01:58,366 --> 00:01:59,626
It may just feel like it's going


55
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:01,546
a little fast for you because


56
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:02,816
today we're going to focus on


57
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,456
going beyond the basics, and I


58
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,306
want to start by focusing in on


59
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,966
this one word, usable.


60
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,276
Usable is great, making sure


61
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:14,656
that all of the content of your


62
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,116
app is even visible to an


63
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:17,606
assistive technology is a


64
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:18,796
critical first step.


65
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:21,466
But when it comes down to it, we


66
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,036
don't want our apps to just be


67
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:24,196
usable, right.


68
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:25,786
No one's going to be out there


69
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,576
bragging that their app is


70
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:28,356
usable.


71
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:31,396
They want it to be exceptional.


72
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:33,696
We want people who use them to


73
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,296
be delighted when they do.


74
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,336
It may not be clear to you


75
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:38,926
exactly what that means when it


76
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,796
comes to accessibility, and


77
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:41,806
that's what we're here to talk


78
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:43,536
about today and hopefully


79
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,326
provide you with some helpful


80
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:46,836
guidance on how to do that.


81
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,286
I'd like to focus on two main


82
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,416
areas and the different


83
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,616
considerations that you'll want


84
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:54,666
to make for each when evaluating


85
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,196
the accessibility of your own


86
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:56,406
app.


87
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,336
First, visual design, and


88
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,956
second, the way that an


89
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,386
assistive technology user


90
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:03,796
experiences your app.


91
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,486
So let's start with visual


92
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:06,886
design.


93
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:12,766
I'd like to begin by addressing


94
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:14,116
transparency and blurring.


95
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:17,166
We use blur and transparency


96
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,126
across many parts of iOS.


97
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:21,616
It creates a vibrant, unique


98
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:22,956
look and feel for our operating


99
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:23,456
system.


100
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,426
But for some people,


101
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,646
particularly those with low


102
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,306
vision conditions, blur and


103
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:29,606
transparency can have negative


104
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,856
impacts on legibility and even


105
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,436
cause a degree of eye strain.


106
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:35,476
So we provide an accessibility


107
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:36,786
setting to reduce blur and


108
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,516
transparency, and it can have


109
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:41,106
dramatic effects like this.


110
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:42,836
Instead of blurring the


111
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:44,686
backdrop, we fade it so that you


112
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:46,216
still have the context of where


113
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:48,216
you are in the system, but the


114
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:50,166
visual noise is reduced, and the


115
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,566
controls which before had color


116
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,076
bleed-in from behind are more


117
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:54,536
legible on their solid backdrop.


118
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,926
Same with folders and finally


119
00:03:58,926 --> 00:03:59,456
spotlight.


120
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:02,276
Now this is a particularly good


121
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,936
example, because we've taken a


122
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:05,746
sample of the user's wallpaper


123
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:06,936
so that we can color the


124
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,486
backdrop, and they could still


125
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:10,396
feel personalized and contextual


126
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:12,176
to the device, but we still get


127
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:13,616
that increased contrast and


128
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,306
legibility of having a solid


129
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:15,756
background.


130
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:18,776
As a developer, you can cater


131
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,065
your own use of blurring and


132
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,846
transparency by checking whether


133
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,106
or not the reduced transparency


134
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,676
setting is enabled and adapting


135
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:25,596
your UI accordingly.


136
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:28,136
On iOS, you would use is reduce


137
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,866
transparency enabled on UI


138
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,576
accessibility, and on macOS,


139
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:34,326
accessibility display should


140
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,116
reduce transparency on NS


141
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:36,706
Workspace.


142
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,656
Next, I'd like to talk about


143
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,436
contrast.


144
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:43,756
Contrast between content and


145
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,486
it's background is hugely


146
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,506
important when it comes to


147
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:47,456
perceivability.


148
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:49,546
As colors get closer to one


149
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,106
another, they become more


150
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:52,406
difficult to distinguish.


151
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:54,886
As well, certain colors that are


152
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:56,756
legible at bigger sizes don't


153
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,056
work when content is scaled


154
00:04:58,056 --> 00:04:58,436
down.


155
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:00,296
For example, with text, the


156
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:01,586
letters bleed together more


157
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,106
easily at smaller sizes.


158
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,026
Now you can compute the contrast


159
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,816
ratio between a particular color


160
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,436
combination to see whether or


161
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,886
not it's going to be legible,


162
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,046
and we followed the


163
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,406
recommendations laid out in the


164
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:14,796
web content accessibility


165
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:16,506
guidelines that states that the


166
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,296
minimum contrast ratio you


167
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,756
should aim for is 4.5 to 1.


168
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:23,836
Obviously, the highest contrast


169
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:24,766
that you're going to be able to


170
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,206
get is between black and white,


171
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:28,876
which comes out to be 21 to 1


172
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,566
and obviously works great at all


173
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:31,356
text sizes.


174
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,176
Now let's take a look at a shade


175
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:33,606
of gray.


176
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,386
This particular gray will work


177
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,506
great for larger text, but it


178
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,966
isn't so great for smaller text


179
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:40,996
because your eyes can't


180
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:41,966
distinguish the shapes of the


181
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,676
letter forms.


182
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:45,566
It's contrast ratio 4.5 to 1 is


183
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,246
right on the line of passable.


184
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:49,346
Let's like take a look at one


185
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:49,906
last gray.


186
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:52,686
It may not be apparent on this


187
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,926
really large display, but this


188
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,926
text is really hard to see on a


189
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,806
small device, even at a large


190
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:00,576
font size.


191
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,216
It's contrast ratio of 2.9 to 1


192
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:04,676
is just too low.


193
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:09,486
And you can use the built-in


194
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,106
tool in our accessibility


195
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,926
inspector in Xcode to show you


196
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,916
what the contrast ratio between


197
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:17,896
a particular color combination


198
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,856
is and what text sizes that


199
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,276
color combo passes for.


200
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,386
And we follow the same


201
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:23,456
guidelines that I mentioned


202
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:24,386
before in this tool.


203
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,016
However, even with a ratio that


204
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,736
exceeds the recommended contrast


205
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,766
ratio of 4.5 to 1, for people


206
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,186
with low vision conditions,


207
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:35,906
colors that meet the bar can


208
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:37,216
still be problematic when it


209
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,196
comes to legibility.


210
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,626
So we provide a setting for


211
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:42,266
increasing the contrast across


212
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:42,826
the system.


213
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,016
In previous versions of iOS,


214
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:46,646
this setting was referred to as


215
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:47,616
darken colors.


216
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,506
So in your code you can use is


217
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:51,236
darker system colors enabled to


218
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:51,616
check.


219
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:52,896
Though if you're using a


220
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,696
standard UIKit control that you


221
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,516
set a tint color on, you will


222
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,786
actually get this work for free.


223
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,646
On a macOS, you can use


224
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,226
accessibility display should


225
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:03,266
increase contrast.


226
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:06,566
Next we have sizing.


227
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:09,956
Changing the content size of


228
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:11,786
your device can have dramatic


229
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,046
effects in the way that content


230
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:15,296
is displayed and perceived.


231
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,266
And this is hugely beneficial to


232
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,266
low vision users.


233
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,036
So let's take for example a


234
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:20,666
calendar.


235
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:22,916
On the left, we have this view


236
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,756
at the default text size, and on


237
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:26,036
the right I've blown it up


238
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,566
several sizes to one of the


239
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,136
larger accessibility sizes.


240
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:30,896
If we simulate what this looks


241
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:31,866
like to someone with a low


242
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,566
vision condition, then the


243
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,176
benefits become immediately


244
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:35,676
apparent.


245
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,326
That text on the right is


246
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,546
actually still legible.


247
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:41,916
On iOS, you can check what


248
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,386
content size a user has set


249
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:44,856
their device to, and there are


250
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,866
seven standard sizes with large


251
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,056
being the default, but you can


252
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:50,406
also enable even larger


253
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,826
accessibility sizes, which


254
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,146
increase that by five more.


255
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,866
Now there's a lot more that I


256
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,296
could say about dynamic type,


257
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:59,246
but I'm going to leave it at


258
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,486
that and instead encourage you


259
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:01,296
to check out some of the


260
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:03,186
fantastic resources that we have


261
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:04,726
to figure out the best way to


262
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,566
get dynamic type working in your


263
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:07,856
own apps.


264
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:11,026
Now for some, changing the size


265
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,296
of text is overkill, but the


266
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:15,246
default weight of fonts and


267
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,526
glyphs can still make it


268
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:17,396
difficult to read.


269
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,616
So on iOS there's a setting for


270
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,486
enabling bold text, which will


271
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:22,806
also increase the stroke weight


272
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:23,436
of glyphs.


273
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:26,566
If you're using stand built-in


274
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,816
UI controls and a system font,


275
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:30,386
then it's likely that you don't


276
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,866
need to do anything to get bold


277
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:34,166
text working in your app, but if


278
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,256
you're using your own text


279
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:37,756
solution or a custom font, or


280
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:38,996
you simply want to do something


281
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,696
like making the dividing lines


282
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:41,996
in your app thicker when bold


283
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,826
text is on, then you can check


284
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:44,646
whether or not the setting is


285
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,336
enabled and adapt as necessary.


286
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:50,096
Next, we have motion.


287
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:53,606
Animation is fun, and it often


288
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,096
makes content feel more alive.


289
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:57,006
It can provide a direct


290
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,976
correlation between user


291
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:00,876
interaction and what effects


292
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,076
their actions are having.


293
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:04,316
However, certain conditions,


294
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,516
particularly inner ear


295
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,236
conditions that affect the


296
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:09,116
balance center of the brain can


297
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,426
make motion and animation


298
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,786
problematic, which often results


299
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,416
in things like dizziness or


300
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,916
imbalance or even nausea.


301
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:18,876
Now I'm going to go through some


302
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:20,396
examples of animation types that


303
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,636
can be problematic, so if any of


304
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:23,556
you in the audience have a


305
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,316
problem with motion, then you


306
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,266
may want to look away


307
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,256
momentarily as I play the


308
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,836
default animations, which I am


309
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:29,806
going to preface.


310
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,876
The first is scaling and


311
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:33,466
zooming.


312
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,656
On the left, we have the default


313
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:36,936
animation for opening an app,


314
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,736
specifically the clock app,


315
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,106
which I'm going to show now.


316
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,156
We zoom into the location of the


317
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:45,176
app's icon while it's UI scales


318
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:45,756
into view.


319
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:47,286
And on the right, we have the


320
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,856
same interaction but with reduce


321
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,556
motion enabled, which will


322
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,186
replace that with a simple cross


323
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:52,966
fade.


324
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,306
Next, spinning and vortex


325
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:56,776
effects.


326
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:58,826
If we take a look at the full


327
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:00,726
screen echo effect in messages,


328
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,756
which I'm going to show now, we


329
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,336
can see that content is spinning


330
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,006
along the Z axis while also


331
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,816
changing in scale, and these


332
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,096
types of motions paired together


333
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,116
can cause issues.


334
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,556
In the case of message effects,


335
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,006
if reduced motion is enabled,


336
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,476
then we provide the user with a


337
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,086
specific prompt to play the


338
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:19,786
message effect instead of having


339
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,506
it autoplay.


340
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,426
So they can choose whether or


341
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,076
not they want to see it.


342
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:25,556
Next, we have plane-shifting


343
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:26,316
animations.


344
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,116
What I want to show here is the


345
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:29,616
Safari tabs animation.


346
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,336
So I'm going to tap on the show


347
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,346
tabs button, and you see that


348
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:34,786
the plane of the web cards is


349
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:36,726
shifted to simulate a 3D space.


350
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:38,696
And on the right, we have the


351
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,486
reduced animation, which again


352
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:42,536
is a simple cross fade, but we


353
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:44,996
also blink the card so that you


354
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:46,666
have the context of which one


355
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,536
you're coming from that you got


356
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:53,000
in the original animation.


357
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,186
Multidirectional or multispeed


358
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:57,636
motion is another trigger.


359
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,496
I'm going to show the movement


360
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:00,646
of the messages bubbles in a


361
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:01,466
conversation.


362
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,286
It's a little hard to see in


363
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:04,416
this video, but it's a lot more


364
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,516
obvious on device.


365
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:08,306
As I scroll the messages, they


366
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,916
have a springiness to them where


367
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,196
they contract and expand away


368
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,576
from one another.


369
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:15,866
If we have reduce motion


370
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,706
enabled, then we disable this


371
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,236
effect and have them just scroll


372
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:19,636
normally.


373
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,486
Finally, we have peripheral


374
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:25,006
movement.


375
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,536
The weather app on iOS has


376
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,106
subtle animations that play in


377
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,756
the background to indicate the


378
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,166
current weather condition.


379
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:33,596
You cans see on the left that


380
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:35,146
the clouds are sort of drifting


381
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,296
through the air and the sun is


382
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,416
sort of shimmering and shining.


383
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:39,816
But if you're scanning the


384
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,086
forecast below, then this


385
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,026
animation is in your peripheral


386
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,526
view, and this can be


387
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:46,226
problematic in the same way that


388
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:48,176
reading while riding in a car


389
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,406
can make you feel sick.


390
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,656
The horizontal motion above your


391
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,036
area of focus triggers a


392
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:54,386
reaction in your brain.


393
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:56,806
With reduced motion on, we


394
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:57,686
disable the background


395
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:58,276
animation.


396
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:01,326
Now typically we don't want to


397
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,766
just remove all animation, so of


398
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:04,576
course we have a setting that


399
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:05,816
you can check to see if motion


400
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,566
should be reduced and adapt


401
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:08,186
accordingly.


402
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:10,596
On iOS, you check is reduced


403
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,926
motion enabled, and on macOS,


404
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,606
check accessibility display


405
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:15,606
should reduce motion.


406
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,046
It's important to note that


407
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,936
simply removing an animation is


408
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,216
often not an adequate


409
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,076
experience.


410
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,966
You don't want to lessen the


411
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:24,686
experience.


412
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:27,156
You just want to add something


413
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,806
else equally fun or engaging but


414
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:29,876
different that works for the


415
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:30,266
user.


416
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:33,416
Finally, I'd like to finish


417
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,586
talking about design by


418
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,306
addressing UI complexity.


419
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,236
Apps play key roles in our lives


420
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,696
now, and it's critically


421
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:42,366
important for all of us that our


422
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,246
technology is simple and easy to


423
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,646
use, that it enhances our lives


424
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:47,856
instead of adding extra


425
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:48,836
unnecessary burden.


426
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:52,336
In the United States alone, one


427
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,336
in six children have a


428
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,276
developmental disability ranging


429
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,306
from speech and language


430
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:58,016
impairments to more serious


431
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,306
developmental disabilities like


432
00:12:59,306 --> 00:12:59,896
autism.


433
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:01,696
For people with cognitive


434
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,446
disabilities or even a chronic


435
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:06,156
illness, using an app can expend


436
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,716
more energy than for someone who


437
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:08,526
is neurotypical.


438
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,116
So how do we make sure that our


439
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,686
apps are simple and the least


440
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:13,826
burdensome that they can be?


441
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,596
Well they should be easy to


442
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,936
navigate by having them


443
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:19,696
similarly structured and through


444
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,676
clear, logical cause and effect.


445
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:24,496
We should be able to start using


446
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:26,136
our apps and complete the most


447
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:27,496
common tasks without


448
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:28,946
encountering any barriers.


449
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:31,506
And finally, our apps should


450
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,756
behave in a consistent manner so


451
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,076
that when I learn something one


452
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:36,976
place, it applies to another.


453
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,366
Using this standard UIKit views


454
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:40,906
is great because people get


455
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:43,416
familiar with way they work, but


456
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,166
UIKit also functions as a design


457
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,256
language for iOS.


458
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:47,666
So if you're doing something


459
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,566
custom, consistency with a


460
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,966
parallel control in UIKit will


461
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,336
help people intuit how to use


462
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,186
your app.


463
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,496
This really all boils down to


464
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:57,486
the way in which people


465
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,326
experience your apps, which is


466
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,506
just as important for people who


467
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
use assistive technologies like


468
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,236
VoiceOver or Switch Control.


469
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:05,486
So I'd like now to spend some


470
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:06,616
time speaking to how you can


471
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,216
improve the experience for those


472
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,426
accessibility users.


473
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:12,306
The experience for assistive


474
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,796
tech like VoiceOver and Switch


475
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:15,346
Control can be quite different


476
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,476
from your typical user


477
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:17,256
experience.


478
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,326
VoiceOver uses many gestures


479
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,256
like swipes and multifinger


480
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:22,556
taps,


481
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,806
while Switch Control scans


482
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,516
groups and offers logical quick


483
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:29,256
actions.


484
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:31,386
For both, there are built-in


485
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:32,756
equivalents for any standard


486
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:35,626
gesture or interaction, but what


487
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,086
makes experiencing an app with


488
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,446
these technologies exceptional?


489
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:40,486
We want to go from the bare


490
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:43,576
minimum of it works to it works


491
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:43,896
well.


492
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:46,736
While despite the fact that


493
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,486
assistive tech users experience


494
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:49,996
your app in ways that are


495
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:51,756
different, the same design


496
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,256
principles that drive a good


497
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:53,976
experience for a


498
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,646
nonaccessibility user applies


499
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:55,906
here.


500
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,146
You want easy navigation,


501
00:14:58,526 --> 00:14:59,726
predictable behavior,


502
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:02,386
prioritizing our action, and


503
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:02,996
consistency.


504
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,606
It's also important to note that


505
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:06,966
if something is communicated


506
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,416
contextually by separate


507
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,496
elements, that same context is


508
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:11,636
conveyed to our accessibility


509
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:12,166
users.


510
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,726
I'd like now to bring Bhavya up


511
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:16,646
on stage to run through a quick


512
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:17,836
audit of the accessibility


513
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,426
experience of an app.


514
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:19,706
Bhavya.


515
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:24,986
[ Applause ]


516
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:26,176
>> Good morning, everyone.


517
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,726
My name is Bhavya, and I'm a


518
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,586
software engineer on the


519
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:29,776
Accessibility team at Apple.


520
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:31,886
Today, I'd like to talk to you


521
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:32,806
about enhancing the


522
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,096
accessibility experience of your


523
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:35,936
app by sharing with you an app


524
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:36,856
that Skyler and I have been


525
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:37,466
working on.


526
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:39,296
The name of this app is


527
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:41,186
Exceptional Dogs, and the goal


528
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:42,756
is to help make the dog adoption


529
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,896
process easier by allowing users


530
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:46,226
to browse a collection of dogs


531
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:47,296
who are in need of a loving


532
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:47,626
home.


533
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's take a look at this app.


534
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:57,866
This is Exceptional Dogs.


535
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,406
At the top, I have a carousel


536
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,216
like UI, which is essentially a


537
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:03,346
collection view of all the


538
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:04,206
different dogs that I can


539
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:04,506
browse.


540
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:06,946
In the bottom left corner, I


541
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,156
have a favorite button so that I


542
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:09,456
can favorite particular dogs I


543
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:11,246
like, and in the bottom right


544
00:16:11,246 --> 00:16:12,726
corner, I have a gallery button,


545
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,226
which brings up a modal view


546
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:15,516
with additional photos of the


547
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,000
dog.


548
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:20,026
However, not all dogs have a


549
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:20,736
gallery button.


550
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,546
Notice how this button fades


551
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:25,156
away as swipe to Layla, who has


552
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:26,046
no additional pictures.


553
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,026
Beneath the carousel I have a


554
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:30,476
stats view with information


555
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:31,956
about the dog like its name and


556
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:32,336
breed.


557
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,236
Notice how this information


558
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:35,836
updates as I swipe to the next


559
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:36,546
dog in the carousel.


560
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:40,476
Finally, at the bottom I have


561
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:41,806
the name of the shelter with two


562
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:42,946
buttons which can open the


563
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,366
location of the shelter in maps


564
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:48,976
or call the location.


565
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:51,266
So there's quite a bit going on


566
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,106
here in terms of visual


567
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:54,676
complexity, but Skyler and I


568
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:56,236
done our due diligence, and


569
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:57,556
we've sprinkled in a little bit


570
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,526
of accessibility, just enough to


571
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:00,586
make sure that VoiceOver can


572
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,936
reach every element on screen.


573
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,596
So let's turn on VoiceOver now


574
00:17:04,935 --> 00:17:06,846
and see how a nonsighted or low


575
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:09,236
vision user would digest all of


576
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:12,000
this complexity.


577
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:15,846
>> VoiceOver on.


578
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,205
Exceptional Dogs.


579
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,165
Pinky.


580
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:20,126
>> So VoiceOver lands on the


581
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,396
image and correctly announces


582
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,116
the name of the dog.


583
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:22,836
Great.


584
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,965
I'm going to swipe from left to


585
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:26,016
right now to scroll through the


586
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:26,496
carousel.


587
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,946
>> Layla, Bro, Pudding.


588
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:34,156
Favorite off button, Pudding,


589
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,176
Bro.


590
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,056
>> So VoiceOver was able to


591
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,096
correctly scroll through the


592
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:40,276
carousel, but we weren't able to


593
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:41,656
reach the favorite button until


594
00:17:41,656 --> 00:17:42,486
we hit the very end of the


595
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:43,016
carousel.


596
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,176
I could, of course, still get to


597
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:46,416
the favorite button by placing


598
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,656
my finger on it like this.


599
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,436
>> Favorite off button.


600
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:51,656
>> But it's important to


601
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:52,976
remember that this is not how a


602
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:54,006
typical VoiceOver user


603
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,606
navigates.


604
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:57,296
Rather, VoiceOver users swipe to


605
00:17:57,296 --> 00:17:58,936
reach to the next element, and


606
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,076
currently, using swiping we


607
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,006
aren't able to reach the


608
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:03,376
favorite or gallery buttons


609
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:04,496
until we hit the very end of the


610
00:18:04,496 --> 00:18:04,976
carousel.


611
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:06,556
This isn't a great or


612
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:08,066
exceptional experience because


613
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,526
it really limits my ability to


614
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:10,896
favorite or view the galleries


615
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,326
for virtually all of the dogs in


616
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:12,866
the carousel.


617
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,366
I'll place my finger over the


618
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,936
modal view now to activate the


619
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:17,596
gallery button.


620
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,186
>> Show gallery.


621
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:20,376
Show gallery.


622
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:22,006
Picture one of Bro.


623
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:22,816
Image.


624
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:24,596
>> Let's scroll through our


625
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:24,826
gallery.


626
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:26,516
>> Picture two of Bro.


627
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,356
Picture three of Bro.


628
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:29,576
Pinky.


629
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:31,126
Layla.


630
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:34,086
>> So, we were successfully able


631
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,096
to scroll through the gallery


632
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:36,916
with VoiceOver but focus went


633
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,366
behind the modal view to the


634
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,496
content in the background.


635
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,286
This experience might seem


636
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,626
workable because it gets the


637
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,786
user to the content that they


638
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,736
need to, but it's not great or


639
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:47,306
exceptional because allowing


640
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:48,596
focus to go behind the modal


641
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,046
view is confusing and


642
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,096
distracting for the user.


643
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:53,356
I elected the modal view now by


644
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:56,326
double tapping on the close


645
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:56,896
button.


646
00:18:56,996 --> 00:18:58,516
>> Close, Layla.


647
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,296
>> Let's swipe through our stats


648
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:01,446
view.


649
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:07,766
>> Name, breed, Layla, Labrador.


650
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:10,596
>> When I hear a name, I expect


651
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:11,686
to hear the actual name of the


652
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,646
dog right after, but instead I


653
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:14,166
hear breed.


654
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:16,716
Visually, the layout of all this


655
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:19,036
information makes sense, but to


656
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:21,086
VoiceOver, its structure causes


657
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:22,356
it to announce information out


658
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:22,786
of order.


659
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:24,766
This creates a lack of context


660
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,926
for the user and places


661
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:27,346
unnecessary cognitive load on


662
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:27,496
them.


663
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:30,326
I'll place my finger over the


664
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,376
name of the shelter now and


665
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:32,746
swipe to the buttons next to it.


666
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,206
>> Skyler's animal shelter.


667
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,666
Open address in maps.


668
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:38,556
Button.


669
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:39,396
Call.


670
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:40,186
Button.


671
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,156
>> Once again, these buttons are


672
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:43,396
perfectly accessible like the


673
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:45,176
labels from the stat view, yet


674
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:46,256
they lack context.


675
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,826
When I hear call, it isn't clear


676
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:49,946
to me what this call action is


677
00:19:49,946 --> 00:19:51,576
referring to even though


678
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:53,116
visually this is pretty evident


679
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,186
since the call button is right


680
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,306
next to the name of the shelter.


681
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,286
>> VoiceOver off.


682
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:02,076
>> So we found a couple of


683
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:02,576
issues here.


684
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,086
These issues don't completely


685
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,086
render our app unusable, but


686
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,516
they do place unnecessary


687
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:09,816
cognitive load on the user.


688
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,226
Remember, our goal here is to


689
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:13,376
create an exceptional


690
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:14,796
accessibility experience.


691
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:16,756
I'd like to invite Skyler back


692
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,306
to the stage now to talk about


693
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,356
how we can elevate our


694
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:20,866
experience for Exceptional Dogs


695
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,176
to be exceptional.


696
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:28,236
[ Applause ]


697
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,066
>> So we found some issues with


698
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:30,486
our app.


699
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:32,316
So let's take a look at some of


700
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,666
our accessibility API that we


701
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,016
can leverage to resolve them.


702
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:37,906
From Bhavya's audit, we found


703
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:39,276
some issues with our carousel.


704
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:41,196
We could get to the favorite and


705
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:42,846
gallery buttons but only after


706
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:43,976
reaching the end of the list


707
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,096
instead of for each individual


708
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:45,446
dog.


709
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,386
As well, we couldn't get to that


710
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:49,196
display data below for the dog


711
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,076
until reaching the end of the


712
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:50,536
list.


713
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,256
We need the actions and data for


714
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:54,306
each dog to be quickly


715
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:54,806
reachable.


716
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,246
So what we can do is use UI


717
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,056
accessibility element to create


718
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,766
a new element in place of the


719
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:02,476
collection view.


720
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:04,696
UI accessibility element is a


721
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,406
class used to create custom


722
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:08,356
elements oftentimes for


723
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:09,606
representing parts of your UI


724
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:10,726
that are inaccessible, like


725
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,036
something you've drawn in Core


726
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:12,986
Graphics for instance.


727
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:15,976
But we can also leverage it to


728
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,436
create a custom experience,


729
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,386
which is what we're going to do


730
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:18,966
in this case.


731
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,576
We'll need to return any custom


732
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,246
elements from the accessibility


733
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,806
elements property for the view


734
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:25,696
that would contain them.


735
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,216
This tells our assistive


736
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:30,686
technology what the accessible


737
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:32,596
sub elements of a given view are


738
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:33,806
and the order that they should


739
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:34,456
be navigable.


740
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:37,746
So if we get our custom element


741
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:39,186
in place, we can swipe to the


742
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,386
content for each dog easily.


743
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:40,786
Great.


744
00:21:41,546 --> 00:21:43,606
But then how do we change dogs?


745
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:46,326
Well, we can take advantage of


746
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:47,596
accessibility increment and


747
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:48,866
accessibility decrement.


748
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:50,966
By adding the adjustable trait


749
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:52,936
to our custom element, we'll let


750
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,386
the assistive technique know


751
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:55,756
that our element responds to


752
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,376
these callbacks so that in the


753
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,286
case of VoiceOver when a user


754
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,586
swipes up or down with their


755
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,076
finger, then the collection view


756
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,126
will scroll to the next or


757
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:05,446
previous item.


758
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,866
Now, next let's take a look at


759
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,066
these information labels.


760
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:10,716
When Bhavya was swiping through


761
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:12,196
them, they were out of order,


762
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:13,506
and the value labels lack the


763
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,976
context of what information they


764
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:15,606
were providing.


765
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:18,846
Context is hugely important.


766
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:20,566
If I just touch on the value


767
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:21,796
label for whether or not the dog


768
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:23,536
is fostered, all I'm going to


769
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:25,216
hear from VoiceOver is yes.


770
00:22:25,816 --> 00:22:27,036
Well, yes what?


771
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:28,486
What does that mean?


772
00:22:28,486 --> 00:22:29,646
What does that correspond to?


773
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:32,096
As well, we have an issue with


774
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:32,896
navigation.


775
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:34,466
We're looking at having to swipe


776
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,396
through 14 different labels just


777
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,646
to find what we're looking for.


778
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,446
But combining them would cut


779
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:41,096
that in half and makes


780
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:43,026
navigation much, much faster.


781
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,796
It makes more sense to group


782
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:46,946
these labels together as a


783
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:48,496
single element so that I


784
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:49,586
understand the relationship


785
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:50,716
between label and value.


786
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:52,406
We again can use UI


787
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:53,656
accessibility element to


788
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:55,146
accomplish this by creating


789
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:56,836
elements for each pair of labels


790
00:22:56,946 --> 00:22:58,026
and returning them from the


791
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,526
containing views accessibility


792
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:00,346
elements property.


793
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,706
We also saw that when Bhavya was


794
00:23:03,706 --> 00:23:04,606
swiping through elements in the


795
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,466
app that the shelter info view


796
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:08,026
was split up into three distinct


797
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,346
elements, the name of the


798
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,986
shelter, the location button,


799
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:11,776
and a call button.


800
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:14,986
The buttons have the same issue


801
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:16,816
of lacking contexts as labels.


802
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:18,866
If you reach them first without


803
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:19,466
reaching the name of the


804
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,146
shelter, then it's unclear what


805
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,066
they correspond to.


806
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:24,746
Having these three elements


807
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,396
exist separately increases the


808
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:27,666
amount of elements that a user


809
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,536
is going to have to navigate


810
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:29,536
through to find the content


811
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,246
they're looking for.


812
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:31,736
So it makes more sense to


813
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,556
combine them into one and give


814
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:34,586
us quicker navigation.


815
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,256
As well, we want to think about


816
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:38,616
what the priority is here.


817
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,236
The most relevant piece of


818
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:41,586
information is what shelter the


819
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,546
dog is housed in.


820
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:44,716
So we'll provide that first and


821
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,206
add supplementary actions for


822
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,206
locating and calling the


823
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:47,656
shelter.


824
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:50,476
To accomplish this, we can use


825
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:52,096
our accessibility custom actions


826
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:52,396
API.


827
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,096
This allows us to add actions to


828
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:56,276
an element that the user can


829
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,106
cycle through until they find


830
00:23:58,106 --> 00:23:59,206
the one they're looking for and


831
00:23:59,206 --> 00:23:59,826
activate it.


832
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:01,896
You can return an array of


833
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,886
custom actions for a given view,


834
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:06,726
and then for each action, you


835
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,356
have a name, which is conveyed


836
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:09,626
to the user as what's going to


837
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:11,116
happen when they activate that


838
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,666
action, and a target selector


839
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,446
relationship, which will execute


840
00:24:15,446 --> 00:24:17,586
the action in your code.


841
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:19,056
So we'll make that whole shelter


842
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:20,696
view accessible and add custom


843
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:21,626
actions to it for getting the


844
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,056
location and calling.


845
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:25,496
Finally, we have the gallery


846
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:25,776
view.


847
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:28,186
When Bhavya brought this up, we


848
00:24:28,186 --> 00:24:29,386
could swipe through all of the


849
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,936
elements in the background, and


850
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,746
though this view apps modal,


851
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:36,326
that isn't the case, because


852
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:37,966
instead of housing this view in


853
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,336
a view controller and presenting


854
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,466
it modally, we instead opted to


855
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,146
just add it on top of a view


856
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:43,766
hierarchy.


857
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,506
And so since the content in the


858
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:48,106
background is still visible,


859
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:49,786
VoiceOver doesn't know that it


860
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:50,516
should exclude it.


861
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:52,736
Although everything in the


862
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,046
gallery is accessible to


863
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:56,006
VoiceOver, it gets confusing to


864
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:57,996
the user whose lost the context


865
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,136
of where they are and what


866
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,566
effect their actions are having.


867
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:03,536
To fix this, we want to override


868
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,906
accessibility view is modal on


869
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:07,356
the presented view, which will


870
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:08,656
tell our assistive technology


871
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:10,126
that only the elements of that


872
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:11,256
view should be accessible right


873
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:11,486
now.


874
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:14,196
We'll also want to post a


875
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:15,476
notification to let the


876
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,846
assistive technology know that


877
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:18,006
our on-screen elements have


878
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:19,306
changed and that it should


879
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:20,446
attempt to refocus.


880
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:23,006
We can use the screen change


881
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:24,116
notification to do so.


882
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:27,296
I'm going to turn things back


883
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,886
over to Bhavya now to show you


884
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:30,256
how to use all the API we just


885
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:31,196
covered to implement our


886
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:31,786
solutions.


887
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:32,666
Bhavya?


888
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:38,546
[ Applause ]


889
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:39,476
Thanks Skyler.


890
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:41,216
Let's elevate accessibility


891
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,756
experience of our app from great


892
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:43,836
to exceptional.


893
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:45,000
I'll jump into Xcode.


894
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:54,346
Let's start with enhancing the


895
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:55,826
experience of the carousel at


896
00:25:55,826 --> 00:25:56,136
the top.


897
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,376
Here, I have a class called Dog


898
00:25:58,376 --> 00:25:59,906
Carousel Container view which


899
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,296
houses our collection view of


900
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:02,876
the dogs, our favorite button,


901
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,016
and our gallery button.


902
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:06,096
As Skyler mentioned, we'd like


903
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:07,166
to implement the increment and


904
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,616
decrement functionality so that


905
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:09,996
we can swipe up and down to


906
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:10,986
scroll through our carousel.


907
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:13,146
To do this, we can create a


908
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:14,946
property on this class called


909
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:16,416
carousel accessibility element,


910
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:18,276
which will be a custom UI


911
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,516
accessibility element that


912
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:20,676
supports those gestures.


913
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:23,496
Let's implement carousel


914
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:24,466
accessibility element.


915
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:30,336
This will be a subclass of UI


916
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:31,376
accessibility element.


917
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:33,136
It also needs to know about the


918
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:34,216
current dog object it's


919
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:35,476
representing, so let's create a


920
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:36,846
property for that.


921
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,556
We'll give it an initializer


922
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:43,766
also, and let's give it some


923
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:45,306
basic accessibility like the


924
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:48,926
label and the value.


925
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,476
Our label will be dog picker,


926
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,386
and the value will be a


927
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:53,476
combination of the name of the


928
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:55,226
dog and it's favorited status.


929
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:59,046
Okay. Let's get into the


930
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,196
increment and decrement


931
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:00,916
functionality.


932
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:02,836
First, we'd like to override


933
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:04,396
accessibility traits to return


934
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:08,826
the adjustable trait.


935
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,086
Let's first implement


936
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,096
accessibility increment.


937
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:16,366
We want our increment function


938
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:17,616
to scroll the collection view


939
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:17,996
forward.


940
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:19,536
So let's create a function that


941
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:19,976
does exactly that.


942
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,126
Here, I have a function called


943
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:30,606
accessibility scroll collection


944
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:30,806
view.


945
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:32,926
It takes in a bullion, which


946
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:34,036
determines if the collection


947
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,196
view will scroll forwards or


948
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:35,746
backwards.


949
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:37,786
Let's dive into this function.


950
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:39,866
I get a reference to my


951
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,256
container view, my current dog,


952
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:44,086
and my list of all the dogs.


953
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,176
If I'm moving forwards, I get


954
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:49,116
the index of my current dog, and


955
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:50,796
I validate that it doesn't


956
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:53,326
exceed out of bounds, and if


957
00:27:53,326 --> 00:27:54,896
doesn't, I'll ask my collection


958
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:55,906
view to scroll forward by one


959
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:56,366
index.


960
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:58,696
I'll do something similar if I'm


961
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:01,006
going backwards except I'll make


962
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:02,206
sure that my index won't become


963
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:04,566
negative, and then I'll ask my


964
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:05,446
collection view to scroll


965
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:06,706
backwards by one index.


966
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,276
Let's go ahead and make use of


967
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:10,366
this function in our increment


968
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,000
function.


969
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,416
I'll pass in true to indicate


970
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,506
that I want to scroll forwards.


971
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,446
And similarly, I can implement


972
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:24,406
accessibility decrement, the


973
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,786
only difference being that I'll


974
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:28,296
pass in false since I want to


975
00:28:28,296 --> 00:28:28,996
scroll backwards.


976
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:30,676
And that's it for the carousel


977
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:31,576
accessibility element.


978
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,276
Let's scroll back up to our


979
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:34,000
container view.


980
00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:40,006
Here, we need to expose the


981
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:41,436
carousel accessibility element,


982
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:43,156
and to do that, we can override


983
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,000
accessibility elements.


984
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:52,076
Within this function, I'll get a


985
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,286
reference to my current dog and


986
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:54,876
make sure it's valid before I go


987
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:55,996
ahead and create my elements.


988
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,576
Let's start by instantiating the


989
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:00,000
carousel accessibility element.


990
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:08,056
I'll first get a reference to


991
00:29:08,056 --> 00:29:09,106
the carousel accessibility


992
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:10,916
element if one already exists,


993
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,326
and if it doesn't, I'll


994
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:13,376
instantiate one here.


995
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,346
I'll set it's accessibility


996
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:18,086
frame to be the frame of the dog


997
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:19,726
collection view, and then I'll


998
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:20,896
store a reference to it here.


999
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:23,766
And at the end, I'll return this


1000
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:24,526
array of elements.


1001
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:28,236
Before I do that, I want to add


1002
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:29,916
some elements to my array.


1003
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:36,306
I'll check to see if my current


1004
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,706
dog has more than one image, and


1005
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,606
if so, I want my array to


1006
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:40,646
comprise of the carousel


1007
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:41,956
accessibility element, the


1008
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,356
favorite button, and the gallery


1009
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:45,066
button, but if the dog doesn't


1010
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,836
have more than one image, we


1011
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:47,926
should probably omit the gallery


1012
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:48,276
button.


1013
00:29:48,816 --> 00:29:52,836
One thing I need to remember to


1014
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:54,646
do is to update the current dog


1015
00:29:54,646 --> 00:29:55,966
property on the carousel


1016
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:58,016
accessibility element if that


1017
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,416
corresponding property gets


1018
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:02,316
updated on my container view.


1019
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:06,696
We're almost done.


1020
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,286
Recall that when I swipe to the


1021
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:11,696
carousel, the information, the


1022
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:13,386
content of the stats view is


1023
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:13,876
changing.


1024
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:15,836
However, when I'm swiping with


1025
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:17,676
VoiceOver, I need to let the


1026
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:18,986
app, I need to let VoiceOver


1027
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:19,896
know to update it's


1028
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:20,626
understanding of the


1029
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:21,826
accessibility elements on


1030
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:22,256
screen.


1031
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:24,526
To do that, I can post a layout


1032
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:25,826
change notification whenever a


1033
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:26,586
scroll occurs.


1034
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:29,496
I'll head over in my view


1035
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,736
controller file, and inside my


1036
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:33,896
scroll view did scroll view at


1037
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:35,606
the very end I'll post that


1038
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:37,066
layout change notification like


1039
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:37,436
this.


1040
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:41,566
And that's it for the carousel


1041
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:42,106
container view.


1042
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:45,986
A core part of this solution was


1043
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:47,706
using and creating accessibility


1044
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,666
elements, and I can use this


1045
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,026
same concept to help me solve a


1046
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:52,846
different problem in the stats


1047
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:53,146
view.


1048
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:55,156
Recall that in the stats view


1049
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,146
all the information was


1050
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,546
separated, and it lacked


1051
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:58,246
context.


1052
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:00,456
I can use this same concept to


1053
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:02,216
help me group the information


1054
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:03,926
for the stats view together and


1055
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:08,296
to add context.


1056
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:09,686
I'll head over to the doc stats


1057
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:10,866
view where all of these stats


1058
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:14,706
are laid out.


1059
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,236
I'll start by overriding the


1060
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:17,706
accessibility elements to create


1061
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:18,000
my elements.


1062
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,456
I want to cache the elements I


1063
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:27,756
create from this function so


1064
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:28,896
that I don't have to recompute


1065
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:30,046
them every single time I make


1066
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:30,326
them.


1067
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,126
To do that, I can create a


1068
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,206
private property called


1069
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:34,146
underscore accessibility


1070
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:35,466
elements, which will act as that


1071
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:36,906
cache and store these elements.


1072
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:39,436
Let's get into my function.


1073
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,576
First, I'll see if my cache is


1074
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:46,246
empty, and if so, I'll go ahead


1075
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:47,326
and populate my elements.


1076
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:50,156
I'll iterate over all my title


1077
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:52,116
labels, and I'll get a reference


1078
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:54,076
to the title label, which would


1079
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:56,256
be something like breed, and


1080
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:57,696
it's corresponding value, which


1081
00:31:57,856 --> 00:31:58,866
would be something like


1082
00:31:59,096 --> 00:31:59,566
Labrador.


1083
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,716
With the references to both the


1084
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:04,106
title and it's corresponding


1085
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:05,756
value, I can now create an


1086
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,136
accessibility element, which


1087
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:08,436
encompasses the information for


1088
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:09,000
both of these together.


1089
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:22,216
I'll start by creating my


1090
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:24,006
accessibility element here, and


1091
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:25,456
I'll set it's label and it's


1092
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:27,366
accessibility frame to be a


1093
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,956
combination of the corresponding


1094
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:31,066
values of both the title and the


1095
00:32:32,436 --> 00:32:32,636
value.


1096
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:34,876
I'll add this element to my


1097
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:38,066
array of elements, and once I'm


1098
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:40,126
done looping over all the title


1099
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,266
and value pairs, at the end I'll


1100
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:43,686
set my cache equal to this


1101
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,036
array, and I'll return these


1102
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:45,476
elements.


1103
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:48,486
One thing we need to remember to


1104
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:50,356
do is to reset our cache every


1105
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:51,876
time the dog object on this gets


1106
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:53,656
updated so that we can compute


1107
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:54,946
the new elements for the new


1108
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:55,236
dog.


1109
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:58,596
To do that, I can simply set it


1110
00:32:58,596 --> 00:32:59,346
to no over here.


1111
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:03,876
And that's it for the dog stats


1112
00:33:03,876 --> 00:33:04,056
view.


1113
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:06,876
Next, let's work on adding some


1114
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,426
context to the call and open


1115
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,436
location buttons.


1116
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:12,546
I'll head over to the shelter


1117
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,906
info view where I have a


1118
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,016
reference to the name of my


1119
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:18,416
shelter, the map button, and the


1120
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:18,916
call button.


1121
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,236
We'd like the actions of both of


1122
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,166
these buttons to be custom


1123
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,316
actions on their containing


1124
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,246
view, and to achieve this, we


1125
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:28,486
can start by exposing that


1126
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:29,246
containing view as an


1127
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:30,216
accessibility element.


1128
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:35,566
Let's go ahead and give this a


1129
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:36,756
descriptive label, which would


1130
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:38,000
be the name of the shelter.


1131
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:43,876
>> Finally, let's override


1132
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,436
accessibility custom actions.


1133
00:33:50,056 --> 00:33:51,296
Within this function, we'll


1134
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,536
create two custom actions, the


1135
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:55,516
map action and the call action.


1136
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,276
VoiceOver will describe these as


1137
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,936
open address in maps and call,


1138
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:01,176
but be sure to correctly


1139
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:02,066
localize these strings.


1140
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:05,856
Each of these actions will call


1141
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:07,416
a corresponding function, which


1142
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,426
activates that button.


1143
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:11,076
So, for example, map action will


1144
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:12,906
call activate map button, which


1145
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:15,426
activates the map button.


1146
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:17,266
I've conveniently defined this


1147
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:19,065

1148
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:22,346
Be sure to return to [inaudible]


1149
00:34:22,346 --> 00:34:23,766
to indicate that your method was


1150
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:24,246
successful.


1151
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:26,646
And that's it for the shelter


1152
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:26,846
view.


1153
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:30,176
Last but not least, let's work


1154
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,525
on improving the experience of


1155
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:32,025
the modal view.


1156
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:35,326
I've defined my modal view in


1157
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:37,446
dog modal view, and as Skyler


1158
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:39,065
suggested, to help VoiceOver


1159
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:40,306
recognize this as a modal view,


1160
00:34:40,886 --> 00:34:42,335
I need to override accessibility


1161
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:43,000
view as modal.


1162
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,085
We're almost done.


1163
00:34:50,206 --> 00:34:51,226
One thing to remember is that


1164
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:52,585
when I press the gallery button,


1165
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,916
we need to let the app know that


1166
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,166
the layout of the content on the


1167
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:58,016
screen has changed so VoiceOver


1168
00:34:58,016 --> 00:34:59,646
can focus to the right content.


1169
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:01,696
To do that, I can post a screen


1170
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:03,836
change notification whenever the


1171
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:04,976
gallery button gets pressed.


1172
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:07,556
I'll head over to my view


1173
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:11,426
controller file, and within my


1174
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,916
gallery button press function,


1175
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:15,576
once I animate in the modal


1176
00:35:15,576 --> 00:35:17,216
view, I'll post a screen change


1177
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:20,606
notification like this.


1178
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:23,326
And that's it.


1179
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:25,636
I already have the app prebuilt


1180
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:26,856
with all this new accessibility


1181
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,876
work, so let's take a look at


1182
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,666
what the new and improved


1183
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:30,466
experience is like.


1184
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:36,556
I'm going to turn on VoiceOver.


1185
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:39,106
>> VoiceOver on.


1186
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:40,466

00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:46,796
Swipe up or down with one finger


1191
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:47,986

>> VoiceOver tells me I can


1193
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:51,776
swipe up or down on this.


1194
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:53,336
Let's go ahead and do that to


1195
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:54,366
scroll through our carousel.


1196
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:55,596
>> Layla.


1197
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,096

the carousel accessible to me


1207
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:14,726
but so are the favorite and


1208
00:36:14,726 --> 00:36:16,226
gallery buttons from every dog


1209
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:16,856
in the carousel.


1210
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,546
I can swipe once more from left


1211
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,236
to right to skip the carousel


1212
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:22,656
and get to the stats view like


1213
00:36:22,696 --> 00:36:23,076
this.


1214
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:25,026
>> Name, Pinky.


1215
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:26,826

1216
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:27,716
to the whole carousel.


1217
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:29,376
This feels like a much better


1218
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:30,086
experience now.


1219
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:31,896

provides me with way more


1230
00:36:46,486 --> 00:36:48,816
context and navigation is faster


1231
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:50,116

1232
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:50,886

It gives me way more context.


1250

accessibility experience of our

exceptional.


1271
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:58,456
We've achieved this by shaping


1272
00:37:58,456 --> 00:37:59,836
the experience around the user


1273
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,216
and modelling the interaction


1274
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,896
around this experience, and in


1275
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:04,686
doing so, we've lifted a huge


1276
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:06,036
cognitive burden off the user.

00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:09,496
bit of effort you put towards

the accessibility of the app so


1280
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,196
they can love it as much as

anyone else.


1282
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:14,076

Hopefully Bhavya's demo


1287
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:25,756
demonstrated for you how small


1288
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,106
tweaks can transform the

00:38:28,546 --> 00:38:28,936
better.


1291
00:38:29,786 --> 00:38:30,866
It's important to note that


1292
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:32,796
creating custom interfaces for


1293
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:34,176
the accessibility of your app is


1294
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:35,836
not always the right answer.


1295
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:38,266
Sometimes the simple fix is the


1296
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,996
best fix, but what you really


1297
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:42,436
should be doing when making your


1298
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:44,716
apps accessible is thinking


1299
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:46,376
through beyond the surface level


1300
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:47,856
what it will really mean for


1301
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:49,486
someone who's using an assistive


1302
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:53,036
technology to use your app.


1303
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:54,476
To wrap this up, I'd like to


1304
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:55,556
return to where we started


1305
00:38:55,556 --> 00:38:55,916
today.


1306
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:58,676
Usable is a great first step for


1307
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:00,866
making apps accessible, but we


1308
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,106
can do better.


1309
00:39:03,326 --> 00:39:05,676
We can and we should provide our


1310
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,976
users with exceptional,


1311
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:08,706
delightful experiences that


1312
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:09,976
cater to their unique needs.


1313
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:12,926
There are a lot of ways to take


1314
00:39:12,926 --> 00:39:14,096
an accessible app from being


1315
00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:15,496
functional to being exceptional.


1316
00:39:16,836 --> 00:39:18,146
Designing for accessibility up


1317
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:20,066
front can get you a lot of wins.


1318
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:21,946
Doing things like making sure


1319
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:23,096
your colors meet minimum


1320
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:25,446
recommended contrast ratios or


1321
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,056
that your layout can adequately


1322
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:29,226
adapt to changing size have


1323
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:30,956
benefits for all users.


1324
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:33,216
But you should also extend you


1325
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:34,906
default design to accommodate


1326
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,076
the settings that users have


1327
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:36,496
enabled.


1328
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:39,116
Finally, when crafting the


1329
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:41,126
accessibility experience for


1330
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:43,206
assistive technologies, do so


1331
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,046
purposefully.


1332
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:46,126
Prioritize your content.


1333
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:47,966
Make it easy and intuitive to


1334
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:50,046
