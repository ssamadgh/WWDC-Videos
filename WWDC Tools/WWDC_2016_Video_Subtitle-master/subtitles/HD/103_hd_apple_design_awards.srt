00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:37,156
>> Hello, developers.


3
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,806
What a great venue.


4
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:40,436
This is really great.


5
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:41,956
Thanks for coming today.


6
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:45,236
It's been a long day, but we've
got some really great stuff


7
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:45,636
for you.


8
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:47,266
So I want to welcome you


9
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:50,896
to the 15th Apple
Design Award Ceremony.


10
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:54,266
And we've got a ton of
great winners this evening.


11
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:58,146
And we'd like to, of course,
recognize their great work.


12
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:02,136
The Apple Design Awards are all
about recognizing great work


13
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:03,636
by people in this community.


14
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:08,556
And this is the moment when many
of you -- well, many of you --


15
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,716
some of you get to take home one


16
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:12,196
of the Apple Design
Award Trophies,


17
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,536
which everyone wants one.


18
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:18,596
And so we'll see who
gets one tonight.


19
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,026
But to start things off, I
just want to set a little bit


20
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:25,086
of context for the apps that
are going to win tonight.


21
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:29,386
The App Store opened
eight years ago.


22
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:32,636
In fact, next month it'll
be exactly eight years old.


23
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,126
And it was on July 10th of 2008.


24
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:39,556
And in those eight
years, apps took off.


25
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,496
Right? They've taken off.


26
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:43,126
And today, we heard 2
million apps on the App Store.


27
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:45,556
But if we just go
back for a moment


28
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,736
to those first days,
it was pretty crazy.


29
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,366
I mean, it all started off
with the iPhone, right?


30
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,496
And we all remember
the first TV ads.


31
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,706
They were 30-second slots.


32
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:59,636
And in those 30-second
slots, you had five


33
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,316
or six apps that were featured.


34
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:05,436
And so each app had five
seconds to audition with you,


35
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:07,766
the customer -- with
you, the audience.


36
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,446
And to make an impression


37
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,556
in five seconds is
a pretty big deal.


38
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:18,016
But what happened in those ads
was people would watch the ads


39
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,286
and they would stop
everything that they were doing


40
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:22,626
and they would pay attention to
the app that was being shown.


41
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:23,866
And within five seconds,


42
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,746
they would have decided
whether it mattered to them


43
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,816
and if they were going to go
and download it or buy it.


44
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,266
And I think that's
pretty impressive.


45
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,826
And those apps -- basically, it
was those TV ads and those apps


46
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:38,356
that created the phrase,
"There's an app for that."


47
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,796
And that phrase was born.


48
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:43,086
And it was during
that time way early


49
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:45,286
on that we saw enormous
creativity.


50
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,646
I mean, we didn't have
this thing before.


51
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:48,476
iPhone was out.


52
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:49,946
We had this SDK.


53
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:51,106
We didn't have that before.


54
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:52,856
And we saw enormous creativity.


55
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,996
We saw great games,
really useful


56
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:57,806
and very valuable utilities,


57
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,536
some pretty incredible
augmented reality,


58
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:03,086
and lots of other great stuff,


59
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:05,056
much of which was
really groundbreaking.


60
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:11,166
And then, two years later,
the iPad was introduced.


61
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,376
And it was introduced
not far from here


62
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,486
at the Yerba Buena
Center of the Arts.


63
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,936
And I remember that day.


64
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,656
It was an incredible day.


65
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:22,106
But when the iPad
arrived in 2010,


66
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,606
it brought a whole
new wave of apps.


67
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:28,376
And these were apps that
stopped us in our tracks.


68
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:32,186
I mean these were apps that,
when we first saw them,


69
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:35,186
they caused us to
pause and to be amazed


70
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:36,846
at what could be
done on this device.


71
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,816
And then we had universal
apps coming


72
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,576
and bringing functionality
from iPad back to iPhone,


73
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,816
and the experience of all
of the apps got better.


74
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:50,646
And all of these apps early on
changed the way that we taught.


75
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,936
They changed the way that
people learned with iPad.


76
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:57,166
They changed the way that we
shared, that we connected,


77
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,556
that we worked, and that
we spent our day getting


78
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:01,536
things done.


79
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,336
These were transformational
apps.


80
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,286
And then more recently,


81
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:10,436
Apple Watch was introduced,
and Apple TV.


82
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,526
And with each of these, we
saw a new wave of apps coming.


83
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:17,266
And so now, as you've
heard several times today,


84
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:20,016
we've got four platforms
for you.


85
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:21,896
And this is amazing.


86
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,836
I mean, for me, being
at Apple 16 years,


87
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,496
I remember when it
was just the Mac


88
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:29,246
and there was some
great work going on.


89
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:34,776
And then everything took
off, and now the Mac is part


90
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,416
of that whole ecosystem.


91
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,046
And there's a tremendous
opportunity for you


92
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,746
with these four platforms.


93
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:43,776
And we're starting to see
some really great work


94
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:46,036
from developers on
these four platforms,


95
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:48,556
and a few of those will
be honored here tonight.


96
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,156
Now, tonight's winners
have created apps that are,


97
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,216
once again, that set a
benchmark for excellence.


98
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:01,726
And they set a benchmark
for excellence in usability,


99
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:11,586
excellence in design, excellent
innovation, and excellence


100
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:12,846
in technology adoption.


101
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:16,286
And if you've been part of
the Apple Design Awards before


102
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:18,036
or ever heard me speak, you know


103
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,816
that that's not all
there is to a great app.


104
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:24,006
There's even more that we
look for in winning apps.


105
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:27,086
We're always looking for
whether the app is compelling


106
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:29,176
and leaves a great
first impression.


107
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:32,476
We're always looking for
whether an app is engaging,


108
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:35,646
meaning it draws you
in and keeps you there,


109
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:38,096
and then gets you coming
back again and again.


110
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,166
That's a big challenge for apps.


111
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,576
We look for apps that are
enabling, that allow you


112
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,866
to do things you
could never do before.


113
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,046
We're looking for
state-of-the-art apps of course.


114
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:51,126
We're looking for
accessible apps.


115
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,976
We're looking for
localized apps.


116
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:55,606
Because accessible and
localized apps mean


117
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,326
that those apps are available
to an even wider audience


118
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:02,026
than they were prior to being
accessible and localized.


119
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:04,556
And so there's a lot
of stuff that we look


120
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:07,696
for in winning apps, and these
are just some of the things


121
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:09,226
that we watch for
in winning apps.


122
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:11,346
So let's get started.


123
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:15,036
Let's start with apps that
were written by students.


124
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:21,526
So you've heard today that we
had 350 scholarship winners this


125
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,886
year at WWDC, which
is a record number.


126
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:27,296
And these folks, these
students, had to submit an app.


127
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,226
As part of the scholarship
process,


128
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:32,506
they had to submit an app that
was either written explicitly


129
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:35,156
for the scholarship
selection process,


130
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:37,066
or they could just
tell us about an app


131
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:38,916
that they had already
developed and put on --


132
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,036
that was already
on the App Store.


133
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,576
And we looked through
all these apps


134
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,436
and we found some
pretty cool stuff.


135
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,906
So tonight we want to
award two student winners.


136
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:52,966
And the first is Linum by
Joaquin Vila from Mexico.


137
00:06:53,516 --> 00:07:11,896
[ Applause ]


138
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:12,736
>> Thanks so much.


139
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:13,316
>> You're welcome.


140
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:20,846
[ Music ]


141
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:25,526
All right, so Joaquin
started developing this app


142
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:29,106
after he had applied for a
job at a local game developer,


143
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:30,426
and that hadn't worked out.


144
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,976
And he decided after
that that, like,


145
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,676
he could just do
this on his own.


146
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,536
He didn't need to work
for no other developer.


147
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:41,846
So he decided to write his own
app, get it on the App Store.


148
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:45,556
And I'd like to show
you this app.


149
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:47,546
And before I do, I just wanted


150
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:52,036
to say Joaquin was a 2015
Scholarship Winner last year


151
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,746
at WWDC, so probably
learned a lot


152
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:56,646
about what you used
in the app last year.


153
00:07:56,646 --> 00:08:00,726
And he's also super active in
the local developer community


154
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:02,146
in many of the meetups
in his hometown.


155
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:07,156
All right, so I'm just going to
show you this on this screen.


156
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:09,616
So what you're seeing here
is Linum is a puzzle game


157
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:12,036
where the goal is
to complete levels


158
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:13,606
in the fewest moves possible.


159
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:17,566
And what you're trying to do is
take these line nodes and lines


160
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:21,086
and pivot them around to connect
with nodes to solve the puzzles.


161
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:23,396
And as the number
of nodes increases,


162
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:26,246
complex puzzles challenge
even the best players.


163
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:30,346
And the beauty of Linum
is its simplicity.


164
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:33,035
It's got a clean UI and
a simple set of rules.


165
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:35,736
And with a smart
implementation of touch


166
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,986
and approachable
progression system,


167
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:41,966
terrific overall presentation
and use of Apple technologies,


168
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,816
Linum is without doubt an
Apple Design Award Winner


169
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,306
for a student.


170
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:46,926

All right.


173
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,136
And our second student
winner tonight is Dividr


174
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:04,976
by Josh Deichmann, Patrick

[ Music ]


178
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,556
So I guess just one of
you are here today, yeah?


179
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:23,186
>> Yeah.


180
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,536
>> No problem.


181
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,146
There's three guys.


182
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:29,746
So all three of these guys, one
of whom is here, are students


183
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,706
at the Rochester
Institute of Technology


184
00:09:31,706 --> 00:09:32,936
in Northern New York State.


185
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:37,676
And at RIT, they went to an iOS
development challenge earlier


186
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:38,146
this year.


187
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:39,106
And it was at that event


188
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:41,906
that they started
working on this game.


189
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:43,656
And Josh is the programmer.


190
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:44,226
Is it Josh?


191
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:44,516
>> Yeah.


192
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,656
>> Yeah, Josh is the programmer.


193
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,276
Patrick is the designer.


194
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:50,946
And Erik is the guy who created
the soundtrack for the game


195
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,826
but also kind of kept you
guys on track, you know,


196
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,126
in terms of development.


197
00:09:55,356 --> 00:10:00,166
So let me just show you
this game for a minute.


198
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:05,516
So Dividr is this fun and
addicting 2D arcade game.


199
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:09,046
And it makes use of 3D
touch of variant pressure


200
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:13,856
to move the control
squares in and out depending


201
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,606
on the pressure that
you apply to the screen.


202
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:18,086
So the more pressure you
apply, the further out they go.


203
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,316
The lighter on you are,
the closer in they go.


204
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:24,546
And you're basically avoiding
these obstacles on screen.


205
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:27,696
It's simple and compelling,
written entirely


206
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:29,856
in Swift, supports Game Center.


207
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,926
And it was, without a
doubt, a great choice


208
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,846
for an Apple Design
Award this evening.


209
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:35,976

So those are our 2 winning
apps developed by students.


215
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:50,646
Pretty great stuff.


216
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:51,476
And there were lots more.


217
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:52,916
But, you know, we've got
to draw the line somewhere.


218
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:53,926
Not everybody can win.


219
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:58,866
All right, now let's move on
to your main winners tonight.


220
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:03,386
We have 10 winners this
year, and 10 winners


221
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,176
which are all super compelling.


222
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:08,336
They're all incredibly
well-designed.


223
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:12,306
They're all super
state-of-the-art.


224
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:15,396
And they're all optimized
for the devices


225
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,386
that they were created
for and for the use cases


226
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:20,066
that customers will
face with them.


227
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:23,236
And so let's begin.


228
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:24,846
The first Apple Design
Award Winner


229
00:11:24,846 --> 00:11:28,936
for 2016 is Frame.io
by Frame.io, Inc.


230
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:29,916
from New York City.

[ Music ]


233
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:50,476
Congratulations.


234
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,996
Great job, guys.


235
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:55,636
Great to meet you.


236
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:01,746
[ Music ]


237
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:05,736
All right, so Frame.io is a
video collaboration platform


238
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:08,126
for teens working
together on film or video.


239
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:12,886
And it lets these teens easily
share files, give feedback,


240
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:17,336
review clips, approve media,
and do a whole ton of stuff


241
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,296
in that creative pro workflow.


242
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:23,706
And it turns out that it's
really hard to do this right.


243
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:28,116
And Frame.io nails it
by filling a big gap


244
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:32,036
in the creator pro workflow by
solving this complicated task.


245
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:35,186
And to give you a better
idea of how this app works,


246
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,526
I'd like to ask Michael
to demo it to us now.


247
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:38,746
>> Thank you, John.


248
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:42,296
So this is a typical
project in Frame.io.


249
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:45,496
Now it's really media-centric,
so you can see all the media


250
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,576
in the lower half of the view.


251
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:48,726
Now -- whoops.


252
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:54,296
So basically what they've
done here is they've made a


253
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:57,626
UICollectionViewFlowLayout
with UIKit dynamics,


254
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,386
and that really makes
this view come alive.


255
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:03,816
Now at the top, you can see
all the project participants.


256
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,086
Now this is a really fun
and interactive animation.


257
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,286
And that's really cool,
and I can do it slow.


258
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:10,716
There we go.


259
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:12,696
And that's using core animation


260
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:14,076
with custom curves
and key frames.


261
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,006
That opens up to a table
list view where I can swipe


262
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:20,726
to remove someone from a project
or leave the project myself.


263
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:25,556
Now the media player is
really key to Frame.io.


264
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,696
And so what they've done here
is they've implemented 3D touch,


265
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,956
and they've done this in a
number of different ways.


266
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:33,126
The first one is a feature
they call Touch Scrub.


267
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:37,986
So on this clip of this mountain
-- all I'm going to do is scrub


268
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:40,046
across this clip very lightly.


269
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:41,176
And you can see I
get an overview


270
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:42,536
of the clip really quickly.


271
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:45,036
Now the other thing that they've
done is they've gone deeper


272
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:46,246
and implemented peak and pop.


273
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:48,636
So on this clip, I'm
going to push gently.


274
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:49,486
That peaks in.


275
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:50,896
And now watch this.


276
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,766
When I pop, it goes
to the same frame


277
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,546
into a new view --
the Comment View.


278
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,556
Pretty cool stuff.


279
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,236
Now the Comment View is


280
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,666
where all the project
participants come in


281
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,786
and actually collaborate.


282
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:04,976
All these comments
are time-synchronized.


283
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,956
So when I touch something,
it actually goes to the frame


284
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:08,956
where the comment was made.


285
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:12,326
You'll also notice that all
the commenter's pictures turn


286
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:13,026
to a Play button.


287
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:15,556
So for example, here you
can see that Play button.


288
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,696
If I touch the Play
button, it's a feature


289
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,316
that they call Comment Replay


290
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,536
where it will start
playing two seconds before


291
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:23,766
and two seconds after.


292
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:28,016
And then where the comment
is, the comment flashes


293
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:29,216
and the phone will vibrate.


294
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:29,976
One more time.


295
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,386
And here's the comment.


296
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:32,986
That's where it is.


297
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:38,136
So I'm going to let this video
play out just a little bit


298
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,886
because I know that there's
something wrong in here --


299
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:43,146
and there's a lion
in my surf video.


300
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,356
You know, like, really?


301
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:50,226
So I'm going to put my
comment in, but I'm also going


302
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:53,636
to go ahead and annotate
and send that comment along.


303
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:58,496
So this app is incredible.


304
00:14:58,576 --> 00:14:59,986
It's written entirely in Swift.


305
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,466
It's using the latest tools.


306
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:04,006
It's using multiple storyboards,
storyboard references,


307
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,646
auto layout, size classes.


308
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,186
Did I mention it
was done in Swift?


309
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:10,776
Did I mention that this
is their first iOS app?


310
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,856
This is a really great app.


311
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:12,986

with a twist that's
based on color.


345
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:04,566
And it has a really
stunning visual presentation


346
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,776
which we'd like to show you now.


347
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,026
My colleague, Mark,
is joining us.


348
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:10,925
He's going to play while I
tell you about this game.


349
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,846
So the objective of
Chameleon Run is to make it


350
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,726
through the level in
the best possible time.


351
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:18,276
And Mark is jumping from
platform to platform.


352
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:21,616
But if you notice, when he lands
on a platform, sometimes he has


353
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,286
to switch the character's color


354
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,636
to match the platform
he's landing on.


355
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:28,566
And that becomes
very challenging


356
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,696
as you make your way
through this game.


357
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:33,226
OK, so that was a
very easy level.


358
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:34,896
Let's do it one more time
because I want to point


359
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,916
out a couple more
things on this level,


360
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,226
especially the rendering
effects.


361
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,306
That was something that we
really loved about this game.


362
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:45,176
If you take a look at the
depth of field with the objects


363
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:48,516
in the background, the
shock waves coming off


364
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,016
of the character, and
also the smoke trails


365
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:52,726
and just the particle effect.


366
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:55,706
We thought that all of that
really added something visually


367
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:56,606
to this game.


368
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:58,686
But, OK, so we did
very well there.


369
00:17:58,686 --> 00:17:59,846
That was an easy level.


370
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,856
And now Mark is going to go


371
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:04,006
for something much,
much more difficult.


372
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,126
Go all the way.


373
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,616
All right, here we go.


374
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:09,146
Level 15, The End is Near.


375
00:18:09,886 --> 00:18:13,016
And let me tell you a little bit
about why we chose this game.


376
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:17,156
So first of all, as I said,
we love the visual style


377
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:20,426
and just the vibrancy of
the colors in this game.


378
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:24,716
And it was so clear that so
much care and iteration went


379
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,166
into the construction
of the levels


380
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,156
and just fine-tuning
this content.


381
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:33,296
Then the second thing --
Mark is doing very well.


382
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:33,666
All right.


383
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:34,256
Nice.


384
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:41,136
[ Applause ]


385
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:42,566
Do it again.


386
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:42,936
Go for it.


387
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:48,486
So the second thing
is the replayability.


388
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:54,756
Yeah, OK, that's me playing
now -- most of the time.


389
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:57,576
So the replayability in this
game is just phenomenal.


390
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:00,346
Most of these levels have
in effect a high road


391
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:01,636
and a low road that
you can take.


392
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,116
You sort of can go up and down


393
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:05,666
as you're progressing
through the level.


394
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:09,366
But the game really
encourages you to go back


395
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:11,716
and play the levels
over and over again.


396
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,046
Maybe the first time through
you're going for time.


397
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,846
But then it unlocks
different objectives


398
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:20,846
to collect all the crystals or
to go entirely through the level


399
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:24,106
without switching your color,
which imagine how difficult


400
00:19:24,106 --> 00:19:26,576
that would be on a level
like the one we just saw.


401
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:30,636
And the third thing about this
game is that this is a game


402
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,346
that is great on
your iPhone and iPad,


403
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:35,446
but it is awesome
on your Apple TV.


404
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:38,196
We love how this plays
with the Siri Remote.


405
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:39,686
That's what Mark is using now.


406
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,416
It also plays great
with an MFi controller.


407
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:45,776
And it's just one of these
games that is just fantastic


408
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:49,576
when you see it on the big
screen in your living room.


409
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,126
So that's Chameleon Run.


410
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,466
It supports Game Center.


411
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:55,856
It's localized in 8 languages,
and it's a premium title.

is Auxy Music Creation


421

[ Music ]


424
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:44,216
Auxy Music Creation is an
audio creation app for iPad.


425
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,086
And the Auxy team realized


426
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:49,376
that electronic music was going
mainstream, and so they sat down


427
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:53,056
and started to develop this app
that allowed electronic fans


428
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,966
to create some of their own
tracks on an iOS device.


429
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,586
And this is a super
compelling app


430
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:02,216
with a clean minimalist style.


431
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:07,696
And honestly inside of this
app, it's almost impossible


432
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:10,086
to create something that
doesn't sound great.


433
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,996
No matter what you tap
on, you get great results.


434
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:17,226
So I'd like to ask Michael
again to show us this app.


435
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:18,666
>> Great. Thank you, John.


436
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,606
So the first thing
that we really loved


437
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:24,046
about Auxy was the really subtle
and unobtrusive onboarding.


438
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:25,936
Now I'm not locked
out from the app.


439
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,996
I can go anywhere I want,
but we'll follow the trail


440
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:28,846
and see where it leads us.


441
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:31,176
So I'll double-tap to start
creating my first loops


442
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,856
and drums.


443
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:36,436
I'll start with some bass drum.


444
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,786
That's great.


445
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:40,516
So now it told me that
I can move some notes


446
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:43,056
around by dragging,
which is really handy


447
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:45,256
because I just missed that one.


448
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:48,556
So we'll do some high hat.


449
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:52,396
And notice how quick and
how performant the UI is.


450
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,046
It's really cool.


451
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:56,576
OK, I'm going to add some
tom-toms on the off beats.


452
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,646
That actually sounds more like
a kettle drum than a tom-tom,


453
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:04,426
and that's great because the
onboarding is telling me how


454
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:05,176
to change my kit.


455
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:06,906
So let's see if I can find
something a little hipper.


456
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,856
Not that. Not that.


457
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,776
70's disco -- that's
what I'm looking for.


458
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:16,626
OK. So now what do we
need for 70's disco?


459
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,006
We need some disco base, right?


460
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:23,346
So let's add another loop.


461
00:22:23,346 --> 00:22:28,546
Great. So the UI is really
responsive because they built


462
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:31,056
on top of UIKit, and that
is built on top of Metal.


463
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:32,676
They also went ahead


464
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:34,646
and implemented Grand
Central Dispatch.


465
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:35,796

with the performance.

one more loop here.

have a lot of character.

00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,856
All right, our fourth
winner is an app


516
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:01,266
that helps you to
form good habits.


517
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:04,226
Congratulations to Streaks


518
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:06,626
by Zervaas Enterprises
from Australia.

[ Applause ]


520
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:20,896
[ Music ]


521
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:21,646
Good job.


522
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:21,826
>> Thank you.


523
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:21,893
>> Yeah.


524
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:31,546
[ Music ]


525
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,956
So, Streaks is a to-do list


526
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:36,716
that helps you form good
habits and change behavior.


527
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:40,046
And Streaks has a simple
and straightforward UI,


528
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:43,456
and it's got an excellent
implementation on Apple Watch --


529
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:47,656
probably the best Apple
Watch app available today.


530
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:50,096
And we'd like to show
you Streaks right now.


531
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:50,966
TC?


532
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,396
>> Thanks, John.


533
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:56,176
So trying to form good
habits is difficult.


534
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,506
The last thing you want is
an app that is complicated


535
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:01,996
to set up, uninspiring to use,


536
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:05,686
and pretty much itself a
reason for procrastination.


537
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:10,766
So here are five of
the possible six tasks


538
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:11,886
that I've set up for myself.


539
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:15,026
And you can see on the top
right "Practice cello".


540
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:18,476
So I miss playing the
cello professionally,


541
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,606
but I just haven't
been practicing.


542
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:25,526
I'm using Streaks to help get me
back to it, to help me remember


543
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:29,116
to practice regularly because
I have a concert coming up.


544
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:30,976
And I've been saying
that for a few years now.


545
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:33,071
[ Laughter ]


546
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:39,016
So to see how I've been doing,
I can just tap on the Task icon


547
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,906
for the calendar view here.


548
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,376
I can also peak and pop onto it.


549
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:45,676
And you can see June
was pretty good.


550
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:50,136
But if I was to reveal to
you May -- not so good.


551
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:52,876
So the crosses is where,
for whatever reason,


552
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:54,256
I've decided not to practice.


553
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:56,936
Coming back here
and tapping again,


554
00:26:56,936 --> 00:26:59,486
this is a summary
of how I've done.


555
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:01,526
And you can see that
I'm currently


556
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:03,416
on a streak of 15 days.


557
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:06,176
Now we're back here.


558
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:09,956
To mark a task complete,
all I do is to tap and hold.


559
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:11,066
And there you go.


560
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:13,046
It's like I've just finished
practicing for today.


561
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:15,326
Now when I was outside earlier,


562
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:21,336
I was reading the iOS 10
API disk documentation.


563
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,486
So I'm going to go and check


564
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:25,486
"Read the book" as
complete as well.


565
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:28,966
Now Streaks is also
on Apple Watch.


566
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:32,546
And it has Watch complications
right onto your Watch face,


567
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:35,226
including one that is
really cleverly designed.


568
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:38,756
It's based on a dotted
design which looks just


569
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:42,366
like the iPhone app so that
you can tell from just looking


570
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:43,636
at how the dots are arranged


571
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:46,106
and which ones are
lit how you're doing


572
00:27:46,106 --> 00:27:47,606
with your task for that day.


573
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:53,426
Streaks uses Watch connectivity
extensively, so my Apple Watch


574
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:55,276
and iPhone are always in sync.


575
00:27:55,276 --> 00:28:01,756
Now Streaks is also considerate,
and I'll show you what I mean,


576
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:05,316
especially in the way it
handles notifications.


577
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:13,096
For instance, when it comes
to automatic time and my cat,


578
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:17,766
Auzuki, Streaks knows that
I play with her every day


579
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,416
when I come home from
work immediately,


580
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,036
otherwise she gets quite cranky.


581
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,916
And nobody wants a cranky cat.


582
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:27,966
So it knows to remind me
at the same time each day


583
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:31,116
but 30 minutes in advance of
that so that I can continue


584
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:32,716
that streak and have
a happy cat.


585
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:33,536
All right?


586
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:37,596
And it also looks at
HealthKit to try and figure


587
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,866
out when it is I
typically go to bed


588
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:44,476
so that it doesn't send me a
reminder too late into my day.


589
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:48,076
For when things are
going really well,


590
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:50,176
you get encouragement as well.


591
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:53,846
And in addition to that, Streaks
will suggest perhaps a higher


592
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:56,706
goal so that you achieve
an overall greater result.


593
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,926
Now, conversely, if you've
been missing a few tasks,


594
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:02,886
it will suggest an
easier-to-achieve goal


595
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:03,976
so you don't end up giving up.


596
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:14,026
OK, so Streaks is
a 5-star rated app.


597
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:16,346
It's exclusive to iOS and Watch,


598
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:19,266
and it was developed
using Swift.


599
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:22,896
Bad habits form automatically.


600
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:25,766
Streaks helps us come
up with good ones.


601
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,496
I'm more confident than ever


602
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:29,926
that I'll be playing my
cello soon in a concert,


603
00:29:29,926 --> 00:29:33,196
or to read many books, and
have a really happy cat.


604
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:34,416
Thank you.

>> So that's Streaks.


607
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:44,226
We picked this app as a
winner for its simplicity,


608
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:48,156
the great visual design, and
the excellent implementation


609
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:48,866
on Apple Watch.


610
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:53,056
They're localized into 25
languages and they're exclusive


611
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:57,146
to iPhone, Apple Watch, and
Apple TV as TC just mentioned.


612
00:29:57,886 --> 00:30:01,946
All right, our next
winner is, again, a game.


613
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:06,156
Lara Croft by Square Enix.

[ Music ]


616
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,126
So Lara Croft Go
captures the spirit


617
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:37,296
of this classic franchise,
and then reimagines it


618
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:42,406
into this classy new app with an
innovative new look and turns it


619
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:43,696
into this great adventure game.


620
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:48,276
This is a great example of
a large developer working


621
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:50,876
with a small studio
within their organization


622
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:52,346
to give them the task


623
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:55,476
of creating something
that's really well-executed


624
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:56,926
down to the smallest detail.


625
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:59,066
These guys have done
a tremendous job


626
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,236
with this huge franchise.


627
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:03,066
These folks are based
out of Montreal, Canada.


628
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:06,786
Right? And it's great --
you've done a tremendous job.


629
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:08,536
Now to show you this game,


630
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,066
I'd like to ask Allan
to give a demo.


631
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:12,526
>> Great. Thank you, John.


632
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:17,336
So Lara Croft Go is a turn-based
puzzle adventure game that's set


633
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:20,486
in the ruins of an
ancient civilization.


634
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:24,246
And what we loved about this
game is how it took so many


635
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:26,786
of the elements of the
Lara Croft franchise --


636
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:31,316
things like the archeological
exploration, and the adventure,


637
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:35,186
and solving puzzles and avoiding
traps, and Lara herself --


638
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,196
and reimagined all those things


639
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:41,706
into a puzzle game
that's perfect for mobile


640
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:44,146
and beautifully designed
for touch.


641
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:45,866
So I'd like to show you it here.


642
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,326
I'm coming into a level
here that's onboarding me


643
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,016
into a new game mechanic
that has to do


644
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:52,566
with these rolling boulders.


645
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:54,516
But actually, before
I even do that,


646
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:56,556
just take this in for a moment.


647
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:59,906
I mean, check out the
stylized rendering.


648
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:02,506
I hope you can all hear the
ambient soundtrack here.


649
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,656
It's just beautiful.


650
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:07,076
And we really love
things like the attention


651
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:08,596
to detail in the levels.


652
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:11,406
And it has a really
unobtrusive UI.


653
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:16,046
There's no virtual joypad
here to move Lara around.


654
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:20,106
To move Lara to the next space,
I just swipe and she moves.


655
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:22,976
But, OK, so let's start
looking through this level here.


656
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,256
Obviously there's this
boulder, and I have a feeling


657
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,556
that if I step on
the trap -- yeah.


658
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:31,936
OK. So, mental note, don't
step under falling boulders.


659
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:35,696
But we can put that knowledge
to work a little bit later.


660
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:38,796
Isn't it cool how she kind
of hangs off the ledge there?


661
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:40,866
All right, but I'm going
forward a little further here.


662
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:41,696
Here's another one.


663
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:45,496
I'm going to get it going,
but then I'll take a step back


664
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,696
and let it roll past me.


665
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,656
OK, so I'm safe.


666
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:51,796
And I come down now into
the next part of the stage.


667
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,096
All right.


668
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:55,636
So now in this part, I'm
going to pick up the spear.


669
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:56,806
But I'm not going
to use that yet.


670
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:59,466
What I'm going to do --
this lizard has woken up


671
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:02,666
and I'm going to step back
and let him step on the trap.


672
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:05,606
Bam! OK, no more lizard.


673
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:07,376
So now let's go forward.


674
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:09,996
And this next one wakes up.


675
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,506
OK, now the game mechanic here
is that as I move once space,


676
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:14,986
the lizard will move one space.


677
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:18,696
And it'll follow me through
whatever path I take.


678
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:20,676
So I'm going to climb
up the wall here


679
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:24,996
and go a particular way to get
him right where I want him.


680
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:29,106
Bam! It never gets old.


681
00:33:29,246 --> 00:33:30,526
All right.


682
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,606
And I'm going to
dispatch the snake.


683
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:35,166
Great. And that finishes


684
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,926
out this particular
stage of this level.


685
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,016
And, really, this is just
a taste of this game.


686
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:44,596
There's over a hundred
of these different scenes


687
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:46,606
with incredible detail.


688
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,876
And it's just hats off to
you guys for this creation.


689
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:50,926
It's really beautiful.


690
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:53,896
The game supports
Game Center and iCloud


691
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:56,626
to synchronize its progress
across all of your devices.


692
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:59,786
It's localized in 11
different languages.


693
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:03,966
And it's a premium title with
a couple of in-app purchases --


694
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:07,866
one to provide you solutions
to puzzles if you get stuck,


695
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:10,166
and the other to
customize the character.


696
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,085
So, again, hats off to you guys.


697
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:12,876
Congratulations.

than 5,000 5-star
ratings on the App Store.


702
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:26,466
Tremendous work.


703

All right, our next winner is
3D4Medical Complete Anatomy


704
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:32,835
from Ireland.

706
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:48,416
Congrats.

[ Music ]


710
00:34:56,576 --> 00:35:00,076
This is a groundbreaking
3D anatomical platform


711
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:02,906
for medical students,
medical professionals,


712
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,206
and lifelong learners.


713
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:09,156
And we love this app for how
it's disrupting traditional ways


714
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:10,136
of teaching anatomy.


715
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,026
For example, medical
professionals will use this app


716
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:16,446
as a tool to help patients
understand what's going


717
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:19,206
on with an injury or
an upcoming procedure.


718
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:24,536
And that understanding actually
helps people heal better


719
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:25,296
and more quickly.


720
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:28,006
And I'd like to ask
my colleague, Chris,


721
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:28,976
to show this to you now.


722
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:32,726
>> This was an app that
completely blew us away


723
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:35,886
with its attention to detail,
graphics and animations,


724
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,626
and most importantly what
it allowed users to do.


725
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:40,266
We love the iconography
throughout that.


726
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:41,806
Check out along the bottom menu.


727
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:43,656
The icons are consistent


728
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:45,606
and representative
of what they control.


729
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,306
I'm going to turn
some of these layers


730
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,806
on so you can get an
idea of what's in here.


731
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:53,516
The app has over 6,200
structures, so it's deep


732
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:54,726
without being overwhelming.


733
00:35:55,316 --> 00:35:58,136
The content is progressively
displayed as you need it.


734
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,106
Just a tremendous
amount of content.


735
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:03,216
But I'm going to turn
these layers off for now


736
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:03,976
and move into the bone.


737
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,216
Notice the incredible
shading and textures.


738
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,946
They're the result of
high-resolution scans


739
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:15,286
and artist interpretations.


740
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:19,506
The team has a skeleton on
staff named Hank, a cadaver,


741
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:21,316
and a medical team
that they reference


742
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:22,336
to get things just right.


743
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:25,096
We love it when a team
goes that extra mile


744
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:26,736
to make things particularly
beautiful.


745
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:30,596
If at any point in the app
you see something that's


746
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:32,616
interesting, you can just tap
on it to learn a bit more.


747
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:35,476
Are there any Warriors
fans in the audience?


748
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:38,176
[ Cheering ]


749
00:36:38,336 --> 00:36:40,566
This is the ligament that nearly
cost the Warriors their season


750
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,256
when Steph went out with that
knee injury a couple weeks back.


751
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:45,826
Now I'm going to
turn on some muscle


752
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:46,966
so we can see some movement.


753
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:53,116
I can select on a muscle group
and I can see how that works.


754
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:59,336
I can adjust this
motion in real time,


755
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:01,986
rotate, and see things in 3D.


756
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,316
One of the reasons
we chose this app is


757
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,806
because it leveraged the
performance of iPad Pro.


758
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:09,326
With the new CPU and GPU,


759
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:12,186
it allowed double the graphics
resolution of previous versions.


760
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:14,326
Again, check out the
texture on that muscle.


761
00:37:14,326 --> 00:37:16,946
Just incredibly realistic.


762
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:20,256
Now we could spend hours just
exploring content in this app,


763
00:37:20,316 --> 00:37:22,266
but 3D4Medical wanted
to allow users


764
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:24,126
to create and share content.


765
00:37:24,606 --> 00:37:26,396
So at any point in the
app, I can start recording.


766
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:27,266
So I'm going to do that now.


767
00:37:27,886 --> 00:37:30,406
So I'm now recording audio
and what's on the screen.


768
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:33,946
I can use this --
if I was a teacher,


769
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:35,306
I could create a
lesson for a student.


770
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:38,906
Or if I was a physician, I
could record a common procedure


771
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,106
to share with my patients.


772
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:44,336
For the baseball fans, what I'm
doing here is I'm using Apple


773
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:47,256
Pencil to pull back the
layers of the muscle


774
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,296
to show the ligaments that
were repaired during Tommy


775
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:51,186
John's surgery.


776
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:53,686
Imagine a physician
sharing something like this


777
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:55,896
with a patient before
a procedure.


778
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:59,206
I can then save the
recording for my own use.


779
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:02,126
Or if I choose, I can share it
with the 3D4Medical Community.


780
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:05,166
We love it when a developer
tackles a unique problem


781
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,226
in a new way.


782
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:07,936
This is a team that
looked at human anatomy


783
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:09,526
and what they could do with iPad


784
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:11,706
and created a world-class
education tool.


785
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,356
Congratulations, guys.

00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:27,576
its high-fidelity models,
the attention to detail,

801
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:12,436
>> So INKS is from the makers
of Lumino City based in the UK.


802
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:15,896
And after extensive research at
their local pub, they decided


803
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,876
to create a new generation
of pinball.


804
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:20,786
And if you think about it, INKS.


805
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:23,626
is sort of a cross between
paintball and pinball


806
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:24,876
with an artistic flare.


807
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,816
And you've got to see this.


808
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:30,626
So for the demo, I
decided I'd ask Mike,


809
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:37,276
the evangelism resident pinball
expert, to show this to you now.


810
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:39,496
>> Thanks, John.


811
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:41,336
So right from the
Welcome Screen,


812
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:45,046
you get to enjoy the
beautifully stunning


813
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:46,646
and highly realistic INKS.


814
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:51,196
The way they blend together the
colors here are really gorgeous.


815
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:53,016
Now as I hit the
pinball through,


816
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,296
you can see how it traces
those colors one into the other


817
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:58,076
and draws it onto the paper.


818
00:39:58,256 --> 00:39:59,866
It's really pretty awesome.


819
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,326
All right, let's play a game.


820
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:03,956
Now INKS features
five different levels,


821
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:07,976
each of which has 24 different
boards, each with its own set


822
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:10,966
of obstacles, challenges,
and increasing complexity.


823
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:13,736
As John said, I'm kind
of a pinball wizard.


824
00:40:13,896 --> 00:40:15,646
So I'll start with one of
the more advanced ones,


825
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:17,606
but not so advanced
that you guys feel bad


826
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:18,616
about your pinball skills.

Now check out each
of these boards.


828
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:26,066
They're each custom designed,
obviously handcrafted


829
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,936
with a lot of thought and care.


830
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:30,076
They're their own

00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:32,406
on their own before
you even start to play.


832
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,736
And check out the gold, and
silver, and bronze pinballs.


833
00:40:36,026 --> 00:40:38,746
These show you how well you've
done in each of these levels.

00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:40,706
Now bronze is not good enough,


835
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:42,836

841
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:05,436
Oh, man. OK, this was a
lot easier in rehearsals


842
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:07,506
when I didn't have
5,000 people watching.


843
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:11,726

to one of the easier levels.

845
00:41:14,116 --> 00:41:19,356
And just to show you guys
this, too, INKS offers hours


846
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:23,966
of gameplay for more beginner
players -- of which I am not.


847
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:27,266
All right, let's try this.


848
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:30,666
Bam! That's how I do!

So what I want to show you
guys is some of the levels


852
00:41:37,976 --> 00:41:40,646
that really demonstrate
the highly realistic INKS


853
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:41,896
that I was talking
about earlier.


854
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,976
So there's that big color
swatch in the center.


855
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:49,126
And each time you hit one, it
explodes and reacts to force


856
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,776
and angle in its own unique way.


857
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:53,986
And check out how the
colors continue to blend


858
00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:56,176
into each other and
darken as they go.


859
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:59,506
The team spent a lot of
time studying water colors,


860
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:01,976
the physics of it, the
dynamics, how it dries


861
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:03,996
into the paper and blends.


862
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:05,236
It's really gorgeous.


863
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,746
And I'll show you just
one more level here


864
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:10,796
that just shows off how,


865
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:13,836
even though this is a
completely new take on pinball,


866
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:17,106
they still respected a lot of
the sound effects, and the feel


867
00:42:17,106 --> 00:42:19,536
of the bumpers, and habitrails,


868
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:21,366
and drop targets,
and the flippers.


869
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,826
I mean, it's really,
really amazing.


870
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:26,306
And I'm probably not going to
have time to finish this one.


871
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:27,916
I'll just let it go
down the drain there.


872
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:31,206
But I think this really
demonstrates how you can take a


873
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:33,556
traditional game mechanic
and with enough thought,


874
00:42:33,836 --> 00:42:36,216
attention to detail and
care, create something


875
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:37,936
which is completely
fresh and unique.


876
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:38,976
Brilliant job.


877
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:39,816
Thanks. Back to you.


878
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,976
[ Applause ]


879
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:46,006
>> Thanks, Mike.


880
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:49,126
So it's obvious that we picked
this game as a winner tonight


881
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:51,396
because it's really
well-designed.


882
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:53,236
It's rich and unique.


883
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,746
It's available in
five languages,


884
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:56,326
and it's exclusive to iOS.


885
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:59,676
And it's also really
interesting to note that a lot


886
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:03,876
of the conceptualization and the
artistry was done on an iPad Pro


887
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,366
with Apple Pencil by the team.


888
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:09,466
So they used some other tools,
too, to come up with this.


889
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:11,036
So that's INKS.


890
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:15,346
Our eighth winner today
-- a fitness app --


891
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:19,806
is Zova Personal Trainer by
ZOVA Group from Australia.


892
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:35,546
[ Applause ]


893
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,086
Congrats, guys.


894
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:39,146
Congratulations.


895
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:40,906
Good job. Well done.


896
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:41,436
Good job.


897
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:41,976
>> Thanks.


898

[ Music ]


899
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:50,906
>> So Zova is a fitness
training app


900
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:53,456
that helps people stay
active using motivation


901
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:56,796
and great HD videos that
look awesome on Apple TV.


902
00:43:57,356 --> 00:43:59,416
And we loved it because
it's thoughtful,


903
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,996
and in so many ways
they took little things


904
00:44:01,996 --> 00:44:03,266
and considered them deeply.


905
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:06,146
And it's really great
on Apple TV.


906
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,526
In fact, we like this app so
much that we took it with us


907
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:12,896
on the roadshow this fall --
the Apple TV Tech Talks --


908
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:15,256
and we used it as one
of the reference apps


909
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:16,556
in our design sessions.


910
00:44:17,096 --> 00:44:19,726
And we'd like to
show it to you now.


911
00:44:19,776 --> 00:44:20,016
So, TC?


912
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,026
>> Thanks again, John.


913
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:24,536
Zova is a fitness app
that provides short,


914
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,466
achievable, daily exercises.


915
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:29,306
Now this team here
they've been early adopters


916
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:33,526
of Apple technologies from day
1 with their initial release


917
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:35,416
of the app and HealthKit
support,


918
00:44:35,996 --> 00:44:40,506
to then Apple Watch support, and
most recently Apple TV support.


919
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:42,936
But they don't just
do it gratuitously.


920
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:47,406
They only deliver on
unique experiences conducive


921
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:49,826
to each platform
that feels natural


922
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:52,866
as if it always meant
to be that.


923
00:44:53,246 --> 00:44:56,556
And today, we'd like to
talk about the Apple TV app.


924
00:44:57,116 --> 00:45:01,866
So with Apple TV, they didn't
just upsize the content.


925
00:45:02,696 --> 00:45:06,046
They took the Apple TV
concept to heart and thought


926
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:08,806
about the whole medium of TV.


927
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:11,576
TV is a major part of our lives.


928
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:16,396
It's when we gather together to
enjoy content and experiences.


929
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:21,466
Now workout apps don't have to
be lonesome activities anymore.


930
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:25,006
With the communal experiences
afforded by Apple TV,


931
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:28,846
Zova had to think about the kind
of content that they can create.


932
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:32,416
This collection here called
Move Together is where you team


933
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:35,136
up with your friend and
actually workout together


934
00:45:35,306 --> 00:45:37,206
and get fit together.


935
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:42,686
But Zova didn't just stop
at rethinking content.


936
00:45:43,466 --> 00:45:46,156
They also wanted to take full
advantage of the Siri Remote.


937
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,486
As you will see me
navigating through this, it is,


938
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:51,866
as you would expect, very
easy to find content.


939
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:56,346
And focusing on elements
is easy, too.


940
00:45:56,346 --> 00:45:58,616
Let's go into this workout here.


941
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:02,146
So, here, you get
a brief description


942
00:46:02,146 --> 00:46:03,586
of what this workout is about.


943
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:06,146
And also, if you have
a look at the bottom,


944
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:07,776
these are video previews


945
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:10,616
of exactly what the
exercises entail.


946
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:14,286
That way, you know what
you're really in for.


947
00:46:14,286 --> 00:46:16,666
But where the implementation
of Siri Remote really comes


948
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:19,486
into its own is when you're
actually inside of a workout.


949
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:20,856
So let's try one of these.


950
00:46:28,436 --> 00:46:31,226
Each workout starts with a
preview, so you're reminded


951
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:32,906
of exactly what the exercise is.


952
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,196
Now I've just pressed the
Pause button, and it responds


953
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:45,546
as you would expect because
you will get interrupted


954
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:46,556
when you're trying to exercise.


955
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:47,486
That's just the way it is.


956
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:50,476
When you resume the pause,
it will give you a countdown


957
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:52,676
so that you can actually
ready yourself instead


958
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,216
of just jumping straight
into it.


959
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:58,456
But where it gets really
interesting is I'm now pressing


960
00:46:58,456 --> 00:47:02,026
and holding onto the Pause
button, and instead I'm provided


961
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:05,626
with a freeze frame so that
I can look more closely


962
00:47:05,626 --> 00:47:06,996
at the details on the screen --


963
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:10,566
perhaps the exact
posture of the instructor.


964
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:14,326
Now this is possible and is
beyond the standard controls


965
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:18,046
because Zova has implemented
a custom AVPlayerLayer.


966
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,396
Similarly, if I was
to swipe left,


967
00:47:22,626 --> 00:47:25,616
I can restart an
exercise very quickly.


968
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:32,376
Or, if I was to swipe
to the right,


969
00:47:32,376 --> 00:47:33,976
you can see I can easily skip.


970
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:43,046
Now you may have noticed
references earlier


971
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:43,836
to Apple Watch.


972
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:47,216
This is really neat.


973
00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:49,946
What's happening here is
it's taking my heartrate


974
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:50,626
from my Watch.


975
00:47:50,956 --> 00:47:55,746
And through HealthKit and
my iPhone, it is overlaying


976
00:47:55,746 --> 00:47:57,846
that onto the live
video stream here.


977
00:47:57,846 --> 00:47:59,376
So that's my heartrate
you're looking at.


978
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:04,246
Let's move along then.


979
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:11,586
At the end of each workout, you
have an opportunity to, I guess,


980
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:13,816
log your feedback as
to how you've done.


981
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:16,346
And this is a really fun
use of the Siri Remote.


982
00:48:16,346 --> 00:48:19,896
You can either give it a big
thumbs-up for it has gone well,


983
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:21,776
or if it's gone less well --


984
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:27,406
and in my case, I tend to
quiver my lips a little, too.


985
00:48:27,406 --> 00:48:27,976
So there you go.

[ Laughter ]


987
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:34,676
We really like Zova's
reimagination of content


988
00:48:34,906 --> 00:48:38,056
for the lounge and living
room, and the extensive use


989
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:40,446
of the features of
the Apple Siri Remote


990
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:42,226
so that you have a true


991
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:45,536
and unique Apple TV
experience in your lounge room.


992
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:52,436
Built using Swift, Zova
is exclusive to iOS,


993
00:48:52,436 --> 00:48:53,986

994
00:48:54,786 --> 00:48:57,016
Congratulations to
the team at ZOVA.


995

>> All right, that's Zova.


998
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:10,896
The next winner this
afternoon is Ulysses


999
00:49:10,996 --> 00:49:12,976
by the Soulmen from Germany.

[ Music ]


1002
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:37,646
So Ulysses is a powerful
text editor for writers


1003
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:40,286
of all kinds -- journalists,
bloggers, you name it.


1004
00:49:40,336 --> 00:49:44,116
And it's designed specifically
to cover all aspects


1005
00:49:44,116 --> 00:49:45,286
of the writing process.


1006
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:47,376
And we picked it as a winner


1007
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:49,736
because it's a tool
that's optimized


1008
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,786
for writing without distraction.


1009
00:49:52,106 --> 00:49:54,936
The entire UI of the
operating system goes away


1010
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:57,116
and you're just working
with your words.


1011
00:49:57,716 --> 00:50:00,336
And the execution of
this app is so great.


1012
00:50:00,336 --> 00:50:03,076
It allows you to work
on any of our devices.


1013
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:06,436
You can choose to start on
the Mac, then move to iPad,


1014
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:09,016
then move to iPhone,
and move back.


1015
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:11,596
And you get that
distraction-free experience


1016
00:50:11,656 --> 00:50:13,356
on any of those devices.


1017
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:16,626
And to show this app to you, I'd
like to turn it over to Michael.


1018
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,076
>> Thank you, John.


1019
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:20,586
So Ulysses is a focused


1020
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:22,806
and distraction-free
writing environment.


1021
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:26,416
It has the power of
classic word processers


1022
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:29,176
with flexible organization
and management tools.


1023
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:32,926
Now it's a super clean writing
experience and it has features


1024
00:50:32,926 --> 00:50:34,316
to help you through the task.


1025
00:50:34,756 --> 00:50:36,066
So the first thing, for example,


1026
00:50:36,476 --> 00:50:38,836
is I can highlight
the current line.


1027
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,596
That should look familiar.


1028
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:44,136
We can also show
paragraph numbers.


1029
00:50:45,266 --> 00:50:47,616
Now Ulysses is based
on Markdown.


1030
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:49,236
And what Markdown is --


1031
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,236
it's a markup language
that uses plain text


1032
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:54,196
and special characters
to set semantics.


1033
00:50:54,476 --> 00:50:57,066
So, for example, here you
can see that in this copy


1034
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:59,006
of the Apple TV human
interface guidelines


1035
00:50:59,796 --> 00:51:02,186
that navigation has
two hash marks,


1036
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,956
and that is a second-level
header.


1037
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:08,486
By the way, this tear-off menu
is from their use of AppKit.


1038
00:51:09,156 --> 00:51:13,056
Now Ulysses also presents images
and URLs in a user-friendly


1039
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:14,996
and vey distraction-free way.


1040
00:51:16,636 --> 00:51:19,536
Now Ulysses is really
customizable.


1041
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,636
For me, for example, I
like working at night.


1042
00:51:21,636 --> 00:51:24,926
I get creative after
dark, so I like Dark Mode.


1043
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,726
If Dark Mode doesn't
work for you,


1044
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:30,196
there are customizable themes,
or you can download themes


1045
00:51:30,196 --> 00:51:31,686
from the Ulysses User Community.


1046
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:34,696
Now Markdown is an open
standard, so they also ship


1047
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:36,656
with a number of different
markdown definitions,


1048
00:51:36,656 --> 00:51:38,196
or you can create your own.


1049
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:40,046
Both custom markdown definitions


1050
00:51:40,126 --> 00:51:43,926
and custom themes are all
synchronized using iCloud.


1051
00:51:45,256 --> 00:51:51,956
OK. Now this is a modern,
single-window, multicolumn app.


1052
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:54,066
So if you take a look all
the way on the left side,


1053
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:55,286
that's my library column.


1054
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:56,266
And in my library column,


1055
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:57,946
that's where I manage
all of my writing.


1056
00:51:58,316 --> 00:52:02,196
For example, here I have a
group of public domain books.


1057
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:04,466
I also have filters.


1058
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:07,316
Now a filter is sort
of a persistent search.


1059
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:09,796
So here, for example, I'm
searching for the word "Ishmael"


1060
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:10,776
or the name "Ishmael".


1061
00:52:11,136 --> 00:52:13,616
And all of the occurrences
come up, most of them


1062
00:52:13,616 --> 00:52:14,646
from the book "Moby Dick".


1063
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:16,426
And I can also change the icon


1064
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:17,836
to something a little
bit more appropriate.


1065
00:52:18,696 --> 00:52:20,826
I can also do ad hoc searches.


1066
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:25,916
So, for example, I know that
there is a single occurrence


1067
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,756
of the word "galleon"
in all of these books.


1068
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:28,416
And if I take a look


1069
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:31,266
at the search base using
the statistics feature,


1070
00:52:31,546 --> 00:52:35,006
I can see that I just searched
through about 1.3 million words,


1071
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:36,946
most of those written
by James Joyce.


1072
00:52:37,326 --> 00:52:39,916
And that's thanks to their
implementation of Spotlight


1073
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,376
and Grand Central Dispatch.


1074
00:52:42,216 --> 00:52:44,336
Okie dokie.


1075
00:52:45,386 --> 00:52:49,416
So let's go back here.


1076
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,686
Let's kill this.


1077
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:52,236
Let's go back to
our Apple TV HIG.


1078
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:55,216
All right.


1079
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:59,616
Now Ulysses is
delivery-agnostic,


1080
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,486
so it doesn't matter where
you're going to deliver from.


1081
00:53:01,486 --> 00:53:03,016
You can preview in a number


1082
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:05,676
of different formats
powered by TextKit, PDFKit.


1083
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:08,256
It can even publish
directly to Medium.


1084
00:53:08,256 --> 00:53:10,836
But one of the things


1085
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:12,376
that they've done is
they've allowed you


1086
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:14,226
to make your own CSS files


1087
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,166
to style the preview
exactly the way you need it.


1088
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:20,306
So, for example, here
I have an HTML preview


1089
00:53:20,306 --> 00:53:22,216
and I happen to have
an Apple CSS.


1090
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:30,566
And I can apply that
to my preview, like so.


1091
00:53:30,566 --> 00:53:34,076
And you can see how the
Apple TV HIG would look


1092
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:36,646
on an Apple website.


1093
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:38,336
All right.


1094
00:53:38,806 --> 00:53:43,636
Now as John mentioned, Ulysses
is available on OS X and iOS,


1095
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:47,506
eventually Mac OS I hope.


1096
00:53:47,506 --> 00:53:49,636
It implements Handoff.


1097
00:53:49,636 --> 00:53:51,296
It's available in 7 languages.


1098
00:53:51,676 --> 00:53:52,786
We love this app.


1099
00:53:52,786 --> 00:53:53,996
We use this app at Apple.


1100
00:53:54,286 --> 00:53:55,486
We're so happy and so proud


1101
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:58,316
that you guys have created
this and won an ADA.


1102
00:53:58,316 --> 00:53:59,516
So, congratulations.


1103
00:53:59,516 --> 00:53:59,866
Back to you, John.


1104

[ Applause ]


1105
00:54:06,296 --> 00:54:07,916
>> So, as Michael said
-- thank you, Michael.


1106
00:54:07,946 --> 00:54:10,786
As Michael said, Ulysses is
a great example of an app


1107
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:16,586
that takes advantage of iOS and
OS X, Handoff, iCloud and more


1108
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,536
to deliver an optimized
experience


1109
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:19,836
on each of these platforms.


1110
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:22,626
We talked about this new
opportunity of four platforms,


1111
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,456
and this is an app
that does a great job


1112
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:25,936
of heading in that direction.


1113
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:26,946
Congratulations.


1114
00:54:27,506 --> 00:54:30,546
All right, our last
winner today is an app


1115
00:54:30,546 --> 00:54:32,376
that is incredibly
state-of-the-art


1116
00:54:32,446 --> 00:54:34,506
and incredibly accessible.


1117
00:54:35,216 --> 00:54:38,976
It is djay Pro by
Algoriddim from Germany.


1118
00:54:39,516 --> 00:54:49,576
[ Applause ]


1119
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:51,656
You've been here before.


1120
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:52,556
You've been here before, sir.


1121
00:54:53,976 --> 00:54:55,626
Good. Congratulations.


1122
00:54:56,516 --> 00:55:02,596
[ Music ]


1123
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:04,796
All right, so djay Pro is one


1124
00:55:04,796 --> 00:55:09,206
of the first professional-grade
apps to fully leverage the audio


1125
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:11,676
and video capabilities
of the new iPad Pro.


1126
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:15,936
And these guys already won an
Apple Design Award in 2011,


1127
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,416
but they have done
so much since then


1128
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,356
and they continue to innovate.


1129
00:55:20,536 --> 00:55:23,276
And they have consistently
stayed in lockstep


1130
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:25,976
with us every time
we released a new OS,


1131
00:55:25,976 --> 00:55:28,506
every time there's
some new technology,


1132
00:55:28,736 --> 00:55:32,166
and every time there's
a new device to support.


1133
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,086
Really impressive.


1134
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:36,586
And we love this app because
it sets new benchmarks


1135
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:40,616
for performance, for features,
for use of Apple technology,


1136
00:55:40,926 --> 00:55:45,096
for multi-device support,
and for accessibility.


1137
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:49,186
And I'd like to ask Ryan
to show the app off now.


1138
00:55:50,026 --> 00:55:50,936
>> Hey. Thanks, John.


1139
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:52,186
My name is Ryan Dour.


1140
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,246
I'm an engineer on the
Accessibility Team here


1141
00:55:54,246 --> 00:55:56,166
at Apple, but I'm also a deejay.


1142
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:58,376
All of my life, I've
been visually impaired.


1143
00:55:58,376 --> 00:56:00,156
But during high school
and college,


1144
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,486
I lost most of my
remaining usable vision.


1145
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:05,166
I've always deejayed with
CD players and mixers


1146
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:07,526
because they offer a
hands-on tactile experience.


1147
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:10,136
However, with the rise
of digital deejaying,


1148
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:11,646
I was feeling pretty left out.


1149
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:15,596
About a year ago, I got my
hands on djay Pro for the Mac


1150
00:56:15,596 --> 00:56:17,866
and this external deejay
controller and I got back


1151
00:56:17,866 --> 00:56:19,736
into it, and it's been
a great time since.


1152
00:56:19,736 --> 00:56:25,816
However, djay Pro for iPad
takes accessible deejaying


1153
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:28,266
to a whole new level, and I'd
love to show it to you now.


1154
00:56:29,026 --> 00:56:33,376
So, over here, I have an
iPad Pro running djay Pro


1155
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:34,796
and this external mixer.


1156
00:56:34,846 --> 00:56:37,036
I'm going to go ahead and
throw on my headphones now.


1157
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:41,206
So, here's the thing
that's interesting.


1158
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:42,746
The external deejay
controller acts


1159
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,516
as an extension of
the onscreen UI.


1160
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:48,526
And so I can use it
to really create kind


1161
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:49,856
of a pretty cool performance.


1162
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:53,226
Also, you're probably wondering
what of this can I see.


1163
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:56,426
Not much. I pretty much can see
the light coming from the screen


1164
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:58,406
and some of the, you know,
colorful lights coming


1165
00:56:58,406 --> 00:57:00,926
from the deejay controller,
but that's about it.


1166
00:57:00,926 --> 00:57:03,066
So knowing that, we're
going to use VoiceOver


1167
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:04,106
to control this interface.


1168
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:10,006
Let's go ahead and
get the music started.


1169
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:12,756
OK, so the first thing
I'd like to point out is


1170
00:57:12,756 --> 00:57:13,596
that I have access


1171
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,036
to information I've
never had before.


1172
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:16,556
For example, the time.


1173
00:57:16,556 --> 00:57:18,266
How much time is
left on this track?


1174
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:21,146
Let's find out.


1175
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:21,936
That's perfect.


1176
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:24,226
OK. So I'm the deejay, I'm
supposed to keep the music going


1177
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:25,746
and now I have that
kind of information.


1178
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:27,946
I also can use these
tempo sliders.


1179
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:33,316
For example, if I touch it
right now -- hold on a second.


1180
00:57:34,256 --> 00:57:36,176
So we hear it's at a
standard playback speed.


1181
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:38,296
But if I slow it down
using the deejay controller


1182
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:43,626
and I touch it again,


1183
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:47,456
we can hear exactly how far
I slowed that track down.


1184
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:48,206
That's really cool.


1185
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:51,136
I also can use these
multidimensional effects pads.


1186
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:52,846
For example, if I touch
it the first time --


1187
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,806
but the second time.


1188
00:58:01,176 --> 00:58:02,176
Really cool stuff, right?


1189
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:06,016
So between these effects
pads, this external controller


1190
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,266
and all this accessible UI,


1191
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:08,886
I can do a pretty
cool performance.


1192
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:10,566
So I'd like to go ahead
and ask the stage here


1193
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:13,776
to please take VoiceOver
off of the PA systems --


1194
00:58:13,776 --> 00:58:15,566
that it's only available
to me and my headphones.


1195
00:58:17,746 --> 00:58:18,746
Cool. Thank you very much.


1196
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:19,916
And I'm going to
mix for you now.


1197
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:20,826
Here we go.

>> I've got to tell you --


1205
00:59:26,426 --> 00:59:29,286
this is an incredible
custom user interface.


1206
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:33,196
They did not use UIKit
with this interface at all.


1207
00:59:33,196 --> 00:59:35,456
They didn't get any of their
accessibility for free.


1208
00:59:35,866 --> 00:59:38,566
Considering that,
their implementation


1209
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:43,046
of our accessibility APIs is
nothing less than spectacular.


1210
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,796
So I want to let everybody know,


1211
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:46,956
and especially all the
visually-impaired deejays


1212
00:59:46,956 --> 00:59:50,946
out there, this app has
really enriched my life.


1213
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:53,986
So I absolutely cannot
wait to see what the rest


1214
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:55,796
of you developers
make accessible next!


1215
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,576
Thank you so much, John!


1216
00:59:58,236 --> 00:59:58,946

Ryan, you're the man.


1219
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:15,126
djay Pro -- a beautiful, fully
accessible, super sophisticated,


1220
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:18,776
high-performance app
built for iOS and OS X.


1221
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,346
Congratulations, guys.


1222
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:26,326
So those are our
winners this year --


1223
01:00:27,806 --> 01:00:31,266
two great student apps
worthy of a Design Award,


1224
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:34,876
and 10 other incredible apps.


1225
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,566
10 apps that set the
standard for this coming year.


1226
01:00:39,256 --> 01:00:42,596
Each of these apps has
something very unique.


1227
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:44,926
They entertain in a new way.


1228
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:48,016
They allow you to
communicate in a new way.


1229
01:00:48,756 --> 01:00:50,146
They educate in a new way.


1230
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,826
They solve real problems
in a clever or new way.


1231
01:00:53,826 --> 01:00:57,986
And they open doors for
people and enable people


1232
01:00:57,986 --> 01:00:59,536
to do things they
couldn't do before.


1233
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:02,916
And all of them are
incredibly well-designed


1234
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:08,946
and extremely well-executed
on all four of our platforms.


1235
01:01:08,946 --> 01:01:11,526
Now winners today get to
take home, as you've seen,


1236
01:01:11,526 --> 01:01:13,056
the Apple Design Award Trophy.


1237
01:01:13,056 --> 01:01:14,566
When you tap it,
it lights up just


1238
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:16,826
like the cover of your laptop.


1239
01:01:16,826 --> 01:01:17,566
It's very cool.


1240
01:01:17,566 --> 01:01:19,476
Go check it out from one
of the winners later on.


1241
01:01:20,086 --> 01:01:22,726
So you get the coveted
Apple Design Award Trophy,


1242
01:01:23,006 --> 01:01:25,306
as well as a prize
package including one

we make -- fully loaded.

[ Applause ]


1248
01:01:49,236 --> 01:01:52,786
All right, we wanted to wrap up
this day with this fun event.


1249
01:01:53,056 --> 01:01:56,296
It's always fun for me to do the
Design Awards, to be involved


1250
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,336
with this, to know
so many of you


1251
01:01:58,336 --> 01:02:00,626
and to see your apps
come along and then some


1252
01:02:00,626 --> 01:02:01,806
of them to arrive on stage.


1253
01:02:01,806 --> 01:02:04,006
It's always fun to
give out these awards.


1254
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:09,256
But before we wrap up tonight,
we just wanted to tell you


1255
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:11,566
about something else that we've
been working on that's fun.


1256
01:02:11,566 --> 01:02:15,826
And it's a little bit apart
from the Design Awards


1257
01:02:15,826 --> 01:02:21,096
that we've given out so far, but
it's a great way to end our day.


1258
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:24,546
And it does tie into
building something that's fun,


1259
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:27,426
and unique, and compelling.


1260
01:02:27,946 --> 01:02:33,106
So to talk about that, I'd like
to invite Ben Wolstenholme,


1261
01:02:33,106 --> 01:02:39,386
Cofounder and CEO of Madefire, a
developer of iOS and TV OS apps,


1262
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:40,636
to join me here on stage.


1263
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:40,816
Ben?


1264
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:50,576
[ Applause ]


1265
01:02:51,076 --> 01:02:51,586
Thanks, John.


1266
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:52,366
Great to be here.


1267
01:02:52,776 --> 01:02:57,106
So Madefire is all
about storytelling --


1268
01:02:57,576 --> 01:03:00,156
and in particular, comics.


1269
01:03:01,036 --> 01:03:02,906
We love comics because they're


1270
01:03:02,906 --> 01:03:05,276
such a powerful storytelling
format.


1271
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:07,746
People learn to read
through comics.


1272
01:03:08,396 --> 01:03:10,636
People escape into other
worlds through comics.


1273
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:15,766
Most of all, comics are
words and pictures perfect


1274
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:19,276
for the visual world
that we live in.


1275
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:22,196
We've been working closely with
Apple on something that we'd


1276
01:03:22,196 --> 01:03:23,476
like to share with you tonight.


1277
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,076
As you may have seen earlier,


1278
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:29,476
Apple today launched new
app review guidelines.


1279
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:31,966
They're very different
to the guidelines


1280
01:03:31,966 --> 01:03:34,636
that we're all used to, and
they're much more approachable.


1281
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:38,806
And after speaking with Apple
about this new approach,


1282
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:45,476
we collaborated to create --


1283
01:03:46,516 --> 01:03:52,546

1284
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:57,606
Oh, yes! App Review
Guidelines, the Comic Book.


1285
01:03:58,056 --> 01:04:02,396
OK. Apple has put a lot of
thought into reorganizing


1286
01:04:02,396 --> 01:04:04,886
and simplifying the
guidelines into five sections.


1287
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:08,066
And this gave us a great
opportunity to work


1288
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:09,316
with different illustrators


1289
01:04:09,686 --> 01:04:14,376
and to develop five totally
different graphic styles.


1290
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:17,006
Each section is a visual story.


1291
01:04:18,016 --> 01:04:20,076
And we really wanted
the visuals to react


1292
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:22,696
with the serious content
of the guidelines.


1293
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:26,226
It's created a pretty
wild outcome,


1294
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:29,596
and something we hope
will engage people


1295
01:04:30,086 --> 01:04:33,266
around these important
topics even


1296
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,446
if you think you know
the guidelines already.


1297
01:04:36,196 --> 01:04:37,646
It's pretty useful.


1298
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:41,466
The comic book will be
available for download


1299
01:04:41,466 --> 01:04:42,786
from the developer's site,


1300
01:04:42,786 --> 01:04:45,086
alongside the searchable
text version.


1301
01:04:45,936 --> 01:04:50,736
But you will get to take home
your printed comic book tonight.

Oh, yes, hard to believe.


1304
01:05:02,426 --> 01:05:04,956
In a world of screens,
a big part of what we do


1305
01:05:04,956 --> 01:05:07,056
at Madefire is enable people


1306
01:05:07,316 --> 01:05:09,996
to turn their stories
into motion books.


1307
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:14,086
As you can see, motion books
are a reading experience


1308
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:16,186
with motion, sound, and depth.


1309
01:05:17,316 --> 01:05:21,286
And we're thrilled to be
working on a motion book version


1310
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:23,276
of the app review guidelines.


1311
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:27,956
Here's a sneak peek.

all, to all of you who've done


1324
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:35,156
such incredible work over
the past months, years,


1325

as you worked on these apps
that tonight won an award.

Hats off to you.

amount of work designing

that we've got from this event.

from around the world.

We look forward to seeing
what you're going to create


1336
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:09,626
in this coming year, what you're
going to create based on things


1337
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:13,636
that maybe you saw this evening
that inspired you to move


1338

to a new level with your app
and with your development
