00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:21,426
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: Thank you.


2
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:22,266
Thank you.


3
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,566
My name is Trystan Kosmynka.


4
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:27,826
I'm in iTunes Engineering.


5
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:31,416
Myself and my colleague David
Hopkins are excited today


6
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,596
to help you get the most
out of App Analytics.


7
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:39,296
App Analytics today is publicly
available for all developers


8
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:40,726
with a valid developer account.


9
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:44,356
Sales admin or finance
role inside iTunes Connect.


10
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,326
There are no restrictions to
your use of App Analytics.


11
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,096
It's available to
all developers.


12
00:00:49,686 --> 00:00:51,716
Because there are
no restrictions


13
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:55,266
and it's publicly available, we
are excited to tell you that as


14
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:57,356
of today it is no
longer in beta.


15
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,121
[Applause]


16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,025
Thanks. So why does this matter?


17
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,566
Why do we care about
App Analytics?


18
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,996
Why is Apple excited to
bring this product to you?


19
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:11,276
We care because App
Analytics provides answers.


20
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,446
There are a lot of big
questions that you have


21
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:14,856
as app developers or marketers.


22
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:17,026
Are customers finding your app?


23
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:18,676
Are they installing the app?


24
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,536
Are they purchasing goods
inside of your application,


25
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:22,266
and are they returning?


26
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,166
Our goal with App Analytics
is that we can provide some


27
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,766
of these insights so you
can make great decisions


28
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:28,426
going forward.


29
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:33,466
Through these answers, we also
reveal missed opportunities.


30
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,716
A good example of this is if
your application is available


31
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:40,696
across all storefronts but
you have not yet localized


32
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:41,686
in a particular country,


33
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:44,466
with App Analytics what
you can see is you can see


34
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,826
that you have really
high App Store page views


35
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:50,046
in a particular country but the
conversion rate isn't so good.


36
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:53,246
If you maybe localize your
store presence to that language,


37
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,516
you make it more
accessible to more customers.


38
00:01:55,766 --> 00:02:00,796
This is the type of data that
we deliver with App Analytics.


39
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,006
With all of these,
our ultimate goal is


40
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,126
to help you build a better app.


41
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,776
You are here to learn tips
and tricks from experts


42
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,286
so you can build a better app.


43
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,516
That's on the development cycle.


44
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:14,886
We want you to know that your
responsibilities do not stop


45
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:16,296
after launch.


46
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,416
There is a whole new set
of things to focus on,


47
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:22,606
marketing your app, advertising
your app, adding more content,


48
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:26,026
new versions, maybe
there's price changes.


49
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,286
Your Store presence
is important as well.


50
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:31,476
All of that goes back into your
product development life cycle,


51
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,356
and it's really important
to creating a successful app


52
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,036
in a successful app business.


53
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:41,006
We do all of these things
with Analytics data.


54
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:43,626
Analytics has three
key data sources.


55
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:49,606
We have App Store data,
sales data, and usage data.


56
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:54,306
These three data sources are
combined to tell a single story


57
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,046
across acquisition
to engagement.


58
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:57,976
We answer those key
questions with this.


59
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,886
Are customers finding your
app, are they purchasing it,


60
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:01,966
and are they using
it and returning?


61
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,346
To understand these
measures better,


62
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,536
let's take Trip Guider 2.0.


63
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,056
We updated this this
year for WWDC.


64
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:11,366
Don't download it.


65
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,866
It is not real.


66
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,016
Here we are seeing
our App Store views.


67
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,806
What App Store views are is a
potential customer visits your


68
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,286
product page in the App Store.


69
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,806
That triggers an App Store view.


70
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,366
This is an example
of our Store measure.


71
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:28,496
Next ,we have app
units and app sales.


72
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:32,106
This is an example of
our sales measures.


73
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,926
In this example, I have
$2.99 for Trip Guider.


74
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,966
That's going to generate
$2.99 of sales.


75
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,046
This is what the customer
spent on your app.


76
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,156
App units registers
the transaction,


77
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:46,506
a single app unit would
be present in this case.


78
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,216
Let's move along to
the usage measures.


79
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,196
We have installations.


80
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,126
Installations is
different than app units.


81
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:55,286
This is a common
question we get:


82
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:56,596
What is the difference
between these two?


83
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:00,496
If I was to purchase Trip Guider
for $2.99, that's one app unit,


84
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,596
but it may generate
multiple installs.


85
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:03,196
It's one to many.


86
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,276
I could have purchased
it and installed it


87
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:06,526
on my iPhone and my iPad.


88
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,686
That generates two
installations.


89
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:13,356
Additional usage measures that
we have available: sessions,


90
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:16,916
active devices, and active
devices in the last 30 days.


91
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:20,435
What is important with these is
that it is again one to many.


92
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:22,316
I may have opened
this app, Trip Guider,


93
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,646
and visited Pigeon
Point in the morning.


94
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:25,516
That's one session.


95
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,736
I came home and shared
the experience


96
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:28,606
with family and friends.


97
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:29,866
That's two sessions.


98
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,296
But all of this was
from my iPhone,


99
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,826
and that's one active device.


100
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,416
So sessions is an overall
idea of engagement,


101
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,466
and active devices is, how
large is your device base?


102
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:42,096
Active devices in the
last 30 days is the same


103
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:45,556
as active devices; however,
the time period is longer.


104
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,636
I'm not using Trip
Guider every single day.


105
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:50,486
But if I used it in the
last 30 days, I register a 1


106
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:52,856
in the active in last 30 days.


107
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,366
The last measure
we're going to share


108
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,346
with you is in-app purchases.


109
00:04:57,636 --> 00:05:00,446
This is again a Store
or sales measure.


110
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,386
In-app purchases is like units


111
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,566
where it's the transaction
itself, not the price.


112
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:08,926
In this case I bought Northern
California maps for 99 cents.


113
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:11,386
What this will do is
it will take 99 cents


114
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:12,746
and adds it to the app sales.


115
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,716
So it's app sales and
in-app purchases combined,


116
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:18,516
but it will generate a1 for
the in-app purchase measure.


117
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,596
Combining all these measures,
we get to tell that story


118
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:22,816
of acquisition to engagement.


119
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,176
App Store views all the way


120
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:26,426
down to in-app purchases
gives you the idea


121
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,046
of the entire customer
life cycle.


122
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:29,566
That's great.


123
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,086
But how do you actually
get started?


124
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,216
We have good news.


125
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,796
This is probably the
easiest session in terms


126
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,036
of work generated for
you, the developer.


127
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:40,546
There is nothing you need
to do to get started.


128
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,446
No code you need to write.


129
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:46,006
There is no SDK that
you need to integrate,


130
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,106
no iOS framework
you need to hook in.


131
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:51,006
This is something completely
built into the operating system


132
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:52,536
and that you get for free.


133
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,206
You have to have a
valid developer license.


134
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:56,816
Sales admin or finance role.


135
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,696
Not a lot involved to
get going with this.


136
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:03,116
It is available for the
App Store, iOS apps only.


137
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,856
And it's available
for iOS 8 and above.


138
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:07,576
That means that data
is available


139
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,516
when it is generated
from apps on iOS 8.


140
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,746
Another important point is
that privacy is built in.


141
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,156
With App Analytics, we
wanted to provide developers


142
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:21,296
with a powerful functionality,
powerful feature and tool,


143
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,036
and we wanted to do so in a way


144
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:25,616
that we would not
compromise customer privacy.


145
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:29,176
This is built all the way from
the operating system to the UI.


146
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,336
iOS has privacy constraints
built in.


147
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:36,086
This means that our usage
measures, customers are prompted


148
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,696
with this display
where they can choose


149
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:40,206
to share sessions
and active devices.


150
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,676
We believe that customers
should have a choice,


151
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,756
and this is built
into App Analytics.


152
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,576
Data is available
in aggregate form


153
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,366
and not personally identifiable,
it's completely anonymous.


154
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:51,456
What this means for
you as the developers,


155
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:54,156
in the App Analytics
UI you see counts.


156
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:55,676
You do not see the raw data.


157
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:59,036
It is all available
in iTunes Connect.


158
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:00,976
It's available today,
it's no longer in beta.


159
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:03,646
Once you log into
iTunes Connect,


160
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:06,026
you'll see the App
Analytics module show up here.


161
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:08,496
That's it for the
static part of this.


162
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,116
I'll turn it over
to David Hopkins,


163
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:13,576
and he'll show you an
overview of some key features


164
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,386
within App Analytics
in an actual demo.


165
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:25,416
[Applause]


166
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,696
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Hi, I'm
David Hopkins, and I'm going


167
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:40,546
to give you a quick demo of
the App Analytics product.


168
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:42,116
When you log into
iTunes Connect,


169
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:44,666
you'll see App Analytics
alongside your other modules,


170
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,866
such as Sales and Trends
and Users and Roles.


171
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:50,246
When you click on App Analytics,


172
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,896
you will be taken
to the app list.


173
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:55,466
That's the entry point to
the App Analytics product.


174
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:58,856
From here you can see a
snapshot across all of your apps


175
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:01,826
across four key measures,
again measuring all the way


176
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:04,006
from acquisition
with App Store views


177
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,216
down to engagement
with sessions.


178
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:09,836
You'll see the value for
the current period as well


179
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,936
as a percentage change
from the previous period


180
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,486
to help provide some
context as to whether


181
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:15,556
that value is good or bad.


182
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,766
If you hover over the percentage
change, you'll see the value


183
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,806
for this period and the value
for the previous period as well


184
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,046
as the date ranges
associated with each.


185
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:28,946
The default time period
here is the last 30 days,


186
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:30,956
but you can change which
time period you're looking


187
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:32,765
at from the date
picker in the top right.


188
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,706
You can select from
any predefined ranges


189
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:38,736
or select a custom range as well


190
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:41,405
as selecting any
day, week, or month.


191
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:44,396
Now I'm showing you the app list


192
00:08:44,396 --> 00:08:45,596
where you can view
all of your apps.


193
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:46,986
Let's dive into one of the apps.


194
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,146
For those of you who build lots
of great apps, the easiest way


195
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:51,916
to find your app in
here is to search.


196
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,686
We can search for
our app Trip Guider.


197
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:58,206
When we click on the app
Trip Guider, we will be taken


198
00:08:58,206 --> 00:08:59,686
to the app overview page.


199
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:02,506
The app overview
page is designed


200
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:05,136
to give you a high-level
overview of your app.


201
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,536
The first thing you are going
to see is your all time data


202
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,046
for your app since it has
been in App Analytics.


203
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:14,186
Again we are seeing across
the same four measures we saw


204
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,976
in the app list with
App Store views,


205
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:18,826
app units, sales, and sessions.


206
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:22,786
Now is a good time to call
out that Trystan mentioned


207
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,456
that we take privacy
very seriously.


208
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,536
All of our usage data is
available only for the customers


209
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:29,986
who have agreed to opt in


210
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,726
and share their data
with developers.


211
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:33,586
You'll see this text
that says "opt


212
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,666
in only" below these
usage measures.


213
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:39,866
If you want to know your opt-in
rate specific to your app,


214
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,626
click on the question mark next
to About App Analytics Data.


215
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,816
We click on that, and we can
see for our app Trip Guider


216
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:49,396
that in the last 30
days, 23 percent of users


217
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:52,046
that installed Trip Guider
agreed to share their data.


218
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:55,076
As you move down the page,


219
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,046
the next thing you'll
see is a breakdown


220
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,216
by day across six measures.


221
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,596
Again, we are looking at
the last 30 days here.


222
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:05,096
You can see the value for
the current period as well


223
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,626
as the percentage change
from the previous period,


224
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,796
but now we have a little
bit more granularity.


225
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:11,376
We can see the graphs by day.


226
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:15,836
So for example, we knew that our
app Trip Guider 2.0 is killing


227
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:17,446
it in terms of App Store views.


228
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:18,626
We are up 82 percent.


229
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,556
But what we didn't know
is that the majority


230
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:24,306
of this increase came over this
five- or six-day period here.


231
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,956
We can also hover
over any day to find


232
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:28,456
out the value for that day.


233
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:31,666
We can see that on May 15
we had our peak in terms


234
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:36,856
of App Store views, when we had
around 160,000 App Store views.


235
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:41,696
As you move down the page, the
next thing you'll see is a map.


236
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:45,726
This is a map of your
app units by storefront.


237
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:48,716
Here we are looking at which
territories have the most


238
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,336
app units.


239
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,286
For Trip Guider, you can see
that most of the app units came


240
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,676
in the United States,
followed by Thailand.


241
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,506
Again, here we are revealing
missed opportunities.


242
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:01,956
Maybe we didn't know that our
app was so popular in Thailand,


243
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:04,656
and there's an opportunity for
us to go in and localize our app


244
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:07,186
to Thai to really
optimize the experience


245
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:08,496
for the customers in Thailand.


246
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,456
You can change which
measure you're looking at,


247
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:14,396
so this default's app units, but
you can select any other measure


248
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,256
that Trystan mentioned.


249
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:18,426
Choose sales, and
now we have a map


250
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,876
of our top sales by territory.


251
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:25,066
As you move down the page,
the next thing you'll see is


252
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,216
on the left-hand side.


253
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:28,616
You'll see a graph of
your users' retention.


254
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:32,626
Retention is designed to show
you whether your newly acquired


255
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,896
customers are staying
engaged with your app.


256
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,646
On the right-hand side,
you'll see a breakdown


257
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,786
of your app units by platform.


258
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:43,546
Again, you can change which
measure you are looking at here


259
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,506
to select from any
of these measures.


260
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:49,266
You can see that for our app
Trip Guider we have 68 percent


261
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,396
of our app units
coming on the iPhone,


262
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:54,066
followed by 29 percent
on the iPad.


263
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,856
Now I'm showing you the app
list where you can see your list


264
00:11:57,856 --> 00:11:59,896
of apps as well as
the app overview,


265
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,316
where you can see a
high-level view of your app.


266
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:04,786
I'm going to hand it back over
to Trystan, who will walk you


267
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,926
through how we can dive
into some of this data.


268
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,241
[Applause]


269
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,496
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA:
Thank you, David.


270
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,906
Gave a quick overview
of App Analytics.


271
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:15,736
We had the app list.


272
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,006
This is the best way to see all
of your apps at a single view.


273
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:21,316
And the app overview, the best
way to look at a single app,


274
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:23,646
you can see all of the
key measures in one place.


275
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:25,796
We have the beautiful
map, the beautiful chart,


276
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,326
and you can see it
broken down by platform.


277
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,056
That's just touching
the surface.


278
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:33,106
As a developer or marketer,
you want to see and explore


279
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:34,806
and discover new trends.


280
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,006
And you can do this with
a feature called Metrics.


281
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:41,216
What Metrics does, we
take those key indicators,


282
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,696
all of the measures
we talked about,


283
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,076
and we add in another
layer called dimensions.


284
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,736
These dimensions can
be used multiple ways.


285
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:48,856
First, as filters.


286
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,376
If you wanted to
answer the question:


287
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,666
How many sessions am I getting
on my iPhones or my iPads?


288
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,636
I can do that by filtering
sessions by platform.


289
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:01,216
What if you wanted to see
users, are they coming back?


290
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:02,726
You can filter by purchase date.


291
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,036
Is my app version being adopted?


292
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,306
You can do this by filtering
by app version as well.


293
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,236
Dimensions are a great way


294
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:13,276
to see certain measures
filtered by certain things.


295
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,116
You also can group the data.


296
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:17,926
If you wanted to see the
composition of your units


297
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,856
by a particular platform, you
can view by that data as well.


298
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:22,706
We will show these things.


299
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:24,776
So we have the measures.


300
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:25,516
We have the dimensions.


301
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,726
You can tell interesting stories
by combining these two things.


302
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:32,406
We are excited that as of today
there are new measures available


303
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:32,816
as well.


304
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,186
You can tell all-new stories.


305
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:37,196
The first one we are
introducing is Crashes.


306
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:38,466
This is a crash rate.


307
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:41,866
This will show up just
like sessions and installs.


308
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,816
It's a usage measure.


309
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:45,686
What it will allow you to do
is you can improve the overall


310
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:46,556
stability of your app.


311
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,396
If you've really focused on
quality on the next version


312
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,366
of your app, once the
app is in the Store,


313
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,816
you can filter crashes by
2.0 of your app and see


314
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,826
if you made the impact
you intended to make.


315
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,676
Next, we have a new
sales measure.


316
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:00,846
This is Paying Users.


317
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:04,136
If we look at sales,
sales is a number


318
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,946
that hopefully is
increasing over time.


319
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:08,296
But if you have users that
are purchasing multiple times


320
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,686
within the app, Paying Users
can give you that visibility.


321
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:13,816
It is the unique count of
how many users have purchased


322
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:16,766
within your app on a
given day, week, or month.


323
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:17,656
It's really powerful.


324
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:23,866
Now, on the topic of power,
we have all of our measures.


325
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:25,916
We have the two new measures
we are excited about.


326
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,246
There's also power
in comparing things.


327
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,186
I'll give you some practical
examples before David demos


328
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,596
of things you should
be commonly comparing


329
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:34,936
as you are marketing your app,


330
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,566
as you are making
product decisions as well.


331
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,466
The first is product
page conversion rate.


332
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:41,386
This is the overall
effectiveness


333
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,306
of your product page.


334
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,716
It is important to focus
on quality screenshots,


335
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:49,766
using app video previews, making
sure your text sounds great.


336
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:53,186
You do this by comparing app
units in App Store views.


337
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:55,506
It will give you an
overall score, so to speak,


338
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:56,846
of how that page is doing.


339
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,586
And you can compare this
across all of your apps.


340
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,316
Next is average revenue
per paying user.


341
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:04,946
We take that new measure, Paying
Users, and compare it to sales.


342
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,206
This gives me an
apples-to-apples comparison


343
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:08,586
across all my apps.


344
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,446
Are my users in app A spending
more than my users in app B?


345
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:15,006
This is a really important
metric that you can use


346
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:16,346
to grow your overall sales


347
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:18,466
and grow the overall
health of your app.


348
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,846
Next, crashes per session.


349
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,766
Again, Crashes is a
measure you want to use


350
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,166
to improve the stability
of your app.


351
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,876
You can use crashes per
session as a comparison


352
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,686
to see how you are doing
against your other apps.


353
00:15:31,796 --> 00:15:35,336
The last example we'll share
is sessions per active device.


354
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,926
This is taking the
Sessions metric


355
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,166
and Active Devices metric,


356
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,716
and by using these
two I get a comparison


357
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:41,756
across all of my apps.


358
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:43,946
I will turn it over to
David, and he's going


359
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,526
to demo the power
of the metrics view.


360
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:48,096
And again, these new measures,
Paying Users and Crashes,


361
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:51,266
this is data that you do
not integrate to SDK for,


362
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,996
and it's data that
only Apple can provide.


363
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,536
Paying Users comes straight
from the sales data.


364
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,936
It is something that is
unique to App Analytics.


365
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,676
>> DAVID HOPKINS:
Thanks, Trystan.


366
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:05,536
So when we left off, we were
looking at the app overview.


367
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:08,256
As Trystan mentioned, if you
want to dive into your data,


368
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:10,286
the best place to do it
is in the metrics view.


369
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:14,516
The metrics view is a tab
within the context of your app.


370
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,976
We can click that, and it will
take us to the metrics view.


371
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,236
You can click on any of
the data in the overview,


372
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:23,196
and it will take you to the
metrics view that data selected.


373
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,336
For example, we are looking


374
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:28,496
at our app units
broken down by platform.


375
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,386
Say we wanted to
take a deeper look


376
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,986
at our iPhone users
and our app units.


377
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:36,576
We can click on that, and now
we are taken to the metrics view


378
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:38,966
with our app units
selected, and we're looking


379
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,696
at just our users on the iPhone.


380
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,826
What you'll see in
the metrics view is


381
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:46,086
in the top left you'll see the
value for the period as well


382
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:49,766
as a chart where we break
down your app units by day.


383
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:53,186
If you hover over a day, you'll
see the value for that day.


384
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,006
If you scroll below the
chart, you'll see a table


385
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:58,986
that contains the
value for each day.


386
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,696
And if you scroll to the top,
the next thing we will talk


387
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:04,786
about are your measures.


388
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,076
On the left-hand
side you can see


389
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,056
that we have app units selected.


390
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,766
Your measures are broken
down by sales and usage.


391
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,836
If you have any questions
about any of these measures


392
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,026
at any time, you can
hover over the measure


393
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,435
and you'll see a question mark.


394
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,715
If you click on that
question mark,


395
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,165
you'll get the definition
of the measure.


396
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:25,726
So we talked about this
new measure, Paying Users.


397
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:29,796
You can see it says the number
of unique users that paid


398
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,056
for the app or an
in-app purchase.


399
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:34,816
Great. I talked about
how we are looking


400
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,776
at just our app units
on the iPhone.


401
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,516
To do this, we have
a concept of filters.


402
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:43,346
To add a filter, click
on the top right,


403
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:44,986
and you can add up
to two filters.


404
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,396
Right now you can see
that we are looking


405
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:47,986
at just our users on the iPhone.


406
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,146
We can click to add
a second filter.


407
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:54,096
So let's look at our users on
the iPhone in the United States.


408
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:58,846
And now we are looking
at just those users


409
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:00,606
on the iPhone in
the United States.


410
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:03,946
You can also change which
version you're looking at.


411
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:05,616
If you want to switch
between platforms,


412
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:11,636
select from iPhone
and switch to iPad.


413
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:15,226
Great. Now I've shown you how
to look at a specific value


414
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,666
within any given dimension.


415
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:20,026
Oftentimes, you want to
instead compare the values


416
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:21,016
within a given dimension.


417
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,866
To do this, we have a
feature called View By.


418
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:28,776
If we remove our filters, and
let's say we want to look at all


419
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,536
of our top territories
for our app units and see


420
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:32,686
which ones rank the highest.


421
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:36,326
We can select View By,
and select territory,


422
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:40,176
and now you'll see all of
your top territories plotted


423
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:41,746
over time for app units.


424
00:18:42,546 --> 00:18:45,436
Again, if you hover over
the graph on any given day,


425
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:47,916
you can see the value for
each of your top territories.


426
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,656
If you scroll down below the
chart, you'll see a table


427
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:54,456
that contains the total
value for each territory.


428
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,176
And you can see here that we
have five territories selected


429
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:58,806
by default.


430
00:18:58,806 --> 00:18:59,976
These are the top territories.


431
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:02,586
But you can also
deselect any of these.


432
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:05,296
We can deselect Brazil
and then plot Japan.


433
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:07,506
Now the graph will update.


434
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:11,276
The default view here
is as a line chart,


435
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,646
but you can also change this to
an area chart or a bar chart.


436
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,766
We can switch to area.


437
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:19,656
That gives us a nice view
of the overall curve as well


438
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,256
as a breakdown for
each dimension.


439
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:25,086
Okay. So now I've shown you
how to compare the values


440
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:26,296
within a given dimension.


441
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,466
But sometimes you're
more interested


442
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,696
in the relationship
between two measures.


443
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,026
One example of this that Trystan
talked about is the relationship


444
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,246
between app units
and App Store views.


445
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,476
You'll call this your
product page conversion rate.


446
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:42,606
What percentage of users are
landing on your App Store page


447
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:44,086
and going on to purchase
your app?


448
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,916
To do this, we have a
feature called Compare To.


449
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,416
From here, we're
looking at app units,


450
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,896
and we can select
another measure.


451
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,926
So we'll select App Store views.


452
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,636
Now you'll see both
your app units


453
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:58,076
and App Store views
plotted on the same chart.


454
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,466
The default view here, we're
looking at a dual-axes graph.


455
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:04,406
You can hover over any
day and see the value


456
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:05,886
for each of those measures.


457
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,946
In the top-left corner you
can see the total value


458
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,136
for each of those measures.


459
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,996
This is a really nice way
to view the relationship


460
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:15,406
between these measures, see
how they trend over time.


461
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:19,236
We are excited to announce
some new enhancements


462
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,436
that we're bringing to
Compare To as of today.


463
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:25,416
Instead of just being able to
view this on a dual-axes chart,


464
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:29,216
we added the ability to
view this rate over time


465
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:31,786
with the new feature
we call Ratios.


466
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,246
So from here, you can
select new chart types,


467
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,286
from Single Access and Ratio.


468
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,496
We'll select Ratio.


469
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:41,766
And now you can see the
ratio between your app units


470
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:44,386
and App Store views
plotted over time.


471
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:46,246
That gives you a nice picture


472
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,936
of that product page conversion
rate that Trystan talked about.


473
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:52,816
You can see here that
we're at around 18 percent


474
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:56,096
for the last 30 days,
but a few weeks ago


475
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:59,686
for Trip Guider 2.0 we made
some updates to our description


476
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:01,436
of the app on the
App Store page.


477
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,076
And thanks to App Analytics,


478
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:07,216
we are able to see the product
page conversion rate drop off


479
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:08,126
right here.


480
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,776
We got down to about 6 percent.


481
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,646
So what we did is we
went and updated the copy


482
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,006
to the description of
our App Store page,


483
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,986
and we saw that product page
conversion rate rise over time.


484
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:21,116
As you go on you can see
that now we are back up to


485
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,326
around 30 percent
conversion rate.


486
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,836
Great. Now I've shown you how to
use some of the power features


487
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,256
in the metrics view, and I'll
hand it back over to Trystan.


488
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:31,276
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: So
David went through metrics.


489
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,366
This is the best way to
explore and discover things


490
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,686
and reveal those
missed opportunities


491
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:35,606
within App Analytics.


492
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,626
If you want to dive deeper


493
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,536
than the overview,
this is that feature.


494
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,646
One question we have
not answered yet is,


495
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:43,186
how do people find your app?


496
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:46,036
This is a question that is
hard without App Analytics.


497
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:48,696
To do this, we have a
feature called Sources.


498
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:51,636
App Analytics has
two types of sources.


499
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:54,426
The first is completely
organic and free.


500
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:56,676
You do not need to do any work
to take advantage of this.


501
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:57,616
This is websites.


502
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,036
If you are actively marketing
your application on websites,


503
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,256
forums, maybe it's getting
picked up by the press as well.


504
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:08,096
Websites, any time a link to
your App Store page is present,


505
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,456
we capture the web-referring
URL and present


506
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,416
that to you in App Analytics.


507
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:17,096
It is important that these,
both websites and campaigns,


508
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:18,886
they slice across
your entire data set.


509
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:23,216
You are able to filter App
Store views, in-app purchases,


510
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,726
the new measures
such as Paying Users.


511
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:27,826
You can filter these
by the website


512
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:31,596
and see how effective those apps
are at increasing these metrics.


513
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:33,986
Next we have campaigns.


514
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,146
So websites is something
that you don't need


515
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,516
to do anything to
take advantage of.


516
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:40,026
If you log in today, you
should be pleasantly surprised


517
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,176
that there are websites
available for your apps.


518
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,516
Campaigns: you do
need to create them,


519
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,466
and we will talk about this.


520
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:48,986
The easiest way,
the vanilla way,


521
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:51,726
to create them is your App Store
URL, you add a provider token.


522
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:53,726
In our example, we have
one, two, three, four.


523
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:55,246
That is not your provider token.


524
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:59,606
If you use 1234, you won't get
campaigns in your dashboards.


525
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:02,866
You can then add
a campaign token.


526
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:06,626
My recommendation to you
is that we take an event


527
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,476
and placement approach
with this.


528
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:12,396
Think of WWDC as the event
and placement as newsletter


529
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:13,686
or forums or home page.


530
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:16,356
You combine these in a
single string, and that way


531
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:19,076
when you see it in App
Analytics, you know what it was


532
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,586
for and where it was running.


533
00:23:21,076 --> 00:23:23,966
There are all kinds of ways you
can do this, and we want you


534
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,066
to experiment with it.


535
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,416
We think it's really important.


536
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:30,036
The next way to create
a campaign is StoreKit.


537
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:32,586
If you're using StoreKit
today, all you need


538
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,506
to do is add two parameters.


539
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,546
Add the Provider Token
parameter, it's a constant


540
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:41,176
in this dictionary, and you add
your Campaign Token parameter.


541
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,466
If you are not using
StoreKit, it's an easy way


542
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:48,716
to create an in-app App
Store-type experience.


543
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,806
You can cross-promote your
own titles within StoreKit,


544
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:54,156
and it's the best way to
get a nice conversion rate


545
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:56,356
for installs within
your own app.


546
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:57,776
It is designed by Apple.


547
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,516
You don't need to create
your own mimicked App Store


548
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:01,076
within an app.


549
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,966
The last way to create
campaigns is smart app banners.


550
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,626
If you have a home page on which
you're advertising your apps


551
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,806
today, you've probably
seen this already.


552
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:11,826
If you're creating an app


553
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,166
and this is the first
time you're here,


554
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:16,836
you can add a meta tag to your
home page and that meta tag,


555
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,336
you can add a provider
token and campaign token


556
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:23,046
to your affiliate data, and
that campaign will be attributed


557
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,826
to all of the traffic
coming through.


558
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:27,756
To demo this, David
will come up again.


559
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:30,536
He's going to walk through
sources, how you see it.


560
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,616
He's also going to talk about
how you create a campaign


561
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:34,736
and how you can get that
provider token from the UI.


562
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:36,546
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Great.


563
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:38,276
So as Trystan mentioned,
there's two types


564
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,406
of sources we track
in App Analytics.


565
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:43,286
You have your top websites
and your top campaigns.


566
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:47,146
Websites are tracked any
time a user follows a link


567
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:50,046
in mobile Safari to
your App Store page.


568
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,636
For example, we have our
website for Trip Guider,


569
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,636
which is Trip Guider.apple.com,


570
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,846
and we've implemented a
smart banner that links


571
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,086
to our App Store page.


572
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,226
Any time a user follows
that link,


573
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:03,256
it's going to generate
a App Store view.


574
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:05,516
Any time the user goes
on to purchase the app,


575
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,646
it will generate an app unit.


576
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:10,196
And so on for sales,
and sessions,


577
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:11,626
and all of your measures.


578
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,126
This view should be familiar.


579
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:16,506
It's the same view we
saw for our app list.


580
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:18,886
Now we are looking
at our top websites.


581
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:22,806
You can click on any of the
websites, and you'll be taken


582
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:24,836
to the source overview
for that website.


583
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:27,626
Again, this view is going
to be familiar to you.


584
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,576
It is the same view you
saw for your app overview.


585
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:33,426
Now you are looking at
just your users who came


586
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:35,306
from Trip Guider.apple.com.


587
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:39,766
So the great thing
about websites is


588
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:40,856
that you get them for free.


589
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:43,846
You don't have to do anything
to implement your websites.


590
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,506
They just show up automatically.


591
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:48,916
Any link that goes to the App
Store page will just show up.


592
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:51,806
The other type of source
we have is campaigns.


593
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:55,176
Campaigns are great because
you can use them anywhere.


594
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:56,816
They are not just
working on mobile Safari.


595
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:57,736
Anywhere on iOS.


596
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:00,776
We can send out an email,
put them on social media,


597
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,796
but they require setup.


598
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:06,566
So for most of you, when you
log in you'll see something


599
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,576
like this like we have
for Trip Guider.com,


600
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:10,696
which is an empty
list of our campaigns.


601
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:13,576
I'll walk you through
how to set up a campaign.


602
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,656
For Trip Guider, we want to
promote the use of Trip Guider


603
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:22,056
in order to find
things to do for WWDC.


604
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:24,366
I'll show you how to set
up that WWDC campaign.


605
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,346
As Trystan mentioned,
all you have


606
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:29,696
to do is add a provider token
and campaign token to your URL.


607
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,556
But to make this even
easier, we have a tool


608
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:34,646
that generates the
campaign link.


609
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:38,336
When you follow this
link, you'll see here


610
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:41,486
that you have a tool
and all you have,


611
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:45,016
is you have your app selector,
so you can switch between apps,


612
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:46,266
we have Trip Guider selected.


613
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:49,316
And that will populate
your app's app ID as well


614
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,486
as that provider ID that
Trystan talked about.


615
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:54,356
And here we can enter
the campaign name,


616
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:59,696
so we'll say WWDC --
whoops, there we go.


617
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:02,926
2015. It generates
a campaign link.


618
00:27:03,716 --> 00:27:05,396
Now you can copy
this campaign link


619
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:09,066
and you can put it anywhere, in
an email, on your social media.


620
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:11,336
You'll start to see
your campaigns show up.


621
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,296
It is also important to note


622
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:15,856
that generating the
campaign link does not mean


623
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:18,606
that you'll see the campaigns
in your top campaigns list.


624
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:21,046
Campaigns will only
start to show


625
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:22,596
up once you have five users.


626
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:25,626
Follow that link and then
go and purchase your app.


627
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:29,586
So now that I've shown you
how to generate a campaign,


628
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,426
let's take a look at an app


629
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,276
where we've already
started use campaigns.


630
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:35,176
The easiest way to
switch between apps is


631
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:36,826
to use the app switcher
in the top left.


632
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:41,486
So we switch from Trip Guider
to our other app, Tide Minder.


633
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:45,796
And now we can see
the list of campaigns


634
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,446
that we set up for Tide Minder.


635
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,386
So, for example, we
set up a campaign


636
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:50,676
to track our home page here.


637
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:53,196
So we have our display
home page campaign


638
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:54,536
that is showing up in the list.


639
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:57,686
Similar to what you
saw in the app overview


640
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,496
and the top websites
overview, you can click on this


641
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:03,396
and you will be taken to
your campaign overview


642
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:06,266
where you can see a high level
of how this campaign is doing.


643
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,006
So now I've shown you how


644
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,766
to track these two
different types of sources.


645
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:11,476
We hope that you go
out and start setting


646
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:12,636
up campaigns right away.


647
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:14,246
I'll hand it back
over to Trystan.


648
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:19,106
[Applause]


649
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:19,866
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA: All right.


650
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:20,856
Thank you, David.


651
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:23,466
David covered the campaign
list, the website list.


652
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,786
Very familiar to the
app list as well.


653
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:28,126
It filters all of your data
by a particular website.


654
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:30,626
We show the top campaigns
and the top websites here,


655
00:28:30,826 --> 00:28:32,726
and then we have the
overview so you can see all


656
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:33,926
of it in a single shot.


657
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,226
If you're running a campaign,
perhaps you're paying


658
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:37,116
for the campaign as well.


659
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:39,146
This is a great view to
just look at and see,


660
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,316
how is it actually doing?


661
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:42,636
Is it money well spent?


662
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,446
Last question we'd
like to answer is,


663
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:46,296
are customers returning
to the app?


664
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:49,356
David mentioned there's
a retention widget inside


665
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,036
the overview.


666
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,136
We will go into this
in some more detail,


667
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,656
go over the retention feature.


668
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:57,236
Before we do that,
before we show the UI,


669
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,216
I want to give a lesson on
how this actually works.


670
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,246
We have a purchase date.


671
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,386
And what makes sense is that
100 percent of the customers


672
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:07,586
who purchase the
app are customers


673
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:08,306
on their purchase data.


674
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:09,306
They've remained customers.


675
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:09,926
They are retained.


676
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,706
What isn't as obvious is
that a couple days later


677
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,436
and all the way up
to 30 days later,


678
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:17,796
less of them are
actually active customers.


679
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:21,876
So here we see day two, 45
percent are remaining customers,


680
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,596
and then on day 30,
we see 10 percent.


681
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:25,806
So what we're looking at here
is a single purchase date,


682
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:27,406
and then seven days later,


683
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,396
20 percent of the
customers are retained.


684
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:31,116
We're going to bring this down,


685
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,356
and we see that June 1
is our real example here.


686
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,096
So June 1, two days later,


687
00:29:35,196 --> 00:29:37,016
45 percent of the
customers were retained.


688
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,716
One purchase date is great
to look at, but you want


689
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:42,346
to compare this because
you are making many changes


690
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:43,736
over the course of
time and you want


691
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:45,966
to compare multiple purchase
dates in a single shot.


692
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:47,616
We added June 2.


693
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,486
We have June 1 and 2 now.


694
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:50,846
Let's expand that even more.


695
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:51,466
That is not enough.


696
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,826
Now I see June 1 to June 9.


697
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,246
I'm looking at nine
purchase days.


698
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:57,066
We've changed the
numbers now as well.


699
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:01,246
At the top I have 45 percent
for two days after June 1.


700
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:04,646
At the bottom, June
9, I have 60 percent.


701
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,976
So it's a little hard to read
because it's a single color.


702
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,836
So what we've also done to
this heat map is we've added


703
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,566
colorization, so I can
see that 10 percent


704
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,716
of my customers 30 days
later have returned


705
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:17,016
on the June 1 purchase date.


706
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:18,816
That's a lighter
color indicating


707
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,146
that the retention is not
so good at that point.


708
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:22,906
Go down to the bottom right,


709
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,296
and I see a darker color
indicating there's a hotspot


710
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:27,436
there, those improvements
we made.


711
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,376
Maybe it was my App
Store presence,


712
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,096
but likely it was the
new version of the app


713
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,566
or new content to the app to get
people to come back and use it,


714
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:37,526
and I have a 60 percent
retention rate two days


715
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:38,176
after June 9.


716
00:30:38,526 --> 00:30:39,756
That's how retention works.


717
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:42,806
The easiest way to
understand it is to do a demo.


718
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:44,126
So we are going to
do another demo here.


719
00:30:44,436 --> 00:30:45,676
David will walk through
retention.


720
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:46,866
>> DAVID HOPKINS: Great.


721
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:49,286
So retention is available
as another tab


722
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,436
within the context of your app.


723
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:53,316
We are looking at the retention
for our app Trip Guider.


724
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:56,236
The first thing I'll talk
about is the retention grid,


725
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:57,426
which Trystan introduced.


726
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,876
On the left-hand side, you'll
see the purchase date for each


727
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,386
of the last 30 purchase days.


728
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,326
Next to that, you'll
see a number of devices.


729
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:07,596
That's the number of
devices that installed


730
00:31:07,596 --> 00:31:08,756
on that purchase date.


731
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,316
On the top of the grid
you'll see a number.


732
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:14,676
That is the number of days
since the purchase date.


733
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:17,046
So when we look at this number
one, it means we are looking


734
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,976
at one day after
the purchase date.


735
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,276
The easiest way to
understand the retention grid


736
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:25,286
if you are getting lost
is to hover over any cell,


737
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:26,736
and it gives you a
nice explanation.


738
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,356
So we'll hover over this
32 percent, and it says,


739
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:32,806
"32 percent of the devices
that installed the app


740
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:35,646
on May 13 were active
two days later."


741
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,096
So oftentimes you'll
hear people talk


742
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:41,946
about their day seven retention.


743
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:43,716
And as an app developer,


744
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:47,116
you know that people will
purchase your app and a lot


745
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,366
of times they come back
on day one or day two,


746
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,236
but then the usage
starts to fall off.


747
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:54,506
We like to measure a day
that is a little further out.


748
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,676
That's why day seven
retention is important.


749
00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:00,176
We make this easy to see
within App Analytics.


750
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,436
All you need to do
is click on the seven


751
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:05,496
and you can see your day
seven retention over time.


752
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:07,936
As the app developer,
your goal should be


753
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:10,396
to keep the users
engaged and try to drive


754
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,486
up the day seven
retention over time.


755
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,346
You can see that we start
out around 18 percent.


756
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:17,926
As time goes on, we are
increasing a little bit,


757
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,676
but our goal should be really
to keep our users engaged


758
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:22,366
for day seven and beyond.


759
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:26,696
You can also look at any
single purchase date and look


760
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,006
at the retention for that date.


761
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:30,426
So, for example, if we want
to look at our retention


762
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,716
on May 12, we can click on that.


763
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:36,426
You can see in the top left, now
we have a graph of our retention


764
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:39,016
for our users who
purchased on May 12.


765
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:43,796
It starts at around 48
percent on day one and goes


766
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,546
on as time goes on and
goes to around 8 percent.


767
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:49,936
Again, we want to focus here
on driving up our retention.


768
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:52,266
The last thing I want to point


769
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:55,056
out on the retention view is
the ability to add a filter.


770
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:58,646
Just like you saw on the
metrics view, we can also filter


771
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,026
by any dimension and
look at the retention


772
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:02,546
for just that dimension.


773
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:07,026
We can add a filter and
look at just our retention


774
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,076
for our users on the iPad.


775
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:10,596
Now the retention updates.


776
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:12,796
Great, that's the
end of my demo.


777
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:14,836
I hand it back to
Trystan who will wrap


778
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:16,206
up our session on App Analytics.


779
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:20,896
[Applause]


780
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:22,556
>> TRYSTAN KOSMYNKA:
Great, thank you, David.


781
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:23,796
That was retention.


782
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:26,426
This is answering the question,
are users returning to the app?


783
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,966
We covered a lot today,
first thing was the app list.


784
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:32,266
This is bird's eye view
of all of your iOS apps.


785
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,086
We also support bundles.


786
00:33:34,086 --> 00:33:37,486
So we have page views, units,
and sales for app bundles.


787
00:33:37,486 --> 00:33:40,476
These are storefront
and sales measures.


788
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:42,736
Next, he covered the overview.


789
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,716
This is your app at a glance.


790
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:45,986
All of the measures
are available.


791
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:47,586
There's the nice
retention widget.


792
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,346
You have the map as
well as the pie chart


793
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:54,056
for the platforms as well.


794
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:56,506
Metrics, you use this to explore


795
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:58,216
and discover new
trends within your app.


796
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,926
You can see the dimensions
are available.


797
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,656
We have the new metrics as well.


798
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,686
We have Paying Users
and Crashes,


799
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:06,286
those are new as of today.


800
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:08,085
Sources answers that
question of,


801
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,396
how are customers
finding my app?


802
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,676
Are they actually turning
into real customers?


803
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:15,036
We have the page views, which
are potential customers.


804
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:17,976
Are they turning into engaged
and purchasing customers?


805
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:22,306
Finally, are customers
returning to your app?


806
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:23,936
We answer this question
with retention.


807
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,956
We are excited about
App Analytics.


808
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:27,906
We hope you use it
to build better apps.


809
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,085
We hope this conference has
been a great week for you.


810
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:32,396
For more information, look


811
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,886
at the App Analytics
Developer Guide and look


812
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,235
at the developer forums.


813
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:40,576
We encourage you to talk to the
Evangelist as well, Mark Malone.


814
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:43,446
We will be downstairs
after this in a lab


815
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:44,485
for a short amount of time.


816
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,876
We also will be available
for Thursday's lab as well.


817
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,846
There are a couple
related sessions,


818
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:50,496
Promoting Your App with an IAd.


819
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:52,226
This already aired, so
we encourage you to look


820
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:55,916
on the video afterwards, and
the What's New in iTunes Connect


821
00:34:56,025 --> 00:34:57,136
that occurred this morning.


822
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,566
This is a great session.


823
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,926
We walked through new
metrics that will be available


824
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:03,356
in the fall for TestFlight,
and there's How


825
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:05,986
to Manage Your Store
Presence as well.


826
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:10,866
The labs again this
afternoon and tomorrow,


827
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,606
we will be available, the
analytics team will be there


828
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:14,456
to answer your questions.


829
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:15,606
Have a great week.


830
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:16,386
Thank you very much.


831
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:20,500
[Applause]
