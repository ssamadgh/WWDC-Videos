00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:15,736
[ Applause ]


2
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:17,206
>> Hi, everybody.


3
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:18,106
Good morning.


4
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:21,286
My name is Rachel
Roth and I'm one


5
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,556
of Apple's User Experience
Evangelists.


6
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:28,366
Now this session is
not about monetizing.


7
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:33,846
It's about having a great
experience with in-app purchases


8
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,716
because a great experience
is what's going


9
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:39,966
to keep people coming back
to your app or game time


10
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,836
and time and time again.


11
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:45,616
Think about the last time you
had a really fantastic meal


12
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:46,726
at a great restaurant.


13
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:49,666
So it's a place you always
want to come back to, right?


14
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:54,376
So this is the bigger
picture of what it takes


15
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,066
to have a great experience
with in-app purchases


16
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:01,466
and today's session is all
based on the assumption


17
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:05,296
that you already have a
really amazing app or game.


18
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:09,636
Your app meets the
needs of your audience.


19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,566
It's got a really
intuitive interface design.


20
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:14,636
It's been executed really well.


21
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:17,326
For game, it's just fun to play.


22
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:20,046
And there's really
no design secrets


23
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,546
or shortcuts around this one.


24
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:23,746
But I know that you guys
all have it handled.


25
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:27,316
So we don't have to dwell
on this for too long.


26
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:30,606
Now, if you're using the
freemium or the paymium model


27
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,456
with in-app purchases,
it's so important


28
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:37,756
that people can enjoy your app
or game without buying anything.


29
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,866
I mean, I think most of us
have had the experience.


30
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,746
You get a new app from the
App Store and you download it


31
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,846
and you launch it only to find


32
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:47,516
that you can't do
anything with it.


33
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,476
That's frustrating.


34
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:51,326
You need to make it
a purchase in order


35
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:52,866
to get some utility out of it.


36
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:57,086
It would be like if you bought
a mixer for your kitchen


37
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,316
and it didn't come
with any attachments.


38
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:01,166
You couldn't mix anything.


39
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,626
That would be really
disappointing.


40
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:07,546
And that's why mixers come
with a basic attachment


41
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:10,776
that you can use to mix and
see how great the mixer is.


42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,986
And then you buy some additional
attachments for specialty tasks


43
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:17,796
like making bread or
some kind of pastry.


44
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:21,146
And that's what you want
to achieve with your apps.


45
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:24,586
You want to let people really
enjoy the functionality


46
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:28,466
and the utility, the
quality of your app,


47
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,666
and then you offer
them advantages


48
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:34,676
or additional functionality,
some advanced features.


49
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:38,226
And when you offer those
things, you want to make sure


50
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,766
that you make buying easy.


51
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:43,996
And I know this probably sounds
obvious but I'm not just talking


52
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,986
about sending the
transaction to the App Store


53
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:48,056
and getting a response back.


54
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:50,686
You want to make sure
that the decision


55
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:52,906
to buy something is really easy


56
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,816
for the people coming
to your app or game.


57
00:02:55,796 --> 00:03:00,896
There's a lot of friction to
making that decision to buy


58
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,456
and a lot of it is
outside of your control.


59
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:08,066
But as app developers, you
want to eliminate any obstacle


60
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:09,306
to making that decision


61
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,356
to purchase something
inside of your app.


62
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,976
Make it easy as possible
because that decision


63
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:19,136
to buy is a fleeting moment
and there's many traps.


64
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:23,346
So one of the best
things that you can do is


65
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,926
to integrate your merchandise
into the experience.


66
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,626
I mean, people aren't
going to buy things


67
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,206
if they don't know
what you're offering,


68
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,456
if they can't see them.


69
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,146
I talk to a lot of developers


70
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:37,476
who create a really great store
section inside of their app


71
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,426
or game and then they're
really disappointed


72
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,716
because no one's going there.


73
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,146
They're not buying anything.


74
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,546
That's because people don't
know what you're offering.


75
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:47,046
It's kind of like the
difference of if I said,


76
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:49,026
"Do you want to buy something?"


77
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,936
Or if I said, "How would you


78
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,656
like a really great
drawing tool?"


79
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:58,126
And that's what you want to
help explain with your app


80
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,186
by putting the merchandise
out on display,


81
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:02,876
integrating it into
the experience.


82
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,366
But when you're doing
that, I'm not suggesting


83
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,906
that you become a pushy
salesperson about it.


84
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:12,606
Nobody wants this guy following
them around saying, "Hey,


85
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:13,676
you want to buy something?


86
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:14,706
Hey, hey, hey.


87
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:15,546
You want to buy something?


88
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,606
Do you want to buy something?


89
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:17,555
Do you want to buy something?"


90
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:20,296
Every minute, and that's
what you're risking


91
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,276
if you're flashing a lot
of alerts or notifications


92
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:26,486
or crazy animations to try and
entice people into that store.


93
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:29,876
It's really about timing.


94
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:32,676
And with some apps, it's


95
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:35,956
about offering the right
thing at the right time.


96
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,476
Like at a restaurant, when the
waiter brings you the dessert


97
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:40,556
menu at the end of the meal.


98
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:43,796
I mean, you might not
even want dessert, right,


99
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,706
but it doesn't feel pushy
that they offered it.


100
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:50,116
It would feel pushy if they
offered it to you before you sat


101
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,766
down and while you're
eating your appetizer.


102
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:56,136
So you want to think about
what's the right moment


103
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:58,486
to offer something
to someone and do


104
00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,896
that in a way that's
really thoughtful.


105
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:04,196
Now with other apps, it's
about the presentation.


106
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:08,376
You want to think about a
really great window display


107
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,206
for a store.


108
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,636
I happen to be very partial


109
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:13,516
to the Apple Retail
window displays.


110
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:15,736
I'm sure that will come as
no surprise to you guys.


111
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,616
Now they do a great job


112
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:21,306
of showing off the
merchandise and drawing you in.


113
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:23,596
It makes you want to find
out more about the products.


114
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:24,776
It's really intriguing.


115
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,976
And that's what you
want to think


116
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,586
about with your app
or your game.


117
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:31,216
You want to integrate
the merchandise in a way


118
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:32,756
that feels really natural.


119
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:36,736
This is Paper by Fifty Three.


120
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,586
It's an Apple Design Award
winner from years ago


121
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,906
that is still a fantastic
example


122
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:45,396
of integrating in-app
purchases into their experience.


123
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,806
If you haven't used it, the app
is designed to capture ideas


124
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,596
through sketches and
diagrams and notes.


125
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,656
And like that mixer
in your kitchen,


126
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,246
they give you some basic
drawing tools for free,


127
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,446
your pen and your eraser.


128
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:02,946
And you can see from
this example


129
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,386
that you can do tons with it.


130
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,446
But there might be an occasion


131
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,306
when you need a more advanced
drawing tool or a different kind


132
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:13,746
of line or texture and so that's
why they leave these empty spots


133
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,226
here where the advanced
drawing tools should go.


134
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:19,626
And that's like that
window display in the store.


135
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:21,606
It's putting them
out for you to see.


136
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,026
There's no question
what's available.


137
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,536
What they didn't do
is hide everything


138
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:30,936
in an arts supply store or
tuck it in a pencil case


139
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:33,836
that then you have to go push
open to see what's available.


140
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:35,186
That's creating friction.


141
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:38,356
That's expecting the
player, or your audience


142
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,836
to do work, to see what's there.


143
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:44,956
And another thing that
they didn't do is trick you


144
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:47,106
into thinking that you
already owned all these tools.


145
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,486
Because if you could see them
all but then when you tapped


146
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,666
on one to use it, it
told you that you need


147
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,006
to pay money just
to test out a brush?


148
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,696
Well, that would
be disappointing.


149
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:58,916
That's not a great experience.


150
00:06:58,916 --> 00:06:59,926
It's a frustrating one.


151
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:05,016
And that's why this design
is so elegant and so great.


152
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:07,876
It's informative
but it's not pushy.


153
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:13,346
Now next up, let's look at that
timing I mentioned earlier,


154
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,176
a totally different kind of
app, Bloomberg Businessweek.


155
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,716
And this is a business
publication


156
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:20,936
that has regular
updates, new content.


157
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:25,366
And without a subscription, you
can still browse, read several


158
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,856
of the articles,
browse all the headlines


159
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:31,146
and the introductory sentences.


160
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:34,696
Now if you tap on something
that requires a subscription,


161
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,396
they bring up the
subscription options.


162
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,606
It's like the dessert menu.


163
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,466
You're interested in
reading some of their content


164
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:47,686
so here's the information about
subscription so you can get it.


165
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:51,776
They're presenting it right
at that perfect moment.


166
00:07:53,346 --> 00:07:56,056
They're making it easy for
you to get the subscription.


167
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:01,206
Now, they also have this
Subscribe button down here


168
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:05,066
in the corner of every
screen and that's great too.


169
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,506
But having that in addition


170
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:10,226
to the integrated message
helps them reach more people.


171
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,616
So I'm not saying you
can't have a store section.


172
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:15,936
You just don't want to
make it the only place


173
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,336
that people can find
what you're offering.


174
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:23,036
Now this also works for games.


175
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:25,456
I don't know how many of
you have played "Smash Hit".


176
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:29,266
It's a really fun arcade game
that involves smashing things


177
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:33,086
as you might have guessed, very
satisfying after a long day.


178
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,106
The way that it works is
that it's an arcade game


179
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:39,046
and the more accurate you
are at smashing things,


180
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:39,956
the further you're going to get.


181
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,316
You progress through the
checkpoints unlocking them.


182
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:46,076
And they also offer a premium
version and they've a great way


183
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,686
of illustrating exactly what


184
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:48,886
that advanced feature
does for you.


185
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:52,056
[ Music ]


186
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:53,316
So here we are.


187
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:54,766
Let's start from checkpoint 2,


188
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,976
maybe I can get a little
bit further this time.


189
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:00,626
[ Music ]


190
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,186
Oh, but this requires
the premium version


191
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:03,976
and I'm not ready to buy it.


192
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:07,696
[ Music ]


193
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,626
Pretty compelling, right?


194
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,006
I mean, if you had any doubt
about what that advantage is


195
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:15,046
that they're offering,
that spells it


196
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:16,186
out for you right away.


197
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:19,296
Now I don't know how
many of you notice


198
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,336
that there's also this
Get Premium button here


199
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,126
in the corner.


200
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:26,626
And if you did, would
you have guessed


201
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:28,196
that that's what the
premium version meant?


202
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:31,866
I mean, some of you might
have tapped on it to find out


203
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,486
and some of you may not have.


204
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,696
And they have the details
here about what you get.


205
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:38,936
But having this in addition


206
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:42,936
to that integrated message
is just much more effective


207
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:46,816
at explaining what the feature
does for you and offering it


208
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,966
to you at the time
that you can use it.


209
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:54,016
Just remember, don't
be this guy.


210
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:58,636
Nobody wants someone pushing
in your face pestering you.


211
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:02,776
Pestering people is not going to
get the results that you want.


212
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:05,746
But thoughtful integration
of the merchandise will.


213
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:11,916
Now another challenge is to
help people understand the value


214
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,026
of what you're offering.


215
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,076
And if you walked
into a clothing store,


216
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:17,596
this is easy to figure out.


217
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:21,256
You can touch the merchandise,
feel what the fabric feels like.


218
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:25,076
Does it feel luxurious or
does it feel kind of cheap?


219
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:26,846
Is it well made?


220
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,186
Are the seams are falling apart?


221
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,626
Most importantly,
does it fit you?


222
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:31,656
Does it look good?


223
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:33,026
Is it going to suit
your purposes?


224
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,166
So letting people try


225
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,656
out merchandise before they buy
it is a really effective way


226
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,636
of helping them understand
the quality and the value


227
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,256
and the utility of
what you're offering.


228
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:48,906
I mean, you wouldn't buy
a car without taking it


229
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:50,676
for a test drive first, right?


230
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,546
It's the same principle.


231
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:55,796
Letting people use it will
be the best way for them


232
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,716
to understand how
awesome they are.


233
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,466
And again, Paper by Fifty Three
does a great job with this.


234
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,906
In addition to providing
a lot of samples


235
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:08,086
of what the tools
are capable of,


236
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,726
they put together an
entire journal made


237
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:13,466
by their staff showing
off the different tools


238
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,456
and their capabilities.


239
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,526
And then of course, they
let you use the tools,


240
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:18,966
the basic tools for free.


241
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:22,846
And if you haven't used
this app, I can tell you


242
00:11:22,846 --> 00:11:25,326
that the tools respond
beautifully to your finger.


243
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:29,566
Now me telling you that
isn't nearly as effective


244
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:33,466
as you actually using the app
and so that's why when you go


245
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,376
to find out about these
advanced drawing tools,


246
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,926
they let you test
them out right there.


247
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,806
You've got these sketch pads
along with detailed information


248
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:44,976
and testing them out is how
you can determine the quality


249
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:45,776
and the utility.


250
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:47,826
What kind of texture
do they provide?


251
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,146
How do they react to your
finger when you're drawing?


252
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,966
Which one is going to be right


253
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:53,246
for what you're trying
to achieve?


254
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,336
And each of those sketch
pads has drawings already


255
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,206
in progress.


256
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,276
It's kind of like the test
drive where they take you


257
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:03,816
down certain roads to show
you how well the car handles?


258
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:07,046
Paper by Fifty Three is
setting up the sketchpads


259
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:09,146
to show you the optimal uses


260
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,376
or some suggested
uses for those tools.


261
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,366
This one's great at watercolors.


262
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,376
They've set up a
watercolor drawing for you


263
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:19,286
so then you can jump in and add
on or try your own drawings.


264
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:24,016
And it might seem obvious
to take this approach


265
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:26,196
with drawing tools but
I promise it will work


266
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,136
for almost any kind
of virtual good.


267
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:31,746
Here's a really different
example and that's Line.


268
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,256
So it's a popular messaging app.


269
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:37,486
You can send and receive
messages for free.


270
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,836
Now one of the things
that differentiates Line


271
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:44,516
from its competitors
is the vast array


272
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,476
of stickers that they offer.


273
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,276
Stickers are kind of
like really crazy Emoji.


274
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:52,386
You can include them in your
messages and send them back


275
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,046
and forth to your friends.


276
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:56,146
It gives your text
messages a whole new life.


277
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:59,866
Now Line gives you a
very generous selection


278
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,036
of these stickers for
free so you can try them


279
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:05,106
out plus the ability
to earn stickers


280
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:06,256
without paying anything.


281
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,556
So all you have to do is
add Hello Kitty as a friend


282
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:10,986
and then you get
Hello Kitty stickers.


283
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:13,506
And some people love
Hello Kitty stickers.


284
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:20,156
And using them really helps you
understand how great they are.


285
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,066
Now another thing that
they offer are themes.


286
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:27,226
And when I first investigated
themes, I'll be honest,


287
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:30,106
I had no idea what to expect
and I thought, "Oh great,


288
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:31,106
there's some free ones.


289
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,516
Let me try out the Brown Bear."


290
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:34,786
Let's see what happens here.


291
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,906
So when you choose
the Brown Bear theme,


292
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:41,916
instead of getting the
standard UI, you get bears!


293
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,236
Hurray! Everywhere,
all over the place.


294
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,606
Even the tab bar
icons are bears.


295
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:52,636
Now, sure they could have put a
description of what a theme is


296
00:13:52,636 --> 00:13:55,286
or even a screenshot but that
wouldn't have been nearly


297
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:58,706
as effective at conveying what
happens when you use the themes.


298
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:02,766
Giving people some free ones
to try out is the best way


299
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,606
to really understand
what they're all about.


300
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:09,306
And this works for publications.


301
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:11,226
Does anyone have any
question about where


302
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,676
to get the free preview
content on the screen?


303
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:16,496
They've made it really
easy for everybody.


304
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:21,196
"Esquire Magazine" wants
to make sure that you know


305
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:22,476
that reading their content


306
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:25,346
on an iPad is the best
experience possible.


307
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:28,846
And so they give you free
content to check out.


308
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,766
It's got videos, interactivity
and this is the equivalent


309
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:36,076
to standing in line at the store
and flipping through a magazine


310
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,906
or going to a comics store
and checking out the artwork.


311
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,356
It helps you to really know
whether the reading experience


312
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:44,366
is going to be good and
whether the content's going


313
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,466
to be something that
you're interested in.


314
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,956
And again, this also
works for games.


315
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,566
Now, I'm pretty sure
that everyone


316
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,556
in this room has played Candy
Crush Saga at some point


317
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,506
but for the 2 of you who
haven't, it's a puzzle game.


318
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:05,256
And they've done okay with
in-app purchases, you know.


319
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,296
So what they do at the
beginning of every level is


320
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,936
that they offer you
these boosters.


321
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:13,516
And these boosters give you a
leg up on completing the task


322
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:15,746
and they've become much
more valuable the harder the


323
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:16,436
puzzle is.


324
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,856
And if you've never used one,
you can just ignore them,


325
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,316
go for that big pink play button
and you're into a puzzle game.


326
00:15:25,316 --> 00:15:28,326
So that's why they introduced
the Daily Booster Wheel.


327
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,666
Every day you can come and get
one of their boosters for free.


328
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:37,306
So there is nothing standing in
the way of you trying them out.


329
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:39,386
And once you try them out,


330
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:41,656
you really know what a
difference that they can make.


331
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:46,596
So that's what I mean about
offering a test drive.


332
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,066
Letting someone really
experience that merchandise,


333
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:53,226
trying it out before they
buy it, is the best way


334
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:57,386
to communicate the value and
the usefulness and the quality.


335
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:01,036
And that's why it's going
to make the decision


336
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:06,056
to buy something
easier on people.


337
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:09,186
Now, another way to reduce
the friction to buying is


338
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,366
to stick with your theme.


339
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,836
It's really important that
every screen in your app


340
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,556
or your game is cohesive.


341
00:16:16,556 --> 00:16:18,196
And you want to carry


342
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:20,486
that visual design
all the way through.


343
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:22,986
That interaction model
needs to be consistent.


344
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:26,826
And you want to put as
much effort and time


345
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:29,866
into designing these screens
as you do anything else


346
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,176
in your app or your game.


347
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:36,806
So this is Ruzzle Adventure
and it's got hundreds of levels


348
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:39,366
of puzzle games and all
these various theme worlds.


349
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,086
You start out in the
forest and you work


350
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,126
through the different
puzzles in the forest


351
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:46,476
to get to other lands.


352
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:51,386
Now, every aspect of the
forest looks like the forest.


353
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:54,456
They've got -- it doesn't matter
the objective of the game.


354
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:58,086
You can see the forest details
creeping in at every corner.


355
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,446
Now there are in-app purchases
involved and in-app currency


356
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:06,685
which you can use to
then buy advantages


357
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,935
for the different
levels, powerful boosts.


358
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:12,476
And you can earn the in-app
currency as you're playing


359
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,996
but you can also, of course,
make an in-app purchase


360
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:17,086
for their in-app currency.


361
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:20,506
So imagine you're up against
Chief Smartypants here


362
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,506
and he's tough.


363
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,996
So it might be worth
getting some in-app currency


364
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:28,286
so that you can -- so that you
go buy some in-app currency


365
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,256
so you can get some
of those boosters.


366
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:32,786
So imagine you're excited.


367
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,366
You want to beat
Chief Smartypants.


368
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:36,726
But the next screen
you saw was this.


369
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:39,306
It would be terrible, right?


370
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:42,886
I mean, suddenly there's
an entirely different UI


371
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,426
that you have to understand.


372
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,216
You got to think about it.


373
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:47,866
It's really sterile-looking.


374
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,436
It's not very well laid out.


375
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,476
It takes you right
out of the experience.


376
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:53,816
You're not in the
forest anymore.


377
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,296
And that creates friction.


378
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,156
It makes you feel
more like work.


379
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,786
That's making it
harder to buy something.


380
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:04,996
Now thankfully, Ruzzle
Adventure does not do that.


381
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,806
They have a nice forest
theme purchasing experience


382
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:11,656
and all the visual design
and interaction is consistent


383
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:14,686
with everything else
in the game.


384
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:19,436
So make sure that you
maintain the world of your game


385
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:22,226
or the look of your app
on every single screen


386
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,956
and with every single control.


387
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,436
Because when you suddenly
snatch people out of that world


388
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:31,246
and they have to deal with a
new interface or a new look,


389
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:32,596
it's going to feel like work.


390
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,196
It's going to be hard.


391
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,696
And buying, we want
it to be easy, right?


392
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:41,676
Now just a word of warning
while you are busy sticking


393
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:44,156
with your theme,
don't take it so far


394
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,046
that language becomes confusing.


395
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:47,666
You want to make sure


396
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,176
that people can really
understand exactly what they're


397
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,336
going to be getting
for their money.


398
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:53,066
You use clear language.


399
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:57,226
Now have you guys ever seen a
description for an apartment


400
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:00,046
or house that said something
like "needs a little work"?


401
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,836
And then you show up
and it's, you know,


402
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:03,876
it looks more like this.


403
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,436
I think we've all
had that experience.


404
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:11,696
Now with any purchase, it's
so important to be honest.


405
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:14,826
There is really a fine line
between trying to be positive


406
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,746
about something,
highlighting the features


407
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:19,076
and really being
overly optimistic


408
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,156
about what you're selling.


409
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:23,666
Nobody wants to be disappointed


410
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,636
when they see what the
merchandise actually is.


411
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:30,306
And especially when you're
coming to subscriptions


412
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:34,396
or recurring content, you want
to be as specific as possible.


413
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,206
Set people's expectations
correctly.


414
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,956
When are they going
to get new content?


415
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,216
How much content are they
getting for the price?


416
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:46,436
And if you just saw something
like this, you don't know.


417
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,896
Is it expensive or
is it a bargain?


418
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,026
I mean, if it's 12
issues in a year,


419
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,566
that's less than
a dollar an issue.


420
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:55,946
That's pretty reasonable, right?


421
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,596
But if it's only two
issues, well, I don't know.


422
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:03,116
Is that content really
worth that much money to me


423
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,566
and see now, I'm off
thinking about whether


424
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:08,146
or not this is a purchase
I want to make instead


425
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:11,466
of quickly coming to a decision,
getting the new content


426
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:12,766
and going off to enjoy it


427
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,816
because that's what I've
come to an app to do.


428
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,756
I've come to enjoy content.


429
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,226
I've come to an app to
help me achieve something.


430
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,296
Jamie Oliver does a much
better job with this.


431
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:27,456
He's a famous chef and
he has a recipes app.


432
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,646
And you'll see here that
here they let you know


433
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,206
that new content is coming


434
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:35,286
on the second Wednesday
of every month.


435
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,156
Crystal clear, very specific.


436
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:41,456
I know exactly when
to expect things.


437
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:45,926
FitStar is a personal
training application


438
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,536
and they have a number of
workouts and they're tailored


439
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:53,366
to your goals and also
your actual performance.


440
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:57,856
Now their subscription screen
gives you detailed outlines


441
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:58,746
of all the programs.


442
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,276
I mean, you can find out
the length of the workouts.


443
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,396
Do you want something short?


444
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,536
Do you want something long?


445
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,956
They are offering both of
those, the advantages of them.


446
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,596
Are you interested in fat
burning or are you trying


447
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:12,556
to do strength training?


448
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:17,126
They've even pointed out which
one is recommended for me based


449
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,946
on a couple of questions
I answered earlier.


450
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:23,186
And when you're ready to
buy that subscription,


451
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,486
that screen is so clear about
exactly what you're going


452
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,606
to be getting, all
of the programs,


453
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:31,346
unlimited free style moves.


454
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,546
And they've even highlighted
the annual subscription


455
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:37,206
with a discount.


456
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,356
They've made it so easy
just through the use


457
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:42,956
of clear language for
me to make a decision


458
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,046
about buying something.


459
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,446
And now I really understand
what I'm getting for my money


460
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,386
and I can appreciate it.


461
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:53,346
Now another way that
you can make this clear


462
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,876
to your audience is to
do the math for them.


463
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,766
I don't like doing math.


464
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:00,036
That's not fun for me.


465
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:01,176
Don't make me do the math.


466
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,866
It's your job as the app
developer to make it easy


467
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,196
on people to make a decision.


468
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,016
So quick, which one of
these is the best value?


469
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:14,456
I mean, I'm sure some of you can
really quickly calculate this


470
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:16,226
but most people are
not going to want to.


471
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,016
It's this one, by the way.


472
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:22,966
And so that's why you really
want to help people understand


473
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,266
which is going to be the
most cost effective for them.


474
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:27,916
This is Lovoo.


475
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,406
It's a dating application and
they offer tons of utility


476
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:32,766
without a subscription.


477
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:36,636
You can fill out a
profile, message users.


478
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:39,126
There's lots of ways to
browse potential suitors,


479
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:40,076
including this.


480
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:41,216
This is a radar screen.


481
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,276
That's what you're seeing here.


482
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:46,256
You can see all the people,
all potential dates around me.


483
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:50,876
And of course, they have some
premium features that'll help


484
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:52,356
you get more exposure to people.


485
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:57,286
And here is how they explain
the subscription options.


486
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,956
It's called pennies
a day to find love.


487
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,116
Pennies a day to find love!


488
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,826
Who can afford pennies
a day for love?


489
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,856
Now, there's no guesswork here.


490
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,696
I know exactly which
subscription is going


491
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,496
to be the lowest cost per day.


492
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:15,916
But it's really important.


493
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,756
If you're going to
take it to this level,


494
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,846
make sure that you're
still calling


495
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:22,286
out the total purchase
price because again,


496
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:24,826
we want to be honest and
clear with our language.


497
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:28,016
People are going to want to
know what they expect to pay.


498
00:23:28,286 --> 00:23:30,256
Don't make them do the
math in reverse, right?


499
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:34,796
Now, if your app is available
worldwide, I want to make sure


500
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,516
that you localize your currency


501
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:38,776
because that's a huge
roadblock if you don't.


502
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:44,456
So that's what I mean about
doing the math for people.


503
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:49,746
It can be so helpful in
making that decision quickly.


504
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:53,816
Now, another thing that's really
helpful is showing fewer things.


505
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:57,176
It's about quality,
not about quantity.


506
00:23:57,856 --> 00:24:00,806
Too many choices, you
risk overwhelming people.


507
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,236
And I don't know how
many of you have heard


508
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,866
of the paradox of choice.


509
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:08,176
It essentially means that the
more choices that you have,


510
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,236
the harder it is
to make a decision.


511
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:13,666
And in fact, when
you've too many choices,


512
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,506
that choice overload,
it stresses you out.


513
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:17,816
And what you, people wind


514
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,276
up doing is avoiding making
a decision altogether.


515
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:24,236
And you want people to make a
decision to purchase something.


516
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,026
It's kind of like if you've
ever gone on to make a recipe


517
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:30,916
and it calls for apples.


518
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:34,326
Maybe you're making apple
pie and so you got your list.


519
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:36,786
You go to the grocery store and
then you're faced with this.


520
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,056
Well, what kind of apples?


521
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:42,806
Is it Golden Delicious
or Red Delicious


522
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:45,346
or Fuji or Pink Lady or oh!


523
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:46,536
It's too much!


524
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:47,756
It's overwhelming!


525
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:49,196
Too many apples!


526
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:53,006
And this will result in you just
abandoning that pie altogether.


527
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:56,736
You want to avoid that
reaction in your app.


528
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:01,076
Too many choices becomes
stressful and that's going


529
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:04,396
to result in people avoiding the
purchase decision altogether.


530
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:07,206
So here is Match.


531
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:09,976
It's a different
dating application.


532
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,996
Again, loads of utility
without subscription.


533
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,696
More than letting you
test-drive the app.


534
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:17,876
They're practically
giving you an entire car.


535
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:21,436
You can fill out your profile,
message people, a million ways


536
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,826
of browsing including
recommended partners.


537
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:28,466
They do offer some premium
features though and one


538
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:30,676
of the things is
seeing who's viewed me.


539
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:34,366
So tapping on that
viewed me button brings


540
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,836
up their subscription choices.


541
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:38,016
So they're offering
me that information


542
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,206
at the time that I need it.


543
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:43,236
Now look, I've got
3 easy choices here.


544
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:48,016
They've even highlighted
the one with the best value.


545
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,506
3 choices is an easy
decision to make.


546
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:55,496
I don't have to scroll through
a long list of options or page


547
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:56,926
through screen after screen


548
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:58,786
with different subscription
numbers on it.


549
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,696
Then I have to remember
them in my head


550
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:01,856
and try and figure it out.


551
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,806
That makes it hard.


552
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:06,056
Buying things shouldn't be hard.


553
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:11,626
So fewer things all on one
screen, no paging, no scrolling.


554
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:18,066
People want to be able to see
all their options at once.


555
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:23,046
Now, if someone's ready to
make that decision to buy,


556
00:26:23,046 --> 00:26:25,736
they're ready to press that
buy button, you really want


557
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:28,386
to execute on it as
efficiently as possible.


558
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:31,236
I mean, have you ever gone
to get a cup of coffee


559
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:34,436
and then you're faced with
a long, slow-moving line?


560
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:36,066
And so, you're just
like, "Forget it."


561
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,216
That's what you don't want to
happen in your app or game.


562
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:44,946
Minimizing both the time and the
number of steps that it takes


563
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:48,666
to make a purchase keeps people
really engaged in your app,


564
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,786
not thinking about that
purchasing process.


565
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:55,106
So this is Supernauts.


566
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:58,426
It's a builder game that
takes place in space.


567
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:02,006
It's not quite out worldwide
yet so stayed tuned very soon


568
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:03,756
because you're probably going
to want to play it after this.


569
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,336
Now right now, I'm
in the process


570
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:08,216
of repairing my tiki hut.


571
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,866
As you can see, it's a little
pathetic at the moment.


572
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,306
I want to add some more
timber but this is going


573
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:17,106
to cost me 8 diamonds.


574
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,596
Now, I only have 1.


575
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,816
So what happens when I
press that green button?


576
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:28,106
I can get some gems right here.


577
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,636
I don't have to go anywhere.


578
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:34,656
I can stay right in that
moment of tiki hut repair.


579
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:38,486
So in addition to clearly
stating what I'm going to get,


580
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:43,616
200 gems for $4.99, they're also
reminding me why I'm seeing this


581
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:44,466
in the first place.


582
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,736
I need 7 more.


583
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:47,446
I only have 1.


584
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:48,076
I needed 8.


585
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:50,706
And they've even
selected the package


586
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:53,036
of gems that's closest
to what I needed.


587
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:56,886
It happens that this is the
smallest package of gems


588
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,926
but then I can make a
decision really quickly.


589
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:02,066
I mean, yes, they have
a gem store and yes,


590
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,986
it has many more options in it.


591
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:08,406
But taking me away from my
tiki hut is more disruptive


592
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:11,926
than letting me just stay
put, stay focused on building


593
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:14,406
because building is
what I came here to do.


594
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,716
You never want to
distract a game player


595
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:18,966
from playing the game.


596
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:20,476
That's the fun part.


597
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:23,116
Distracting them makes
it easier for them


598
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:24,486
to just walk away entirely.


599
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:30,406
Similarly, Candy Crush Saga
handles this really well also.


600
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:34,286
You have those boosters at
the beginning of every level


601
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:37,746
and you have the option of
purchasing them right here.


602
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:40,706
They're not shipping
me off to a candy store


603
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:42,736
with a million different
things to choose from.


604
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,936
It's just, "Would you
like this booster?


605
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:45,796
Here's the price.


606
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,246
Buy it. Back in the game."


607
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:52,536
Fast and efficient, right at
the moment when I can use it.


608
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,916
Now another thing to think about
is preloading images and data


609
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,276
so it's there when
people need it.


610
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:00,416
This is the Bejeweled Blitz.


611
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,726
It's another kind of
match-3 puzzle game.


612
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,276
Now you earn coins
as you're playing


613
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:07,636
and then you use the
coins to buy rare gems


614
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,746
which then help you to do
better on the various puzzles.


615
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,976
Now every day, you can
also get some free coins


616
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:15,876
from this daily wheel.


617
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:20,466
Now you get 1 free spin
per day but of course,


618
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:23,476
you can buy some more
spins, if you like.


619
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,706
And the wheel's pretty generous.


620
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,626
So imagine that you're excited


621
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,006
and you're like,
"Okay, you know what?


622
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:31,016
I'm doing really good on
the tournament this week.


623
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,286
I want to beat my friends.


624
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:35,206
Let me go get some more
spins and see what happens."


625
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:38,126
Well, what if you're
faced with this?


626
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:40,566
People don't like waiting.


627
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:42,516
That's like that long
line at the coffee store.


628
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:44,946
You risk them not
sticking around.


629
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:50,006
Now thankfully, Bejeweled
Blitz doesn't do this.


630
00:29:50,276 --> 00:29:51,716
They load everything
immediately.


631
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:56,206
What you want to do is to be
aware of what people are likely


632
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,976
to purchase based on where
they are in your app or game.


633
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:02,776
And then you can look for times
to thoughtfully preload it


634
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:06,076
so that the data and the images
are available should someone


635
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:07,036
need it.


636
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:09,516
So this screen is
only accessible


637
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:11,136
from that wheel screen.


638
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:14,326
So this is a perfect opportunity
to preload those images


639
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:15,796
so then they'll be available.


640
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:20,056
The images and data will be
there when people seek it out.


641
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:24,536
And 1 final tip is you should
cache artwork appropriately


642
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:27,286
so it's not going to have
to load every single time


643
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:28,886
if it doesn't need to.


644
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,206
Now after lunch in this
room, we have a great session


645
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:35,466
about optimizing in-app
purchases with StoreKit


646
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:39,256
so I highly recommend you come
back after lunch and check it


647
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:41,356
out because there's
a lot of great tips


648
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:43,476
for avoiding common pitfalls.


649
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:49,296
Now finally, what you can do to
make the buying process easier


650
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:51,446
on people is to inspire people.


651
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,206
Someone may not want something


652
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:56,846
because they don't know what
the possibility of it is.


653
00:30:57,136 --> 00:31:00,036
They don't understand how a tool
or a feature could help them


654
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:05,236
or what they could
achieve with them.


655
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:08,126
Now, I'm not saying that
you want to turn everything


656
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:09,736
into an advertising experience.


657
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,286
Again, we're not
trying to be pushy.


658
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:12,506
But there's a lot of ways


659
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:16,686
that you can really naturally
illustrate how things can


660
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:18,636
be used.


661
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:21,836
Paper by Fifty Three
does this beautifully.


662
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:25,606
They've got this sample
journal that the staff has made


663
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:28,506
that shows off not only what
the tools are capable of


664
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:30,986
but also different ways
they could be used.


665
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,616
You know, maybe you
want a wireframe with it


666
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,496
or maybe you want to
make some artwork.


667
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,726
Now another thing they do
well is give suggestive titles


668
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:42,646
to the blank journals.


669
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:46,786
Maybe you hadn't considered
sketching or journaling


670
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:48,396
with this app but
now you're going to.


671
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:52,646
And they also have a
gallery of artwork created


672
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:55,176
by people using the
app, regular people.


673
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,306
And this gallery
shows off the variety


674
00:31:58,306 --> 00:32:02,146
of styles that's achievable,
what you can do with the tools


675
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,336
and also how the
app can be used.


676
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:09,116
I mean, you can make
some amazing artwork


677
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:11,786
but you also might want to use
it for architectural renderings.


678
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:16,686
And if that doesn't get you
inspired, maybe the idea


679
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,516
of having your work featured
here is very exciting.


680
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:24,026
So you've just got a plethora
of ways that you can use the app


681
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,616
and see what the
tools are capable of.


682
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:32,516
Now again, with games, and with
Supernauts does this very well,


683
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,846
it's kind of a different
approach with the same idea.


684
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:40,016
So after you learn the basic
game play with Supernauts,


685
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,546
they reward you for visiting
other people's worlds.


686
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:46,456
Now like I said, this is a
builder game so you're working


687
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,526
on building up your property.


688
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:52,046
And seeing how creative other
people have been is super


689
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,996
inspiring for your own place.


690
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,756
Now this is how you
start off, pretty basic.


691
00:32:57,836 --> 00:32:59,866
In the first 15 minutes,
you're going


692
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,796
to get some real basic
structures going.


693
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:04,886
And after a couple of hours,
you might wind up with something


694
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:09,096
like this or something
like my tiki hut.


695
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:12,046
And when you get through a
couple of hours, you think,


696
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,206
"Okay, I know what's going on.


697
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:15,306
I have an idea of
what's possible."


698
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,696
But it's only when you go


699
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:21,146
to visit other people's worlds
do you really get a sense


700
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,276
for what's coming, for
what can be created.


701
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:28,846
So check these out.


702
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:30,336
These are all real players.


703
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:34,686
This is not the Supernauts
crew who created these.


704
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:37,006
Amazing, right?


705
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:40,976
I mean, my tiki hut is
super lame by comparison.


706
00:33:41,516 --> 00:33:44,566
[ Laughter ]


707
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,936
And now I'm excited.


708
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:51,726
Now I want to go in and add a
dragon or you know, a rainbow


709
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:54,216
or a flag or messages
to my friends.


710
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:55,836
I mean, it makes,
it gets you excited


711
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:57,856
about spending more
time building things.


712
00:33:58,206 --> 00:33:59,386
You make something really cool


713
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:02,106
and you can see what materials
are still forthcoming.


714
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:07,146
So as you're thinking about how


715
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,646
to make the buying
process easier,


716
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:14,376
make sure that people can see
what's available with no effort.


717
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:18,686
Help people understand the
value of what you're offering.


718
00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:20,735
Give them that test
drive experience.


719
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,556
And then when it comes
to the transaction,


720
00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:29,286
make sure that you can process
on it fast and efficient.


721
00:34:29,286 --> 00:34:31,636
And don't forget to
get people excited


722
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,696
about what you're offering.


723
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:36,065
But the story doesn't end here.


724
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,886
Your job is not over
just getting them


725
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:39,076
to push the buy button.


726
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,266
There's a lot of things
that need to happen


727
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:44,716
to complete the transaction
in order to have it continue


728
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,505
to be a really great experience.


729
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:51,916
The first of which is a new
feature coming in the fall


730
00:34:51,996 --> 00:34:54,235
and Tim touched on
this very briefly,


731
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:57,045
but I'd like to spend a little
more time because this is going


732
00:34:57,045 --> 00:35:01,126
to impact everyone
and that's Ask to Buy.


733
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:05,186
So in the fall, you'll be able
to associate up to 6 people


734
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,556
in the household as a family.


735
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:08,666
And as part of this, we're going


736
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,986
to have a new parental
control called Ask to Buy.


737
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:14,556
And if it's enabled, this
means that a parent is going


738
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:18,076
to approve or decline any
purchases that a child makes.


739
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:20,836
So it's basically the
equivalent of this.


740
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:23,046
"Can I have it?


741
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,166
Please, please, please?"


742
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:27,306
But it's all going to
happen through your devices.


743
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,386
So here's how it works.


744
00:35:30,106 --> 00:35:34,606
Today, when your app sends a
request to purchase something,


745
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:37,986
you're going to get a
response right back.


746
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,456
That purchased or failed.


747
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:46,686
Now with Ask to Buy, we're going
to check with the parent first


748
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,036
if Ask to Buy is enabled.


749
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:50,156
So you're going to send
the request for purchasing.


750
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:51,916
The child's going to
ask for something.


751
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,336
And then the App Store is
going to check with the parent.


752
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,356
So what does that mean to you?


753
00:35:57,986 --> 00:35:59,926
During this time, you're going


754
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:01,966
to get a response
back of deferred.


755
00:36:02,466 --> 00:36:08,216
And then once the parent
accepts or declines the request,


756
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:11,686
that's when the App Store will
let you know whether it's been


757
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:12,686
purchased or failed.


758
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:18,636
And this deferred state can last
for up to 24 hours while waiting


759
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:19,916
for a response from the parent.


760
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,816
And if there's no
response within 24 hours,


761
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:25,886
it's going to default to failed
and the child can request again.


762
00:36:27,156 --> 00:36:29,876
So what does this mean
from a design perspective?


763
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:34,046
Well, if you have
modal situations


764
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:37,206
where people are doing
purchasing, you need to shift


765
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,226
over to an asynchronous model.


766
00:36:39,786 --> 00:36:43,566
Let's say your game offers
boosters at the beginning


767
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:46,156
of a level and a child
makes a request to buy one.


768
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:50,516
You don't want that child stuck
there waiting for up to 24 hours


769
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,616
to hear whether they
can have a booster


770
00:36:52,616 --> 00:36:53,786
for the next level, right?


771
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:56,486
I can guarantee you, they're not
going to stick around that long.


772
00:36:57,746 --> 00:36:59,206
So what can you do?


773
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:02,156
Well, you have to figure
what's going to be best


774
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:03,766
for your app or your game.


775
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,036
The important thing is that
you let people keep using


776
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:08,926
and enjoying your
app during this time.


777
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,876
So if a child's requested
a booster,


778
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,746
well you send the request
off for the parent to approve


779
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,406
but then you could let
them play other levels


780
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,466
or maybe they continue
playing the level


781
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:22,746
but without the booster and
when that approval comes in,


782
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:25,536
you bank it and let them
use it at a different time.


783
00:37:26,676 --> 00:37:29,746
Another thing that you want to
think about is giving some sort


784
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,116
of feedback inside
of the application


785
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:35,506
so that the child remembers
that something is pending,


786
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:37,466
that they've already
asked Mom and Dad.


787
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:41,846
And so that you could update
the label on the button


788
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:46,426
to say something else or in the
App Store, we show a message


789
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:48,926
to help the child remember
that it's actually pending.


790
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:53,266
So if any people using
your app are under 18,


791
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:55,956
you need to start
preparing for this now.


792
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,676
That deferred state is
entirely new and you need


793
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:01,416
to make sure you're
handling it well.


794
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:05,156
Make sure people can still
continue to use your app


795
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:07,906
or your game while that
deferred state is happening.


796
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:14,436
And you want to make sure
that if a response is pending,


797
00:38:14,436 --> 00:38:15,906
that they have some
feedback there.


798
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:20,586
It's really important to note
that this isn't just iOS 8.


799
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:24,056
So don't think that waiting to
update your app or game is going


800
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,956
to get you out of this
because it's not going to.


801
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:30,646
The ability to create families
is what's coming with iOS 8


802
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:34,566
but this Ask to Buy
permission is going to apply


803
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:38,876
to older versions of
iOS, Mac OS and Apple TV,


804
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:42,836
so start preparing now.


805
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,366
Now, whether or not a
transaction completes


806
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:49,386
immediately or up to 24
hours later, you always want


807
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:52,026
to confirm that that
transaction is completed.


808
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:52,626
Let people know.


809
00:38:53,936 --> 00:38:57,736
So at a minimum, help people
find whatever they just bought.


810
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:59,916
Let them know that
it's available for use.


811
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:03,806
An example that you guys
probably see all the time is the


812
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:04,666
App Store.


813
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,016
So as soon as you confirm
payment for an application,


814
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,566
you see that the app
starts to download.


815
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,816
You get that feedback that
something's happening.


816
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:14,756
Nothing's gone wrong.


817
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:17,096
Your merchandise is
being transferred to you.


818
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:21,606
And then you can open that app
directly from the App Store.


819
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:22,566
You don't have to go digging


820
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:25,176
around all your home screens
filled with apps to find it.


821
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:29,656
You can just start playing
3's right there for hours.


822
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:33,706
Now, another thing to think
about is if you have a game


823
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:36,066
or a children's app,
something really fun,


824
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:37,936
you can make this
a fun experience


825
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:39,856
by using sound and animation.


826
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:42,076
So this is Heads Up!


827
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:45,666
It's a game that's really
popular with Ellen DeGeneres.


828
00:39:45,956 --> 00:39:48,286
She plays it on her
TV show all the time.


829
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:49,956
It's a little bit like Charades.


830
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:53,226
It's designed to play it with
real people in real life.


831
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:57,576
Each of this deck of theme cards
are topics that you then act


832
00:39:57,576 --> 00:39:58,976
out for your friends
and try and guess.


833
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,266
Now they give you a
couple of theme packs


834
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,886
to get going to start playing.


835
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:08,986
But then they also offer
a ton of other theme packs


836
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:10,386
to enhance the experience.


837
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,486
So check out what happens
when you buy one of these.


838
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:14,976
I happen to be into
the 80's one.


839
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,181
[ Music ]


840
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:26,786
So you get that sound
and that animation


841
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:28,576
that lets you know
something has happened.


842
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:31,476
The purchase has gone through
and then they animate back


843
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:34,416
up to the top so you can
see where your cards are


844
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:39,146
and start playing right away.


845
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:45,306
Now confirming that the
transaction is completed is


846
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:47,156
especially important
with Ask to Buy


847
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:50,846
because your customer may
not be at the same place


848
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:53,056
where they were when they
requested the transaction,


849
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:53,406
right?


850
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,496
So if you had a comic app


851
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,116
and say the child is
browsing all the comics


852
00:40:59,116 --> 00:41:02,686
that are available, they request
one and while they're waiting


853
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:06,746
for Mom or Dad to accept it,
well then they go and read one


854
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:07,806
of the issues they already have.


855
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:12,426
So you need to think about if
that transaction completes,


856
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:15,866
how are you going to let
people know if it completes


857
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,706
at a later time how you're
going to let people know


858
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:23,566
where their merchandise
is and how to find it.


859
00:41:23,836 --> 00:41:27,146
Now no one wants to see
Error Code 128, right?


860
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:29,676
It's confusing.


861
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:33,196
It's frustrating to someone and
it can be a little alarming.


862
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:37,216
So you want to know your error
codes and present information


863
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:38,696
in a way that's going
to be meaningful


864
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,326
to the people using your apps.


865
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:43,836
Not all errors may
require a response.


866
00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:46,056
You don't have to tell
your people everything.


867
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:50,256
Now if someone did
cancel a transaction,


868
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:51,896
let's say that you're
using an app or game,


869
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:53,116
you change your mind
about something.


870
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:53,836
You cancel it.


871
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:55,706
Is this what you want to see?


872
00:41:56,356 --> 00:41:57,356
This doesn't make sense.


873
00:41:57,996 --> 00:42:00,016
You may not need to
notify people at all


874
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:02,426
or you may just want to
make this a little more


875
00:42:02,636 --> 00:42:03,426
customer friendly.


876
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:07,816
So the best experience,
of course,


877
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,726
is to avoid errors entirely.


878
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,616
So again, this afternoon's
session


879
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,216
on optimizing StoreKit is going
to have a ton of technical tips


880
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:18,546
about avoiding errors and
all those common pitfalls.


881
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:25,246
Now another thing that I see
sometimes is that people tend


882
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:26,926
to over ask for purchases.


883
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:30,486
You want to let folks
get some enjoyment


884
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:33,006
out of what they just bought
before you start asking them


885
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:33,916
to buy something again.


886
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:36,456
Again, don't be this guy.


887
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:41,276
It's like at Christmas,
so you unwrap the toy


888
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:44,446
and you're all excited
and then you realize, "Oh,


889
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,506
it didn't come with
any batteries!"


890
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:49,186
It's disappointing right?


891
00:42:49,186 --> 00:42:50,656
I mean, you just took something


892
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:53,426
that was a really joyous
occasion and turned it


893
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:55,546
into a frustrating
experience for people.


894
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:58,686
So make sure that when
someone buys something,


895
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,366
they can use what
they just bought.


896
00:43:00,906 --> 00:43:02,606
Give them that satisfaction.


897
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:05,276
They shouldn't have to
make a subsequent purchase


898
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:06,976
in order to enjoy it.


899
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:13,096
And then like I said
earlier, less is more.


900
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:16,056
You want to prioritize
the remaining purchases.


901
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:20,076
Help people focus on what's
still available to them.


902
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:22,956
If there's things they
can't buy, do prioritize


903
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:26,086
that in the UI, especially
with nonconsumables.


904
00:43:26,206 --> 00:43:28,346
There is no need to keep
showing people something


905
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:29,236
that they've already bought.


906
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,726
They already own it.


907
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:35,356
Now in some cases, it may
not make sense to hide items


908
00:43:35,356 --> 00:43:36,576
that have already been purchased


909
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:42,636
but just don't let them
be the star of the show.


910
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:45,956
And I think you're all aware
that it's very important


911
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,336
that you let people
restore their purchases


912
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,406
that they've made previously.


913
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:52,776
They could have made
it on another device


914
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:57,036
or they got a new piece of
hardware and it's important


915
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:58,616
that they can retrieve what
they've already bought.


916
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:03,436
This is "Brooklyn Magazine"
and they make it super easy.


917
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,276
If you already have
a subscription,


918
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,276
well here's where to go to
start that restore process.


919
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:11,456
But they took it
one step further.


920
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,636
So if you were to tap on one
of these subscription options,


921
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,376
you get the confirmation
to subscribe just


922
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:19,306
like you would expect.


923
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:24,916
But if you hit Cancel, they ask
if you're already a subscriber.


924
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:29,156
And that's because there's
basically 2 reasons why you


925
00:44:29,156 --> 00:44:31,426
might cancel subscription
confirmation.


926
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:35,846
One is if you changed your mind
about subscribing, of course.


927
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,686
And that's a much bigger
problem for them to tackle.


928
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:42,006
But the other is if you
already had a subscription.


929
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:46,946
So in this case, they're
helping get you back on track.


930
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:49,306
Now you all know it's
an App Store requirement


931
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,766
to make restoring available.


932
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,596
But a great experience
is going to make it easy.


933
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:59,146
All right, so one last
tip in this section.


934
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:01,516
And this is about notifications.


935
00:45:02,206 --> 00:45:05,746
You want to use them
thoughtfully and this applies


936
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:09,086
to push notifications as
well as local notifications.


937
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:13,036
Now you're not going to have
to notify children about Ask


938
00:45:13,226 --> 00:45:16,026
to Buy, purchases completing
because the App Store is going


939
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:17,006
to handle that for you.


940
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:20,746
But you do want to use
notifications to let people know


941
00:45:20,746 --> 00:45:24,436
about new content for
a subscription or maybe


942
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:26,376
in those dating apps,
they could let me know


943
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:28,656
if I have new recommended
matches.


944
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:33,196
Circa does a great job
with their notifications.


945
00:45:33,616 --> 00:45:36,336
They serve up bite-sized
news articles


946
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:38,566
and they give you
updates as it's happening.


947
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:42,436
Now they're only going to send
notification if it's an article


948
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:45,446
that I explicitly followed
or if it's something


949
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:46,986
that they consider
breaking news.


950
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:49,916
And they're very choosy


951
00:45:50,336 --> 00:45:52,076
about what they consider
breaking news.


952
00:45:52,506 --> 00:45:54,906
Now this is not breaking news.


953
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,486
This is what I followed earlier.


954
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,006
Swiping on that notification
takes you directly


955
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:01,956
to the article so you
can read all about it.


956
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:05,096
So they've made it really easy
for me to return to the content.


957
00:46:05,156 --> 00:46:10,186
So you want to be really
thoughtful about the kind


958
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:13,126
and the number of notifications
that you're sending


959
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:15,856
because too many
notifications is just going


960
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,106
to annoy everybody.


961
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:20,406
And not only do you risk them
turning off notifications


962
00:46:20,406 --> 00:46:23,566
entirely, they might just
wind up deleting your app,


963
00:46:23,566 --> 00:46:25,456
if they get tired of
all the notifications.


964
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:28,806
That's not the experience
that we're after, right?


965
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:30,876
You want thoughtful
notifications


966
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:32,896
that will keep people
coming back


967
00:46:33,716 --> 00:46:35,566
and make the app
feel more valuable


968
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:40,236
because suddenly there's
new content there.


969
00:46:40,536 --> 00:46:43,116
Okay, so make sure that
you consider these things


970
00:46:43,986 --> 00:46:46,156
after your customer's
pressed the buy button.


971
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,766
Completing the transaction
is super important.


972
00:46:49,296 --> 00:46:53,266
Which brings us to the
final sort of stage


973
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:55,296
of a great experience
with in-app purchases


974
00:46:55,296 --> 00:46:58,256
and that's measuring
and refining.


975
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:02,046
With all good design, it's
so important to iterate,


976
00:47:02,476 --> 00:47:05,056
you want to measure the
success and quite frankly,


977
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,126
the failures of what you tried.


978
00:47:07,626 --> 00:47:09,676
See how that has
an effect on things


979
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:12,546
and then make changes
based on those.


980
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:16,276
I mean, that all the things
that I mentioned today are going


981
00:47:16,276 --> 00:47:19,096
to work for all product
types and all audiences.


982
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:22,816
So the more that you really fine
tune your approach, the better,


983
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:26,036
the more effective
it's going to be.


984
00:47:26,036 --> 00:47:28,756
So here are some questions
that you can ask yourself


985
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,706
about the changes that you made


986
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:32,846
to help determine whether
they were successful.


987
00:47:33,756 --> 00:47:36,646
So when were the changes
made and what were they?


988
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:40,246
Super important, you want
to make a detailed note


989
00:47:40,246 --> 00:47:43,196
about exactly when you made
changes and all the things


990
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:44,616
that you updated so
you have something


991
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:45,776
to measure against later.


992
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,856
You also want to think about
how has the number of changes,


993
00:47:51,096 --> 00:47:52,866
how has the number
of purchases changed?


994
00:47:54,006 --> 00:47:55,426
Hopefully they've
gone up, right?


995
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,626
And are different things being
purchased from different places


996
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:03,646
in the application as a result
of integrating your merchandise?


997
00:48:04,116 --> 00:48:05,966
Are you selling higher
value items?


998
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,686
And what's the average
revenue per device?


999
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:13,116
And this is going to be
really easy to see in the fall


1000
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:15,646
with the new iTunes Connect
because we have a ton


1001
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:18,786
of app analytics coming
for you all for free.


1002
00:48:18,786 --> 00:48:20,896
And this helps you learn whether


1003
00:48:20,896 --> 00:48:23,016
or not a marketing
campaign was worth it.


1004
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:26,466
If you invested a certain
amount of money per device


1005
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:29,426
and you're not seeing that
revenue come back in, well,


1006
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:32,976
that campaign's not going to
be a good investment for you.


1007
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,716
And finally, keep an eye out.


1008
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:38,126
Are people returning
more frequently?


1009
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:41,406
Because if they are,
that's an indication


1010
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:44,826
that you have a really great
experience, that the quality


1011
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:48,306
of the experience has gone up.


1012
00:48:49,146 --> 00:48:53,216
So I hope that you guys
will take at least one


1013
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:56,676
of the design tips that I gave
you today and implement it


1014
00:48:56,676 --> 00:49:00,606
in your app or game and
then see how it affects the


1015
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:01,806
overall experience.


1016
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:03,106
Because I think you're going


1017
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,076
to be really happy
with the results.


1018
00:49:05,796 --> 00:49:08,726
And I would like to
hear how it goes.


1019
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:10,026
This is my email address.


1020
00:49:11,176 --> 00:49:12,016
So let me know.


1021
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:13,616
Let me know what you changed.


1022
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:16,276
Let me know the effects that
it's having on your sales.


1023
00:49:17,216 --> 00:49:20,026
And if you would like more
design advice, we have tons


1024
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:24,256
of it at Designing Great Apps
up at developer.apple.com.


1025
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,726
And if you don't all have a copy


1026
00:49:26,726 --> 00:49:28,526
of the Human Interface
Guidelines,


1027
00:49:28,726 --> 00:49:31,276
it's a great resource,
a lot of good tips.


1028
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:33,216
It's available on
the iBooks Store now.


1029
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:38,216
So here are all the related
sessions you might want to see.


1030
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:41,076
Ingredients of Great Games
was yesterday and that talks


1031
00:49:41,076 --> 00:49:44,316
about how to have a really
great gaming experience.


1032
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:47,556
And so the video should
be available online


1033
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:48,436
and you can watch it.


1034
00:49:48,976 --> 00:49:51,646
And just before the session
was the new iTunes Connect


1035
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:54,626
which had all the information
about app analytics.


1036
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,806
So look for that video
to be out later today.


1037
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:02,086
And then we have our Optimizing
In-App Purchases later today


1038
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,876
in this room, tons of
great technical tips.


1039
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:10,606
And there's a prototyping
session tomorrow morning that's


1040
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:13,426
going to tell you all about
how to quickly iterate and test


1041
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:16,756
out the value and it's a great
session to figure out how


1042
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:19,286
to quickly test things
out that you might want


1043
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:21,026
to integrate into your app.


1044
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,396
And finally, on Friday, come


1045
00:50:24,496 --> 00:50:27,216
to Preventing Unauthorized
Purchases with Receipts


1046
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:30,356
because you're offering
really valuable things


1047
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:32,136
and we only want you
to be giving them


1048
00:50:32,136 --> 00:50:33,276
to people who've paid for them.


1049
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:37,866
So it's going to be a very
detailed technical heavy session


1050
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,086
that you'll want to check out.


1051
00:50:39,976 --> 00:50:41,426
So thanks so much everybody!


1052
00:50:41,426 --> 00:50:42,736
Enjoy the rest of
the conference.


1053
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:48,980
