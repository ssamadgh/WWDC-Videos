Before we start with
the keynote,

10
00:00:55,054 --> 00:01:01,024
we'd like to take a moment
to talk about the tragedy

11
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:04,926
that occurred yesterday
in Orlando, Florida.

12
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,530
We offer our deepest sympathies

13
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:14,304
to everyone whose lives were
touched by this violence.

14
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:20,816
It was senseless, unconscionable
act of terrorism and hate,

15
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:25,113
aimed at dividing
and destroying.

16
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:32,027
The Apple community is
made up of people from all

17
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:36,294
around the world, from
all different backgrounds

18
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:39,295
and all different
points of view.

19
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:43,068
We celebrate our diversity.

20
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:47,238
We know that it makes
us stronger

21
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,139
and moves everyone forward.

Please rise and join us
in a moment of silence

23

the people who loved them.

Hello and welcome to WWDC 2016.

It's great to be here at the
legendary Bill Graham Auditorium

28
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,433

jam-packed morning planned

for you, and we couldn't
be more excited.

00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,776
Let me give you some details
on the conference this year.

32
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:58,342
This is our 27th Worldwide
Developers Conference.

33
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,114
The developer community has
never been more vibrant.

34
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:05,784
We now have 13 million
registered developers

35
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:09,454
with 2 million added
in the last year alone.

36
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:15,995
The conference this year
sold out over 5000 attendees

37
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,795
and millions more watching
on the live stream.

38
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:23,198
This is truly a worldwide
conference.

39
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:28,742
We have people here
from over 74 countries.

40
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,212
We're excited that
we're attracting

41
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,881
so many new developers.

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,280
Over 70% of the attendees

Now, we're investing in the
next generation of developers.

The youngest, the
youngest is only nine.

00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,871
Wow. I met her yesterday
and she is going

54
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,866
to make one heck of
a great developer.

55
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,978
This week is about
helping you get the most

56
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,517
out of our platforms.

57
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:43,352
So we have over 100
engineering-led sessions

58
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:49,619
and over 150 hands-on labs
with over 1000 Apple engineers

59
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:52,891
on site here to help
you through the week.

60
00:04:52,891 --> 00:05:00,061
The App Store started eight
years ago with only 500 apps.

61
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:05,875
Recently, we passed
a major milestone.

62
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:11,481
We now have 2 million
apps on the App Store.

64
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:25,326
Your 2 million apps had been
downloaded 130 billion times.

65
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:33,236
And as you know, the App Store
is the best business opportunity

66
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,772
for developers.

67
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:40,877
We're about to pass $50 billion
paid directly to developers.

68
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,413
This is absolutely amazing.

69
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:50,347
And of course, successful
developers translates

70
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,019
to us having the best apps
on our platform for users

71
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,359
and this is what really matters.

72
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,095
Now, we have a busy
morning planned but I'd

73
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,661
like to take a moment to talk

74
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,360
about why we do what
we do at Apple.

75
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:12,173
Our north star has always been
about improving people's lives

76
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,141
by creating great products
that change the world.

77
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:19,781
And we've been doing
this for a long time.

78
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:25,448
But today, for the very first
time, we're going to talk to you

79
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,391
about four Apple platforms.

80
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:34,598
Each of these platforms
is category-defining

81
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,993
and world-changing.

82
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:41,705
The Macintosh changed
personal computing.

83
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,140
Today, it's the most innovative

84
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:47,436
and loved personal
computer on the planet.

85
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,109
iPhone changed phones forever.

86
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:55,219
It's the best smartphone
experience and the gold standard

87
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:58,184
by which everything
else is measured.

88
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:03,993
The iPad magically transforms
a glass canvas into anything

89
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,859
that you want it to be.

90
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,558
It's our clearest
expression of the future

91
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,130

92
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,099
Apple Watch, only one year old,

93
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,640
it's already the ultimate
device for a healthy life.

94
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:25,148
And Apple TV just announced
last fall based on the idea

95
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:28,113
that the future of TV is apps,

96
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:32,583
it's already transforming the
biggest screen in our homes.

97
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:36,824
Now, we love creating
great apps,

98
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:40,822
we love creating great
products that change the world,

99
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:44,726
but we can't do it alone.

100
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,070
Developers are a crucial
part of that journey.

101
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:54,607
You are about-- You are a
part of everything that we do,

102
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:58,046

will do going forward.

Because it's together that
we enrich people's lives.

Now, we offer you four
incredible platforms

105

that power these world-changing
product experiences.

107
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:24,672
We're going to move each of
these platforms forward today

108
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,310
and we'd like to get
started with watchOS.

109
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,047
And to do that, I'd like
to invite Kevin Lynch up.

Thank you, Tim.

113
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,091
So I am really excited to
talk with you about watchOS

114
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,630
and show you some
of what's ahead.

115
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,225
Now, people who are using Apple
Watch love it, particularly

116
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:53,698
for quick glances at information
and quick interactions.

117
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,839
And our top focus is performance
and we've made optimizations

118
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:00,205
across the entire system
including a serious acceleration

119
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,045
in app launch time.

120
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,440
Your app should actually
respond instantly.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

122
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,017
The information you look

123
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:11,785
at should be updated
before you go look,

124
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:14,283
so it's ready the instant that
you are so you're not waiting.

125
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:18,786
In watchOS 3, your favorite
apps can respond instantly.

126
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,130
So let's take a look.

127
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,565
So we're going to
accomplish this

128
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,200
by keeping your favorite
apps in memory.

129
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,495
We're going to support
background updates of data

130
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,697
and refresh the information
so it's ready the instant

131
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,669
that you are, and then we
support quickly launching these

132
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:31,939
apps and interacting with them.

133
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:34,607
This is going to work for
both the built-in apps

134
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,776
and third-party apps.

135
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,745
Let's take a look at an example.

136
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,284
This is watchOS 2 and
we're going to look

137
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,679
at an app called Onefootball.

138
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,621
We're going to launch it from
the complication the bottom left

139
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:47,456
and we're going to
see how long it takes.

140
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,392
So here we are launching
the app, takes a few seconds

141
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,159
to launch, and then once it
launches, it loads some data,

142
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,558
and it updates, there we go.

143
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,200
So that is a pretty typical
example of watchOS 2.

144
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,197
Now, we're going to take a look

145
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:03,168
at Onefootball launching
in watchOS 3.

146
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,308
Are you guys ready?

147
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:07,573
OK, don't blink.

148
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,512
That's it.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

150
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,482
So that example is about seven
times faster but it feels

00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:22,254
like a million times faster.

152
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,324
So now, we've made
it really easy

153
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,361
to access your favorite apps.

154
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:27,627
You can just press the
side button below the crown

155
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,396
to show what we call the dock.

156
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,964
You can choose which
apps go here

157
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:33,532
and you can quickly
scroll through them.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

159
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,469
The apps are now both glanceable
and interactive rather

160
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,072
than separate concepts.

161
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,204
This is a dramatic improvement

162
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,308
in how it feels to
use the watch.

163
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,480
So this increased performance
allowed us to have access

164
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,979
to our favorite apps quickly.

165
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,450
We want to be able to
access them anywhere.

166
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,820
So by using the side button,
we can get to them easily.

167
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,089
Now, another key
design goal we had was

168
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,228
to make the watch
feel more familiar.

169
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,523
And so we've done
with the watch face,

170
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:01,625
now we've added control center.

171
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:02,866
You just swipe up
from the bottom,

00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,835
So this is a giant improvement
at how it feels to use apps

175
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:17,278
and to navigate the watch very
simply and easily in watchOS 3.

176
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:20,045
Now, we've also made it more
powerful to reply to messages.

177
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:23,445
So now, when you receive a
message, you can see the ways

178
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:24,318
to respond right there.

179
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,446
We've removed this step.

180
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,590
You don't have to
actually press reply now.

181
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,015
You can just pick the
way you'd like to reply.

182
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,689
And if you just scroll down,

183
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,958
you'll see your smart replies
right below the message.

184
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,657
So you can just tap reply
in less than a second.

185
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,060
Now sometimes, you don't see
exactly the response you like

186
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:41,263
and you're not in a situation
where you can use dictation,

187
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,466
so wouldn't it be great

188
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,207
if you can just write
your message on the watch?

189
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,972
Well, we're introducing a new
way to do that with something

190
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,272
that we call Scribble.

191
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:51,074
With Scribble, you have
a new way to respond just

192
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,646
by writing what you
like on the screen,

193
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,214
and you can just
quickly draw the letters

194
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,682
for your message right there

195
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,620
like writing something
like Starbucks.

196
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,486
You can see the letters go
right on top of each other.

197

[ Cheering and Applause ]

198
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,129
So that's a great new way to
respond with just the response

199
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,598
that you like on your watch.

200
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,866
Now, the watch face is
great for quick looks

201
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,206
and it reflects your style

202
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,671
and it's also the
character of the device.

203
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,969
Now, we've had Mickey as a fun
watch face that I like to use

204
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:23,872
on weekends but I know what my
daughter is going to really love

205
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,045
because Minnie is
coming to the watch now.

206
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,315
And of course, you can choose
from a variety of colors

207
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:35,257
for her outfit that match
her bands perfectly.

208
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,795
Now, one of the most frequent
things people do is look

209
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,930
at their activity rings

210
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,895
and we're adding a new
watch face specifically

211
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,963
for that called Activity, so
it's a great beautiful way

212
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,303
to see your rings
throughout the day.

213
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,572
It comes not only in
the analog version

214
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,471
but also a really nice
chronograph version

215
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,472
and a digital version, so a
super good way for looking

216
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,445
at your progress during the day.

217
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:02,184
We've also added a really simple
new face that we call Numerals,

218
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,480
which is very beautiful,
and the hours actually go

219
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,523
around the dial during day, and
you can choose from a variety

220
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,290
of fonts that match your style,

221
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,788
so a really simple new
watch face called Numerals.

222
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,531
Now, there's a lot of
watch faces to choose from

223
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,527
and we're finding that
people are actually switching

224
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,229
between faces for different
occasions, so we're going

225
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,032
to make that super easy.

226
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:25,433
You can now just swipe to switch
the face you'd like to use,

227
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,037
and you can choose
which faces you'd like

228
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:30,038
and how they're configured so
you can easily get to them.

229
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,211
We've also added the ability to
add more complications to faces

230
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,351
like Weather here
on the photo's face.

231
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,317
So now, really simple
to navigate

232
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:39,355
and use your watch
faces as well.

233

stuff running live.

I could not be more excited
to have the opportunity

240
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,004
to show you watchOS 3 today.

241
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,403
I wake up to my favorite
new face,

242
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:04,606
just the girl I've
been looking for.

243
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:07,809
Now, in watchOS 3, you
have a place to keep all

244
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,212
of your favorite apps.

245
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,584
You choose which apps go in your
dock and you choose the order.

246
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,353
I can bring up my dock by
pressing the side button.

247
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:17,752
And I can swipe through my apps
one at a time or lay my finger

248
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,996
down in these dots at the
bottom of the screen and fly

249

through my dock to
get to any app.

250
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,160
And the apps in my
dock are live,

251
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:27,363
so I can get a quick
glance at information

252
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,465
without even launching an
app like how close I am

253
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,807
to closing my activity rings.

254
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:33,943
And the apps have been
redesigned to put me

255
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,109
within one tap of the
thing I most want to do.

256

at the Timer app.

One tap to launch it and it's
right there waiting for me.

258
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:46,213
I can still set a custom timer
if that's what I want to do,

259
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,357
but the most common choices

260
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,522
for a timer are right
here on the screen.

261
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,121
So with one tap, I can
set a 10-minute timer

262
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:55,463
and get right back
to what I was doing.

263
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,100
Even my favorite apps from the
App Store can be in my dock

and they are lightning fast too.

00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:35,845
Now, after sending the message,

341
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,287
your watch will actually
now show your medical ID

342
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,883
which is also a new
feature in watchOS.

343
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,555
It has things like for
example your age and allergies

344
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,725
and other information
you'd like to put there.

345
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,563
And SOS works not
only just in the US

346
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,200
but it works internationally.

347
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,565
So for example you might
be traveling to some place

348
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,664
like Hong Kong and you might not
know what the emergency number

349
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,507
is to call but your
Apple Watch does.

350
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:05,743
[ Applause ]

351
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,983
So in this case, it calls
999 rather than 911.

352
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,250
So this is an emergency
feature that isn't one

353
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,149
that you'll use often
but when you need it,

354
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,991
it's going to be
there and that's SOS.

355
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:19,756
Now, one of the primary reasons
people are wearing the watch

356
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:20,957
today is for fitness and health.

357
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,459
And we're enhancing the
activity and workout apps

358
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:26,361
and we're adding a new app that
we think you're going to love.

359
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:29,464
Take a look at this,
please welcome Jay Blahnik.

360

[ Cheering and Applause ]

361
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:32,840
Thanks, Kevin.

362
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,277
Thank you.

363
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,815
So we know that one
of the most popular apps

364
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,981
in the Apple Watch
is the Activity app.

365
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,820
And as Kevin and
Stacey have mentioned,

366
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,585
many people have told us that
they actually become more active

367
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:49,984
because they become addicted
to closing the activity rings.

368
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,188
And we love hearing that.

369
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:54,189
But we also know that
many people are motivated

370
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,632
by other things.

371
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,567
Some people are motivated
by getting support

372
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,132
from their family and friends.

373
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,200
And if you're like
me, you're motivated

374
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,999
by good old fashion competition
and we wanted to make

375
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,042
that possible as well.

376
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:10,237
So with watchOS, we're
introducing activity sharing.

377
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,741
And it couldn't be simpler.

378
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,643
All you have to do
is swipe to the right

379
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,485
of your own activity rings

380
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,380
and there you'll see
your selected family

381
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,752
and friend's rings as well.

382
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,890
Now you can sort by whatever
metric is most important to you.

383
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,987
So you can sort by steps,
you can sort by workouts,

384
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,060
you can even sort
by exercise minutes.

385
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,329
Here you'll see that I've sorted
by the move ring and I'm right

386
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,729
where you'd expect me to be.

387
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,070
I'm getting by butt kicked by
Stacey but I'm annihilating Jeff

388
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:40,208
which makes me very happy.

389
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:43,344
If you want to see more details,
all you do is tap on anyone

390
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:46,081
on your activity list and
you'll get an up close look

391
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:49,177
at their activity rings,
but you can also see things

392
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,720
like their daily step count

393
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:54,485
and their workouts even
from third parties.

394
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:56,885
But one of my favorite
features is

395
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,958
that you can communicate
directly with the people

396
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,756
that you're sharing
activity with right

397
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:03,698
in the Activity app
through messages.

398
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,735
And when you do, you'll get
smart replies that are geared

399
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,971
around fitness and activity.

400
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:13,336
Some are supportive, some
are a little more competitive

401
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,038
but you can also
do some fun things.

402
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,639
For example, at the
end of a workout,

403
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,211
you could send your
raising heart rate to one

404
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,579
of your activity friends.

405
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:25,947
Or your raising heart rate to
one of your activity friends

406
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,050
or you can also send smack
talk in your own voice right

407
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,824
through audio messages.

408
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,623
So we think this is going
to be a great way for you

409
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,494
and your friends
to stay motivated

410
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:40,163
to keep each other active and
we can't wait for you to try it.

411
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:43,264
Now, our team has been
working hard to enable features

412
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,637
that would allow more people

413
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,205
to use the Activity
and Workout apps.

414
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,675
And one group we've
been thinking a lot

415
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,613
about is wheelchair users.

416
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,609
Now, many wheelchair users
already have an Apple Watch.

417
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,112
And they've witnessed and
told us that they love it

418
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,215
because it gives them
instant access to messages

419
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,887
and notifications
right from their wrist.

420
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,955
And this is particularly
important

421
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,694
because many wheelchair
users have

422
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:08,229
to tuck away their iPhone
securely throughout the day.

423
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:11,066
But to do a great activity
and workout experience,

424
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,532
we also recognize that we
couldn't just use the same

425
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,931
algorithms that we've used
for non-wheelchair users

426
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:19,303
because the biomechanics
are completely different.

427
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:22,243
For example, many wheelchair
users use a semicircular

428
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,210
technique when they're pushing
their wheelchair throughout

429
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,548
the day.

430
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:28,683
But as the terrain changes
and the speed changes,

431
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,619
they may switch to
an arc technique

432
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,685
or a single-loop over technique.

433
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:34,283
And this is what
makes it complicated.

434
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,325
These are only a few of the
techniques that they may use.

435
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:40,561
We knew that to do this right,
we not only have to do a lot

436
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,758
of studies but we
would also need

437
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,030
to enlist the help of experts.

438
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:47,529
So, we worked with the
Challenged Athletes Foundation

439
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,172
and the Lakeshore Foundation.

440
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,807
These are two of the
world's largest organizations

441
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,043
that are dedicated to
promoting physical fitness

442
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:56,138
for people in wheelchairs.

443
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,040
With their help, we were
able to conduct the studies.

444
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,883
And we were able to do
it on a wide variety

445
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,918
of wheelchair users
including some veterans.

446
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:07,285
And now, wheelchair users
will have a setting.

447
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:11,485
The time to stand notifications
will be changed to time to roll.

in the workout apps specifically
dedicated to wheelchair users

451
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,836
and of course the activity
rings will be optimized

452
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,706
for wheelchair pushes.

453
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:29,304
We could not be more
excited about this feature

454
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,147
and we're incredibly
thankful to our partners

455
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,512

[ Applause ]

457
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,550
Now, one of the things that
we've learned about health

458
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:43,392
in Apple Watch is
that simple things

459
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:45,887
like the activity rings
can be very powerful

460
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,160
at helping people
change behavior.

461
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,999
But we also know that
there's a lot more

462
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:52,064
to health than just fitness.

463
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,733
And we've been thinking
way beyond that.

464
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:57,872
So with watchOS, we're
launching a brand new app

465
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,669
for health, it's called Breathe.

466
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,371
And it's designed to guide you

467
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,643
through simple deep
breathing sessions

468
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:08,012
that can help you quiet
your mind, relax your body

469
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:11,882
and just better deal
with everyday stress.

470
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,953
Now, yoga practitioners have
been using deep breathing

471
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:17,452
exercises for thousands
of years as a way

472
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,955
to positively impact
the body and mind.

473
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:22,957
But the medical community has
also embraced deep breathing

474
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,430
as a great way to
improve daily health.

475
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,669
Dr. Deepak Chopra, one
of the early advocates

476
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:32,036
of body-mind medicine has said,
"Taking a moment every day

477
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,676
to do some deep breathing
can reduce stress,

478
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,342
calm the body-mind as well

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,580
as have a long term
health benefits."

480
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:41,916
Now to get to the
app, it's easy.

481
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,283
You can launch it from your
watch face, you can launch it

482
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:48,452
from the dock or like
the stand reminders,

483
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:51,552
you can actually set smart
notifications to remind you

484
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,896
and start building this as
a habit every single day.

485
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,893
When you open the app, you
can easily change the amount

486
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:00,296
of time you want
to do your session,

487
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,768
from one to five minutes just
by turning the digital crown.

488
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,839
And when you're in the app
experience, you'll be guided

489
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:11,208
by beautiful visuals that make
it really easy to follow along.

490
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:14,048
And if you prefer to do
this with your eyes closed,

491
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,045
you can turn on the
haptic feedback

492
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,717
and gentle taps will guide you

493
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:21,116
and you can do without
even looking.

494
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:23,818
When the session is over,
you'll get a summary.

495
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:26,121
And you'll also get your heart
rate from the last few seconds

496
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:28,223
of the session you just did.

497
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:30,425
Now if you already
do deep breathing,

498
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,268
we think this is going to be
a great way for you to fit it

499
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:33,963
into your day more often.

500
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,905
But for those of you that
don't, we think this is going

501
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,970
to be a great way to get started
and just one more simple way

502
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,370
that it can help you
live a better day.

exciting updates we have planned

That was really terrific.

509
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:59,261
I was actually using the
Breathe app back stage.

510
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:00,756
It helped me a bit.

511
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:07,428
So, watchOS 3 is a giant step
forward for you as developers.

512
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:10,071
When someone adds your apps
to dock or to the watch face,

513
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:12,367
it benefits from all the
instant launch experience

514
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,410
that we're showing and
you get background time

515
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,975
to update your information
before someone goes and looks.

516
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:19,214
And that will enable
really quick interactions

517
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,980
with your app on the watch.

518
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:23,218
Now you can already build
apps that are native to watch

519
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,914
that you can run
independent of iPhone,

520
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:26,515
but we're also adding a number

521
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:28,117
of new APIs you can
take advantage

522
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,719
of when you're building
apps for the watch.

523
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,591
One of those is support now
for Apple Pay within your app

524
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,831
on the watch, so you can
do purchases right there.

525
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,067
Fitness apps will now be able

526
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:40,662
to run the background during
workouts enabling access

527
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,335
to real-time heart rate
information and motion data.

528
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,634
This is going to enable
a whole new category

529
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:48,306
of fitness apps on the watch.

530
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:51,505
Also we're enabling a much
richer and expressive apps

531
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,579
in watchOS including support
for SpriteKit and SceneKit,

532
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:59,218
native event support from the
crown and for touch gestures.

533
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:00,456

535
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,858
Audio and video can be embedded
right inside your app UI

536
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:08,297
and you can connect
across devices

537
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,932
with Game Center and CloudKit.

538
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:13,067
So we're really excited about
what new apps now can be created

539
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,434
on the watch and they're
going to be amazing.

540
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,803
This is a great new
opportunity for all of you.

541
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,602

for you is available today,

like a whole new watch.

of what's coming

a look at tvOS,

[ Cheering and Applause ]

552
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:02,008
So let's talk about
tvOS and Apple TV.

553
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:05,312
Last fall, we introduced the
next generation of Apple TV

554
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,786
and for the first time,
developers had a modern platform

555
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:12,186
like iOS to develop
for in the living room.

556
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:15,759
And we said the future
of TV is apps.

557
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,330
And the response to Apple
TV has been incredible.

558
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,100
Here is what Chris Albrecht
the CEO of Starz had to say.

559
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,200
tvOS has allowed Starz
to create an experience

560
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:29,003
on Apple TV unlike
anything we've done before

561
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,906
and our subscribers
are loving it.

562
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,379
Here is what the CEO of BoomBit,

563
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:36,347
a very popular iOS game
developer had to say.

564
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,517
We easily extended our iOS game
experience to the living room,

565
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,617
something that is
incredibly difficult to do

566
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,859
on traditional consoles.

567
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:47,654
Our last generation Apple TV
had 80 video channels and thanks

568
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:52,498
to many of you, we now have
over 1300 video channels.

First, Sling which
offers a great selection

00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:09,984
of live cable channels is
coming to Apple TV today.

like Minecraft story
mode and SketchParty.

581
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:50,555
Use your iPhone or iPad
to draw and then you sit

around the TV to guess.

583
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:55,929
It's a lot of fun to do this
with your group of friends.

584
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:58,666
Now we've got great updates
to tell you about for tvOS

585
00:29:58,662 --> 00:30:02,462
and let me start with
the Apple TV remote app.

586
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:05,606
Now Apple TV comes with
the incredible Siri remote.

587
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,773
It uses touch for navigation,
Siri to tell it what you want

588
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:11,772
to watch, and motion
to play games.

589
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:13,345
But a lot of our
customers have told us

590
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,444
that they would love
an app on their iPhone

591
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,646
that had all those
same capabilities,

592
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:20,388
and so we're making a new
version of the remote app.

593
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:21,454
This is what it looks like.

594
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,992
It's got a beautiful
mount playing screen

595
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,187
with playback controls,
but most importantly,

00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,789
all the features
of the Siri remote.

597
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,161
You have touch for navigation,
Siri to give it commands,

598
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:35,531
and it uses the accelerometer
and gyroscope to play games.

Next let's talk about Siri.

602
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,653
Siri changed the way we
interact with our television

603
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,649
because now we just tell
it what we want to watch.

604
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,352
And we're making it even better

605
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:59,593
because now you can
search movies by topics.

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,130
Now my daughter is actually
going to high school this fall

607
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,226

I went to high school,

608

it's been a while, there
are some great movies

that I'd love to watch with her.

610
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,999

easy because I can just say,

of my favorites.

them all.

"Ferris Bueller's Day Off"

618

and with just one tap,
we can start watching.

Now Siri actually searches over
650,000 movies and TV shows now,

620
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,962
but what about YouTube?

621
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,265

because now you just ask Siri.

Curry three pointers.

623

shows you the results.

experience is live channels.

and you launch a video
channel app for the first time,

639
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:47,598

this change a little bit.

to do it for each in every app.

many features we've got.

679
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,145
Things like support for
four game controllers,

sessions and a lot more.

And that is a quick
update to the tvOS.

A new Apple TV remote app,
great Siri enhancements,

with topic search,
YouTube and Live Tune-In.

great tools for developers.

And of course, no

complete without some kind

697

of naming controversy.

some allegedly baked members

of marketing team going on
some kind of vision quest

700
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,424
around California looking
for a special name.

701
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:01,221
I'm actually talking about
the name OS X itself.

702
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:06,395
You know, OS X has been with
us as a name for over 15 years.

703
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:07,836
And it served us so well.

704
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:13,001
But as we look at it
alongside its younger brethren,

705
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:14,903
something sticks out.

706
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:18,445
We realized that there's a name
that would be so much clearer

707
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,112
and so much more elegant.

708
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,150
And so we're making it so.

709
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:26,716
The name of the world's most
advanced desktop operating

Mac OS does have a special name

after a place that's
especially important

714
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:47,508
to us here in California.

715
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,704
And this year's Mac
OS is no different.

716
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:53,977

time was obvious.

of the Mac experience.

722
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,235
I want to start with continuity.

723
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:20,204
Because continuity is like
magic, your devices are able

724
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:22,503
to sense themselves around you

725
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:26,276
and use secure peer-to-peer
wireless protocols to enable you

one task that we all do many
times a day every time we start

feature is called auto unlock.

733
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:49,971
Today, when you first
approach your Mac to use it,

734
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,966
the experience is
something like this.

735
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:55,308
You open it up, you confront
with a password field,

736
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:56,775
then you type, and
then maybe mistyped,

737
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:59,813
and then retype your
password, and then you're

738
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,210
in and using your Mac.

739
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:02,351
But you know for many of us,

740
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,516
we already have a device
securely authenticated

741
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:07,284
to our wrists that
already knows who we are

742
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,424
and could tell our Mac.

743
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:11,259
And so then, when
we open our Mac,

744
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:14,194
it could be a little
bit more like this.

745
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,331
And we're in.

746
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:18,466

748
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,933
And we made this really secure
using time of flight networking

749
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:29,036
to make sure it's you who's
that close to the machine

750
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,239
who is unlocking it,
so it's really great.

00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:38,817
in macOS Sierra is
universal clipboard.

Now-- Wow, gasp.

754
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:47,462
So-- but I know copy and paste
is so fundamental to the way

755
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,957
that we use our Macs
for so many years now.

756
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,601
But what if when you
are on even your iPhone

757
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,667
and you found some new text,
and you just want to copy it,

758
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:59,166
that when you then
went to your Mac,

759
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:02,309
well you could just
paste it right in.

and specifically iCloud Drive.

764
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:18,525
Now today with iCloud
Drive, you can put documents

765
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,622
into your iCloud Drive
that you explicitly want

766

to make available to you

quite a bit of this.

this a step further.

do you do about it?

Well, it turns out we're
going to give you a solution.

And it works in two ways.

794
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:30,156
First, it helps you make
room for the files that--

795
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,830
your new files by keeping your
older ones up in the Cloud.

796

full resolution photos,

797
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,733
when your others are in
iCloud Drive or movies

798
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:41,175
that you've already
watched in iTunes

799
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:44,471
or even those old mail
attachments, we can clear off

800
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:46,444
that space locally and
make those things available

801
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,643
to you on demand.

802
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:49,844
But we also want to make
it easy for you to get rid

803
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:52,946
of files you'll never
use again automatically.

804
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:56,049
Things like your Safari web
cache and maybe the trash

805
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,552
that you keep forgetting
to empty

806
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:00,054
and redundant data that's stored
by mail, well, we can get rid

807
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:01,656
of all of that as well.

808
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:04,298
And we provide a really
simple user interface

809
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,934
to help you do it.

810
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:09,199
Now, as a task, we took a
system that was nearly full,

811
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,469
had about let's say
20 gigs free,

812
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,238
and we put it through the paces.

813
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:16,706
Now, it had a lot of photos
and a lot of documents.

814
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:19,346
It had movies that were
already watched, mail with lots

815
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:22,242
of attachment, apps,
system files and so forth.

816
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:24,845
And we turned on all the
switches for optimized storage.

817
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:29,688
And we went from 20 gigs
free to 150 gigs free.

818
00:41:29,686 --> 00:41:30,656

00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:53,006
And of course, this works
with your Apple Watch as well.

844
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,073
So, you can authenticate with
just a tap on your wrist.

845
00:42:56,072 --> 00:42:58,172
And already, many, many
merchants are signed

846
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:00,714
up to bring their
web storefronts

847
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,250
to support Apple Pay on the web.

848
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:05,545
And Apple Pay is expanding
hugely geographically.

849
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:09,658
It's now available in the
United States, the UK, Canada,

850
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,323
Australia, China and Singapore.

851

And in the next few months,

852
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:17,663
it's coming to Switzerland,
France and Hong Kong.

853
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,231
Now, next, I want
to move to part

854
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,299
of the Mac experience,
and that's tabs.

855
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:26,538
You know, many of us love using
tabs to take a mess of windows

856
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:29,306
that we have in Safari and
get them neatly organized

857
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:30,675
in tab set.

858
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,314
Well, now, we want
to bring that to all

859
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:34,849
of your multi-windowed apps.

860
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:37,444
So, maybe you have multiple
windows open in maps, well,

861
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:39,447
you could organize
those in tabs.

862
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:41,719
But because it's built into
the system, you could do

863
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:43,718
that for third apps as well.

864
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,690
In fact, we've implemented
it in a way

865
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,429
that the apps you already have
installed can support this

866
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,425
out of the box without
any modification,

867
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,528
so tabs everywhere.

We love watching
video on the web.

871
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:06,144
But sometimes, we
like to keep track

872
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:08,112
of a video while we're
doing other work.

Well now, you can.

874
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,349
You can push the
picture-in-picture button.

875
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:12,416
Your video goes under
a nice little PIP.

But there is one more.

881

like to unusual step

00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,939
of letting this feature
introduce itself.

Hi, it's me.

884
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:43,948
It's sure is great
to be on the Mac.

885
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:44,977
How about a demo?

886
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:45,751
That's right.

And it looks like Siri
would like to a give a demo.

00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:57,693
So, let's get to it.

891
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:02,264
So, we have macOS
Sierra right here.

892
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:04,205
And the first thing
you'll notice is right here

893
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,800
on the dock, we have
access to Siri.

894
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:09,304
So, I can ask Siri a question.

895
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:13,545
Let's say, how do you
like being on a Mac?

896
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:16,983
Pretty awesome, lots of
space, aluminum unibody walls

897
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,120
and no complaints about
the lack of Windows.

898
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:21,486

900
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,388
So, it's the same Siri
that we know and love.

901
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,760
But now on a Mac, it
can do so much more.

902
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:32,959
Things like sophisticated
queries for files

903
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:38,002
like show the files I worked
on last week about the offsite.

904
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:42,571
Have I ever told you
your file is so styling.

905
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:44,612
So, we have my
search results.

906
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:46,407
But what's really
incredible is I can refine

907
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:49,309
that sophisticated query
with a follow on like,

908
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:53,582
just the ones Ken sent me
that I tagged with draft.

909
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,553
For your filling pleasure.

So you see I have just
the files I'm looking

911
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:00,021
for right there.

912
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,393

useful result that I may want

to throughout the day as I work.

on this plus button

915
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:10,302
and pin it right here into
my notification center.

916

it's really great.

of your Siri results.

little project here.

an offsite.

get on with the demo.

here for slacklining.

in my Siri result.

search the web for me.

for pictures of falconry.

like some good fun.

working on here on my iPad.

take my Apple Pencil here

00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:37,421
and I'm going to draw a path.

a hike like this,

just the drawing I want.

to now get it on my Mac.

should just see a movie.

I can reposition the PIP
window to any corner.

00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:35,837
[ Applause ]

1011
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:39,772
Now, iOS 10 is a huge
release for the developers.

1012
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:44,579
And it is the biggest iOS
release ever for our users.

1013
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,974
Now, there are 10 big features
I want to talk about today.

1014
00:50:47,977 --> 00:50:52,887
And let's start off with number
one, that's user experience.

1015
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:56,352
Now, in iOS 10, we've
redesigned the experience

1016
00:50:56,352 --> 00:50:57,692
of the lock screen.

1017
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,657
With rich notifications, they
give you quick interaction

1018
00:51:00,656 --> 00:51:04,326
with apps through the
expanded use of 3D Touch.

1019
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,897
But rather than just
talk about it,

1020
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:07,995
how about I just show
it to you right now?

1021
00:51:07,997 --> 00:51:09,497
Let's do a demo.

1022
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:14,169
[ Applause ]

1023
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,310
Now, one thing a lot
of us have noticed now

1024
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:18,045
that we have our iPhone 6ses

1025
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,880
with the incredibly
fast Touch ID sensor is

1026
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,617
that we can just blow
past our notifications

1027
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,043
on our lock screen.

1028
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:26,487
We never even get to see them.

1029
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:30,622
And so, in iOS 10, we
have a great solution.

1030
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,160
It's called raise to wake.

1031
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,055
And it lets you see
what's on your lock screen

1032
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:36,827
without ever touching a button.

1033
00:51:36,826 --> 00:51:38,566
Let me show it to you now.

1034
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:43,531
I just raised my wrist and
phone wakes up just like that.

1035
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:49,173
[ Applause ]

1036
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,672
Now, the first thing you'll
notice is these beautiful

1037
00:51:51,674 --> 00:51:54,314
notifications are
no longer causing us

1038
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:56,650
to darken the-- your wallpapers.

1039
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,946
So, you get to look at that.

1040
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,987
But what's more important is
they're really interactive

1041
00:51:59,982 --> 00:52:01,252
through 3D Touch.

1042
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,850
So, for instance with this
calendar notification,

1043
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:05,753
I can just 3D Touch on it.

1044
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,825
And I can jump right in and
get all this rich detail

1045
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:10,424
about this invitation.

1046
00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:11,426
I can see my calendar.

1047
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:14,167
And I can accept right here.

1048
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:16,933
Now, this is especially
great with messages.

1049
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,003
Let's 3D Touch into that one.

1050
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:21,871
And here, you see, I see the
message that was sent to me.

1051
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:24,541
I can respond right
here, the keyboard.

1052
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,610
But what's great is I can
stay in the conversation,

1053
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,910
right here on the lock screen.

1054
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:31,851
And even get rich responses
like images right inline.

1055
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:34,987
And this works really well
with third-party apps as well.

1056
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:37,554
So, for instance if I get
a notification from Uber,

1057
00:52:37,553 --> 00:52:42,093
I can just press in and I get
this completely interactive

1058
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:48,131
and animated live status update
on my car as it comes in.

1059
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,800
It's really great.

1060
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:52,637
Now, of course as always,

1061
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:54,835
you can get your
notifications right here

1062
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:56,377
from the top of the screen.

1063
00:52:56,372 --> 00:53:00,072
But now, with 3D Touch,
if you want to clear them,

1064
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,146
you can just press in and
clear them all with a tap.

1065
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:04,485
It's really great.

1066
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,050
[ Applause ]

1067
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,090
Now, control center is
available from the bottom

1068
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,116
of the screen as well.

1069
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,090
We can just swipe
up from the bottom.

1070
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,629
See, it's beautifully
redesigned,

1071
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,364
gives me great access
to all my controls.

1072
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,559
But if I swipe over, you
see, we have a special area

1073
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:21,702
for our music with
nice big controls

1074
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:24,697
and beautiful album
art right there.

1075
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,076
Now, we'd made it
easier than ever to get

1076
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:31,041
at your camera from
the lock screen.

1077
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
So, I can just slide
over from the right,

1078
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,712
and there's my camera.

1079
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:39,650
And it's easy to take a picture
of my demo notes, right there.

1080
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,349
That's good.

1081
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:43,450
And we've made it easier than
ever to get at your widgets.

1082
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:45,452
Just slide over the other way.

1083
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,224
You can see I have my weather.

1084
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,393
I have my calendar.

1085
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,591
I get my news top stories.

1086
00:53:50,593 --> 00:53:52,663
And you notice these widgets
have the ability for me

1087
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,862
to get more information.

1088
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:57,603
So, I can do show more and
see the rest of my day.

1089
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,200
You'd like to think.

1090
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:04,042
And I can even get more
information right here

1091
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,280
from apps on my home screen.

1092
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:08,045
So, for instance, it looks
like I have decent number

1093
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,414
of unread e-mail messages.

1094
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,312
And now, if I 3D Touch there,

1095
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:14,654
I can see who it is I've been
ignoring this whole time,

1096
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,750
my VIPs.

1097
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:20,152
Now, if I swipe over here, I
can also get great information

1098
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,256
on the activity without
even launching the app.

1099
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,228
I just 3D Touch in and
get a look at my rings.

1100
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:28,967
And this can work really well
with third-party apps as well.

1101
00:54:28,964 --> 00:54:30,464
So, I'm going to jump into ESPN.

1102
00:54:30,466 --> 00:54:33,106
I can see information
about my latest team.

1103
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:35,742
And if I want that widget
available to me at all times

1104
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:38,978
on My Today view, I can just
add that widget like that.

1105
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:41,714
And I go over to My Today
view, and there it is.

1106
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,951
And I can get that
show more information.

1107
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:45,816
And you see, I get
a graphical update

1108
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,585
on the highlights
from the last game.

1109
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:51,283
And if I tap in, live action.

1110
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,957

1111
00:54:52,955 --> 00:54:54,225
Shot clock at seven.

1112
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:56,763
Curry fakes, puts up a three.

1113
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:57,529
Bang.

1114
00:54:57,526 --> 00:54:58,366
Bang.

1115
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,061
Stephen Curry from downtown.

1116
00:54:59,061 --> 00:55:01,261
It's a 10-point game.

1117
00:55:01,263 --> 00:55:02,403
Oh yeah.

1118
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:05,738
So, that is a quick look
at the new lock screen

1119
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,905
and home screen experience
in iOS 10.

1120
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:10,944
You have a beautiful
new control center,

1121
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,910
interactive notifications and
great ways to use your widgets.

1122
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,710
It's great on the iPhone
and the iPad as well.

1123
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:22,384
Next, number two, Siri,

1124
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:26,085
huge part of the user
experience in iOS.

1125
00:55:26,088 --> 00:55:30,528
Now, Siri services over
two billion requests a week

1126
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:31,726
from customers.

1127
00:55:31,727 --> 00:55:34,497
And there's so many things
that you can ask Siri.

1128
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:39,607
But now in iOS 10, Siri is going
to be able to do so much more

1129
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:43,502
because we're opening
up Siri to developers.

1130
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:52,586
[ Applause ]

1131
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:57,886
Now, you'll be able to ask
Siri, things like, send a WeChat

1132
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,587
to Nancy saying, I'll
be five minutes late.

1133
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:03,959
And Siri can summon up
the WeChat UI right inside

1134
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:06,029
of the Siri environment.

1135
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:09,798
Now, of course, Siri, because
it understands the domains

1136
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,139
of things like messaging,
it allows you to say things

1137
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:13,534
in so many different ways.

1138
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,176
I could've said, WeChat Nancy
that I'll be five minutes late

1139
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,502
or I need to send a message

1140
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:20,046
to Nancy via WeChat saying
I'll be five minutes late.

1141
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:22,642
And I could do that in all
sorts of different languages.

1142
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,415
But because now in iOS 10,
we have an intense API,

1143
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:29,314
it allows Siri to take
on that part of the work

1144
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:32,958
and lets the extension do what
it does best, like messaging.

1145
00:56:32,955 --> 00:56:36,555
And so, now, we support
messaging with apps like,

1146
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,129
Slack and WhatsApp
and, of course, WeChat.

1147
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:43,129
It could do things like ride
booking in Siri with services

1148
00:56:43,132 --> 00:56:48,672
like Uber, Lyft and Didi in
China, photo search for--

1149
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:52,971
in apps like IM,
Shutterfly and Pinterest.

1150
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:57,485
And you could start, pause
and stop your workouts in apps

1151
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,920
like MapMyRun, Runtastic
and Runkeeper.

1152
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:04,216
And even do payments to
send money to friends,

1153
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,920
with things like Number 26,
Square Cash and Alipay in China.

1154
00:57:08,924 --> 00:57:11,764
And do VoIP calling through apps

1155
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,700
like Cisco Spark,
Vonage and Skype.

1156
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,037
And it works great
in the car as well.

1157
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:21,942
Because with CarPlay, you can
now safely send your messages

1158
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:26,077
as well as make VoIP calls all
inside the CarPlay environment

1159
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,175
with your favorite apps.

1160
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:31,476
And that's a quick
update on Siri.

1161
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:38,120
[ Applause ]

1162
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,690
Number three, QuickType.

1163
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:44,629
And the big news this year is
we're bringing Siri intelligence

1164
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,367
to the keyboard.

1165
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:50,602
So, today, QuickType is
able to use a context

1166
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,939
to help predict what
words you might type next.

1167
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,006
Well, now, we're
using deep learning

1168
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,645
and a technique specifically
called LSTMs

1169
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,441
to enable much more
intelligence in longer context.

1170
00:58:02,444 --> 00:58:04,744
So, we can tell the difference
between, the Orioles are playing

1171
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,387
in the playoffs and the
children are playing

1172
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,353
in the park automatically.

1173
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:12,821
And Siri can help you do
responses more intelligently

1174
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:13,891
than ever.

1175
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:15,989
So, you might get
asked, where are you?

1176
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:18,591
Well, Siri can suggest right
there on the suggestion bar

1177
00:58:18,594 --> 00:58:20,894
that you supply your
current location.

1178
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:22,666
Tap it and you can
get your location

1179
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,805
with the map right
into your transcript.

1180
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:28,241
And people might ask you
about contact information

1181
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:31,107
for a friend, well, Siri
can automatically offer

1182
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:34,276
up the most relevant contacts.

1183
00:58:34,276 --> 00:58:37,716
Now, right locally on your
device, Siri has information

1184
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:39,653
about what you've been doing.

1185
00:58:39,648 --> 00:58:42,318
And so, it can extract
information from a message

1186
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:43,588
that maybe says,
oh, you're talking

1187
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:46,056
about dim sum at
11 a.m. on Sunday?

1188
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,055
Well, when you go

1189
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,226
to automatically
create a calendar event,

1190
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:51,694
Siri can prefill it for
you with things like,

1191
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,294
oh, that must be brunch.

1192
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:54,635
Fill out the location.

1193
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,830
Pick the time.

1194
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:57,701
It's really smart.

1195
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,000
And Siri does so much more.

1196
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,902
It can check your
calendar availability

1197
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,234
for you automatically.

1198
00:59:03,238 --> 00:59:06,278
Help you paste a recent
address automatically.

1199
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:10,415
Fill it in based on addresses
you were browsing in other apps.

1200
00:59:10,412 --> 00:59:12,582
It can help you look
up terms it recognizes,

1201
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:14,651
things like movies
and restaurants.

1202
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,850
With one tap, you can
get more information.

1203
00:59:16,852 --> 00:59:20,092
And Siri now-- the
QuickType keyboard supports

1204
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,089
multilingual typing.

1205
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,091
So, if you like typing
alternating maybe

1206
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:27,163
between English and
Spanish or Italian,

1207
00:59:27,162 --> 00:59:29,302
you don't have to
switch keyboards.

1208
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:31,468
QuickType can follow
you automatically.

1209
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,107
[ Applause ]

1210
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,503
So, that's QuickType.

1211
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:39,074
Next, number four is photos.

1212
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:42,674
Now, we love capturing
so much of our lives

1213
00:59:42,678 --> 00:59:45,748
on our cameras with--
on our iPhones.

1214
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,118
They're so great.

1215
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,886
And with iCloud Photo Library,
we have those photos with us

1216
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,185
across all of our devices.

1217
00:59:52,187 --> 00:59:55,427
Well, we wanted to give you
easier ways, of course, to find

1218
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:57,624
and experience the
photos that you've taken.

1219
00:59:57,626 --> 01:00:00,166
And one of those is with places.

1220
01:00:00,162 --> 01:00:03,562
So now, we let you see all
of your photos on a map.

1221
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:06,305
It's a great way to
relive a trip for instance.

1222
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:09,541
But the big news in photos
this year is advanced

1223
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:10,878
computer vision.

1224
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,443
We're applying advanced
deep learning techniques

1225
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:17,242
to bring facial recognition
to the iPhone

1226
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,246
and it's all done locally
on device taking advantage

1227
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,449
of the power of the
advanced silicon

1228
01:00:22,451 --> 01:00:24,421
in all of our iOS devices.

1229
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,760
You can get all of your most
important people automatically

1230
01:00:27,756 --> 01:00:32,626
built in the people albums for
you automatically and all done

1231
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:34,298
with your privacy protected.

1232
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,596
Now, we're applying the
same kind of technology

1233
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:40,908
with deep learning to object
and scene recognition as well.

1234
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:45,373
In fact, we do 11 billion
computations per photo

1235
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:47,674
to be able to detect
things like there's a horse,

1236
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:49,376
there's water, there's
a mountain.

1237
01:00:49,378 --> 01:00:52,718
And with this, you can do
really powerful searching

1238
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,155
on your device.

1239
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,790
But, you know, sometimes,
the magic in experiencing

1240
01:00:57,786 --> 01:01:00,286
in your photos isn't just
about finding the photo

1241
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,789
that you know you're
looking for,

1242
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:04,760
it's about being reminded
serendipitously of a memory

1243
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,030
that would be so special.

1244
01:01:06,028 --> 01:01:09,498
And so now, we're using
advanced artificial intelligence

1245
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:13,438
to analyze across your entire
photo library, all done locally

1246
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:17,435
on device, to cluster together
photos and relate them based

1247
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:21,109
on location, the people
involved, the scenes.

1248
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,780
And out of this, be
able to surface memories

1249
01:01:22,778 --> 01:01:25,618
that would be most relevant
to you at any given moment.

1250
01:01:25,614 --> 01:01:28,384
We can bring forward
things like trips.

1251
01:01:28,383 --> 01:01:31,023
We can spot trips that
might be important to you.

1252
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:33,519
We can figure out that you
might want to see photos

1253
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:36,692
of a highlight reel of the
last weekend or the last year

1254
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:39,462
and offer those to you
at just the right time.

1255
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:42,961
We can bring forward memories
of people that are special

1256
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,065
to you or groups of people.

1257
01:01:45,067 --> 01:01:48,407
And topics, special photos
you took, for instance,

1258
01:01:48,403 --> 01:01:51,073
when you're on the water, at
the beach, at the mountains,

1259
01:01:51,073 --> 01:01:54,513
these can make wonderful
memories to survey over time.

1260
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,410
But most important,
we pull these together

1261
01:01:57,412 --> 01:02:02,482
into an intuitive user interface
that makes these so engaging.

1262
01:02:02,484 --> 01:02:06,484
And I'd like to show
you that experience now.

1263
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:12,058
[ Applause ]

1264
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,000
So let's take a look at photos.

1265
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:17,296
So we see there's a photo
album here of a family.

1266
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:18,429
But what you'll notice

1267
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:21,073
at the bottom is this
new tab called Memories.

1268
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:22,269
Let's take a look.

1269
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,911
So we can see here, there
are number of memories

1270
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,447
that have been offered up
into this memory speed.

1271
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:28,942
And at the top, there's
a vacation

1272
01:02:28,944 --> 01:02:30,074
that the system has spotted

1273
01:02:30,078 --> 01:02:32,648
where the family took
a trip to Tahoe City.

1274
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:35,548
Let's dive in and take
a look at a memory.

1275
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,021
Now you see there's actually
a movie up at the top,

1276
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,290
we'll talk more about
that later.

1277
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,158
And down below, there's
this beautiful layout

1278
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:43,757
of highlights of the photos.

1279
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:46,929
Now, I can tap Show All
and actually see a grid

1280
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,329
of every photo that was taken.

1281
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,870
But you can see how the
summary intelligently draws

1282
01:02:50,866 --> 01:02:54,066
out the most special
photos into these highlights

1283
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:55,539
that are really great to browse.

1284
01:02:55,537 --> 01:02:58,837
Now, if we go further down, we
see that it's actually pulled

1285
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:02,311
up a set of people that are in
the photo, the family, grandma

1286
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,711
and grandpa and the uncle.

1287
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:07,212
And a map of the location where
all of those photos were taken.

1288
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,116
And down here at the bottom,

1289
01:03:09,117 --> 01:03:11,217
we have related other
memories I might want

1290
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,220
to see related to this one.

1291
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:13,591
And it's really smart.

1292
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:18,189
So you see that the Santa Cruz
and Fourth of July memories,

1293
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:20,163
where grandma and grandpa
were both on the trip

1294
01:03:20,162 --> 01:03:21,362
into Tahoe City and in these.

1295
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:23,063
So those are offered
up as related.

1296
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,065
And this Tahoe City trip
was an outdoor vacation,

1297
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,367
so it would offered up
another one like Alaska.

1298
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:30,109
And you can see, there's
another time the family was also

1299
01:03:30,105 --> 01:03:32,105
at Tahoe City, but this
time in the winter.

1300
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:34,707
And I'm going to jump in
to that related memory.

1301
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,380
And you see once again, we have
photos and videos at the bottom.

1302
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,820
But I want to highlight the
movie up here at the top.

1303
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:44,817
You know, we all take so
many pictures and movies

1304
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,060
and we never go back to
actually assemble them

1305
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:49,095
into something we'd
want to watch.

1306
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:52,331
But, now our iPhone can do
that for us automatically.

1307
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:56,527
Let's see what the iPhone
has created for this memory.

1309
01:04:27,462 --> 01:04:29,502

[ Applause ]

1311

The advanced computer vision

1312
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:39,875
of the Photos App is now doing
analysis of just the right parts

1313
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,375
of the video to include
the right photos

1314
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:45,047
and it's editing them
together with the right mood

1315
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,417
and with the right music.

1316
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,615
Now, when you have
a memory like this,

1317
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:50,017
you often want to share it.

1318
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:51,688
And sometimes, you might want
to make it a little shorter say

1319
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,557
for sharing, so I can just
use this slider at the bottom

1320
01:04:54,556 --> 01:04:56,526
and say, I'd like
it to be shorter.

1321
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,395
And maybe I want to change
the mood a little it.

1322
01:04:58,393 --> 01:05:00,593
You notice there's a mood
slider just up above there

1323
01:05:00,595 --> 01:05:02,335
and that was a pretty
great snowball fight.

1324
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,361
So I'll pick epic.

1325
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:05,405
And based on these changes,

1326
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,340
it's going to completely
re-edit the movie to new music.

1327

about the big news in all

of our biggest services
here at Apple.

Thank you, Craig.

1349
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:22,379
I love the new Photos.

1350
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:24,477
Can't wait to do it.

1351
01:06:24,479 --> 01:06:26,719
So, let's talk-- Let's
get started with Maps.

1352
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:29,015
Now last year, we
introduced Nearby,

1353
01:06:29,017 --> 01:06:31,687
a great way to find
places and transit

1354
01:06:31,686 --> 01:06:33,286
with an incredible amount

1355
01:06:33,288 --> 01:06:35,058
of detail including
all the entrances

1356
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:37,357
and exits from every station.

1357
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:41,199
But for iOS 10, we've got
an all new design for Maps.

1358
01:06:41,196 --> 01:06:43,596
It starts with making it
easy to access controls

1359
01:06:43,598 --> 01:06:45,838
and details on locations.

1360
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,674
And we're making Maps do
more for you in advance.

1361
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,370
It's more proactive.

1362
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:53,872
So you slide up from the
bottom and you can suggestions.

1363
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:57,845
Maps knows that usually, at
this time, I usually go to work,

1364
01:06:57,846 --> 01:07:02,186
or it can look at a calendar
event and find the location.

1365
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,784
It also gives you
convenient ways to filter

1366
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:07,056
down in the places
you might want to go.

1367
01:07:07,055 --> 01:07:09,155
For example, let's take a
look at restaurants nearby.

1368
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:12,597
But we're in San Francisco,
I feel like seafood.

1369
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:15,464
So I can slide across
the bottom, and now,

1370
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,204
I can see all the
seafood restaurants right

1371
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,469
in San Francisco.

Now, were applying all of
these new designs to Navigation

1374
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:29,741
as well so you get more
information, it makes it easier

1375
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:34,614
to follow and control and we
even include traffic on route.

1376
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:38,916
Now, when you're driving, it
will automatically zoom in

1377
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,490
and as you get to
along straight away,

1378
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,289
it willl automatically
zoom back out.

1379
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:45,830
And you can even pan and
zoom way further ahead

1380
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:48,497

conditions are.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

1382
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:56,074
Now we give you quick controls
to let you see route details.

1383
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:59,411
So now, you can even look and
see on your route where food

1384
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:02,647
or gas stations are and Maps
will tell you how much longer it

1385
01:08:02,644 --> 01:08:05,444
will take if you go
to any one of those.

And of course, we're making
this available on CarPlay.

01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:13,593
And if there's a lot
of traffic ahead,

1389
01:08:13,588 --> 01:08:16,188
Maps will proactively
give you alternate routes

and tell you how
much time it'll save.

keeping your eyes on the road,

capabilities in Maps.

01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:50,125
For example, you can make a
reservation using a popular app

1402
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,525
like OpenTable.

1403
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:55,566
You pick the number of people,
the time right inside of Maps.

1404
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,804
And because these are
extensions, they're open

Now, on to number
eight and it's HomeKit.

1624
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:03,235
You know, before we announce
HomeKit two years ago,

1625
01:19:03,237 --> 01:19:06,807
the home accessory space
was a mess of incompatible

1626
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:10,408
and insecure protocols and
accessories that required you

1627
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:13,451
to download a separate app
that you needed to learn just

1628
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:16,247
to control each individual
accessory.

1629
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,450
But with HomeKit, we've
been changing all that.

If you want to turn on the
light, of course, just tap it.

in a little harder and slide

1658

dimmer just like that.

So you can tap, tap, tap
across all the accessories

1661

you'd like to trigger a
change to all of them.

1662

And for that, we have
something we call Scenes.

1663
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:49,978
So for instance, if you
want to get ready for bed,

1664
01:20:49,977 --> 01:20:52,947
you can tap Good Night.

1665

You'll see they'll close
the living room shades,

lock the front door, adjust the
thermostat, all in one step.

Now Siri knows how to
interact with Scenes as well.

So in the morning, you
say good morning to Siri.

Well Siri can automatically
get your home all ready for you

actually built right

for instance, open
up your garage door.

of our interactive
notifications as well.

of your front door camera,

of your accessories,
securely end to end encrypted

1692

and you can setup automation
like Geofences so that

1693
01:22:09,223 --> 01:22:11,593
when you roll into your
driveway, you can make sure

1694
01:22:11,592 --> 01:22:14,432
that the garage door will
open, the lights will turn on

welcome to Bethany and Emron.

Thanks Craig.

1841
01:29:20,687 --> 01:29:23,527
We are so thrilled
to finally be able

1842
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,564
to show you what
we've working on.

1843
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:28,099
Now Emron and I are going to
show you the different ways

1844
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:31,065
that we use messages, but
I'm going to kick things off

1845
01:29:31,064 --> 01:29:34,034
by jumping first into a
thread with my sister Lori

1846
01:29:34,034 --> 01:29:35,774
who just got to a graduation.

1847
01:29:35,769 --> 01:29:40,709
So let's write her back
and say give her my love

1848
01:29:40,707 --> 01:29:46,417
and tell her I said
happy graduation day.

1849
01:29:46,413 --> 01:29:48,153
OK. Now typically, I would hunt

1850
01:29:48,148 --> 01:29:50,588
for the perfect emoji
to tack on the end.

1851
01:29:50,584 --> 01:29:53,554
But now, when I tap on
the emoji button to switch

1852
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:56,824
to the emoji keyboard,
words throughout my message

1853
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,364
that can be swap for emoji
or automatically highlighted

1854
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:01,099
and all I have to do
is tap to replace them.

1855
01:30:01,094 --> 01:30:04,234
So I'm going to tap to
replace love and I'm going

1856
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:06,471
to choose the type of
hearts I want to send.

1857
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:08,537
I'm going to do bedazzled
I think.

1858
01:30:08,535 --> 01:30:10,705
And I can tap on happy
and I choose how happy

1859
01:30:10,704 --> 01:30:12,504
and I choose how
happy I want to be.

1860
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:13,606

the upside down one.

01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:18,583

closed kind of happy and I tap

switches to the cap

I would have found that.

been here for days.

ahead and send that off.

01:30:38,265 --> 01:30:41,805
So Lori just send through a
digital touch video and what's

1874
01:30:41,802 --> 01:30:43,202
so awesome about this is

1875
01:30:43,203 --> 01:30:46,973
that she created this entire
thing using digital touch right

1876
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:48,104
from within Messages.

1877
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:49,808
And it's so much fun
to make, aren't they?

1878
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:52,410
Yeah, and really, really
fun to watch and I'm going

1879
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:55,512
to let her know how I feel
about it, using tap X,

1880
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:57,686
which is as easy
as double tapping

and sending back a heart.

that fun and honestly,

to communicate now.

wait to see me this summer

1885

and I feel the same way.

1886

So I'm going to let her know,
I'm going to say, "Me too."

And I'm going to send this
using a bubble effect.

hold on the send button.

let her know how I'm feeling.

01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:26,110
But for developers who do want
to write code, they have access

2007
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:30,482
to the full iOS SDK including
access to the camera,

2008
01:36:30,483 --> 01:36:34,553
so you can incredible animated
effects with apps like JibJab.

2009
01:36:34,554 --> 01:36:37,754
You can accomplish more
sophisticated tasks as well

2010
01:36:37,757 --> 01:36:39,727
like payment with
Square Cash, allowing you

2011
01:36:39,726 --> 01:36:42,426
to pay someone right
through the messages thread.

2012
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,499
They can receive
it and redeem it

2013
01:36:44,497 --> 01:36:47,837
on the receiving end
right inside of Messages.

2014
01:36:47,834 --> 01:36:50,734
There's so much you can
do with iMessage apps.

2015
01:36:50,737 --> 01:36:52,307
I'd like to show you a couple

2016
01:36:52,305 --> 01:36:54,705
of the possibilities
in a demo right now.

2017
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,508
Let's take a look.

2018

[ Applause ]

2019
01:37:00,947 --> 01:37:03,947
So let's dive here
into a conversation.

2020
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,320
See here is a thread
with the family.

2021
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:09,019
Now I can respond
with text of course,

2022
01:37:09,022 --> 01:37:12,322
but now with iMessage apps, I
can just bring up my app drawer

2023
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:14,165
and I can get to all

2024
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:17,360
of my different iMessage apps
including some great stickers.

2025
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:19,604
So let me dive into
these Mickey stickers.

2026
01:37:19,599 --> 01:37:21,599
We can see that they're
all animated.

2027
01:37:21,601 --> 01:37:24,141
I can actually look
through them like this.

2028
01:37:24,137 --> 01:37:29,507
I can swipe between my stickers,
so maybe some from "Inside Out".

2029
01:37:29,509 --> 01:37:30,909
Here some from "Finding Dory".

2030
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:35,851
If I want to send one, just tap,
drop it right in just like that.

2031
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:38,489
It's really easy and
they're really fun.

2032
01:37:38,485 --> 01:37:40,685
And now, here I received another
photo and the great thing

2033
01:37:40,687 --> 01:37:43,957
about stickers is you can
actually peel them off

2034
01:37:43,957 --> 01:37:45,627
and attach them to bubbles.

2035
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,925
So, you know, this one will cool

2036
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:49,127
if I could just take
the sun over here.

2037
01:37:49,129 --> 01:37:51,369
Maybe put that up
there on the corner

2038
01:37:51,364 --> 01:37:56,734
and then maybe a little
seal off here on the side.

2039
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,106
Just like that.

2040
01:37:58,104 --> 01:37:59,904
It's really pretty cool what
you can do with these messages.

2041
01:37:59,906 --> 01:38:02,076
Well, look, I got a
message from Brian here.

2042
01:38:02,075 --> 01:38:03,475
Let's take a look at this.

2043
01:38:03,476 --> 01:38:05,676
He says, "We're placing an order
for lunch after the keynote."

2044
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,019
And we can see he's doing that
actually with an iMessage app.

2045
01:38:09,015 --> 01:38:12,055
So he's used DoorDash
and he's placing an order

2046
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:13,152
at Curry Up Now.

2047
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:15,823
So I can just tap in
and see what's going on.

2048
01:38:15,822 --> 01:38:18,192
Now, there's a group cart
that we're all collaborating

2049
01:38:18,191 --> 01:38:19,961
on through the iMessage apps.

2050
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,630
I'm going to look at that.

2051
01:38:21,628 --> 01:38:24,928
Looks like Phil has
ordered the Naughty Naan

2052
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:26,571
and Jaws [assumed
spelling] has ordered,

2053
01:38:26,566 --> 01:38:27,336
Brian's ordered as well.

2054
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:28,534
So I can put in my order.

2055
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:31,375
And I'm going to go for
this Deconstructed Samosa.

2056
01:38:31,371 --> 01:38:32,911
That looks pretty good.

2057
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:35,746
And I'm sure Tim would
like one as well.

2058
01:38:35,742 --> 01:38:37,942
And, well, it would be rude
if, you know, we ate in front

2059
01:38:37,944 --> 01:38:39,444
of you guys without
getting you some.

2060
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:42,986
So we'll just up this
up a little bit here

2061
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:46,753
and we can just add that to
our, to our cart like this

2062
01:38:46,753 --> 01:38:51,563
and then drop it,
write in the messages.

2063
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:55,498
And it's fortunate Brian
will be paying for this.

2065

So, a final thing
I'd like to show you

2066
01:39:01,134 --> 01:39:05,804
with iMessage apps are these
really fun interactive kinds

2067
01:39:05,805 --> 01:39:06,575
of apps.

2068
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:08,243
And one example is JibJab.

2069
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:10,641
So let's jump right
into JibJab here.

2070
01:39:10,643 --> 01:39:12,813
We see there are a whole
bunch of fun things.

2071
01:39:12,812 --> 01:39:15,282
You can scroll through and
see the options I can also

2072
01:39:15,281 --> 01:39:18,381
of course select from
a gallery of faces.

2073
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:22,625
Let's pick Eddy maybe and,
you know, I can just drop him

2074
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:26,992
in to the transcript
just like that.

2075
01:39:26,993 --> 01:39:29,093

you the sense of the power

2076

Apple Watch can receive all

of these interactive
content as well.

10 huge features in iOS 10.

much more that we can't have--

2085
01:39:59,926 --> 01:40:02,266
talk about right now
but I can't help myself

2086
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:05,762
but mention just a couple more
things like Notes collaboration.

release for our developers.

many other options.

of this great work

2104

in iOS 10 would be
meaningless to us if it came

at the expense of your privacy.

2106
01:41:07,927 --> 01:41:13,037
And so, in every feature that
we do, we carefully consider how

2107
01:41:13,032 --> 01:41:14,902
to protect your privacy.

2108
01:41:14,901 --> 01:41:18,301
With apps like FaceTime
and Messages and HomeKit,

2109
01:41:18,304 --> 01:41:23,274
we make sure to use end to end
encryption by default and always

to protect your communication.

2111

advanced deep learning

2112
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:32,619
and artificial intelligence
analysis of your data,

2113
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:35,189

using the incredible power

2114
01:41:35,188 --> 01:41:38,058
of the silicon on your
iPhone and your Mac,

01:41:38,057 --> 01:41:41,597
keeping your personal
data under your control.

2116
01:41:41,594 --> 01:41:44,634
And when you do do searches on
the internet maybe for a route

2117
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:48,701
and maps or a search for
information in Spotlight,

2118
01:41:48,701 --> 01:41:51,841
we don't build any
user profiles.

2119
01:41:51,838 --> 01:41:54,678
Now, of course one of
the important tools

2120
01:41:54,674 --> 01:41:58,174
in making software more
intelligent is to spot patterns

2121
01:41:58,178 --> 01:42:01,048
on how multiple users
are using their devices.

2122
01:42:01,047 --> 01:42:03,717
For instance, you might want to
know what new words are trending

2123
01:42:03,716 --> 01:42:08,526
so you could offer them up more
readily in a QuickType keyboard.

Well, differential privacy is
a research topic in the area

of statistics and data analytics
that uses hashing, subsampling

2126

and noise injection
to enable this kind

literally co-wrote the book

quick peek at what we were doing

01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:32,428
We believe it's crucial that
we provide the best tools

2171
01:45:32,425 --> 01:45:34,965
so you can create the best apps.

2172
01:45:34,961 --> 01:45:37,401
That's why we created Swift.

2173
01:45:37,397 --> 01:45:40,597
Swift is a powerful and
intuitive programming language

2174
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,470
for iOS, Mac OS,
watchOS, and tvOS.

2175
01:45:45,471 --> 01:45:50,281
And writing Swift code is fun
and interactive and apps written

2176
01:45:50,276 --> 01:45:53,546
in it are lighting fast.

2177
01:45:53,546 --> 01:45:57,786
Since we released Swift
less than two years ago,

2178
01:45:57,784 --> 01:46:01,584
we've seen an amazing response
from the developer community.

2179
01:46:01,587 --> 01:46:04,157
There's already more
than 100,000 apps

2180
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:08,657
that have adopted the use of
Swift code including great apps

2181
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:12,231
like Twitter and
Strava and Lyft.

2182
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:16,541
Now, we wanted everyone to
use Swift so we released it

2183
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:19,136
as open source in
December and since then,

2184
01:46:19,138 --> 01:46:21,738
the adoption has been amazing.

2185
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:26,611
It's already the number one
language project on GitHub.

2186
01:46:26,612 --> 01:46:31,252
Swift is powerful but it's also
simple and it's approachable.

2187
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:35,190
So it can be your very
first programming language.

2188
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:39,528
This is a very important
point for us.

2189
01:46:39,525 --> 01:46:44,565
Because Swift is so easy to
learn, it has the potential

2190
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:47,764
to bring many more
people into coding.

2191
01:46:47,767 --> 01:46:51,737
And this is an idea we would
like to take even further.

2192
01:46:51,737 --> 01:46:58,047
So today, we're introducing
a new app for iPad.

2193
01:46:58,044 --> 01:47:01,444
We call it Swift Playgrounds.

2194
01:47:01,447 --> 01:47:09,987
[ Cheering and Applause ]

2195
01:47:09,989 --> 01:47:14,389
Swift Playgrounds will
revolutionize the way people

2196
01:47:14,393 --> 01:47:17,433
learn to code and they'll
be able to do it right

2197
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:22,340
on their iPad which instantly
makes it accessible for hundreds

2198
01:47:22,335 --> 01:47:25,075
of millions of people
around the world.

2199
01:47:25,071 --> 01:47:27,371
There's never been
anything like this.

2200
01:47:27,373 --> 01:47:30,873
We believe it's the absolute
best way to teach everyone

2201
01:47:30,877 --> 01:47:35,447
to code, combining the powerful
Swift programming language

2202
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:39,588
and the powerful
capabilities of iPad.

2203
01:47:39,585 --> 01:47:44,125
To show it to you, I'd like
to invite Cheryl Thomas up.

2204
01:47:44,123 --> 01:47:45,493

Thank you, Tim.

I am thrilled to show
you Swift Playgrounds,

2208
01:47:54,133 --> 01:47:55,933
an incredible new app

2209
01:47:55,935 --> 01:47:58,235
that transforms how
kids learn to code.

2210
01:47:58,237 --> 01:48:01,277
I'll launch it right now.

2211
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:05,045
We land on this gorgeous
screen full

2212
01:48:05,044 --> 01:48:06,944
of custom content from Apple.

2213
01:48:06,946 --> 01:48:11,916
Up at the top are lessons and
down below we have challenges.

2214
01:48:11,918 --> 01:48:14,488
I'm going to start with
the very first lesson

2215
01:48:14,487 --> 01:48:17,787
in the Fundamentals of Swift.

2216
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:20,490
We see a preview of the
content with graphics

2217
01:48:20,493 --> 01:48:24,133
and a description
and I'll open it.

2218
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:26,130
It starts with an introduction

2219
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:29,432
to the coding concept I'll
be learning and when I'm good

2220
01:48:29,435 --> 01:48:32,975
and ready, I can just tap in the
lower corner to start coding.

2221
01:48:32,972 --> 01:48:37,912
Over on the right, you can see
we have an interactive world

2222
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:41,310
that I can explore using touch.

2223
01:48:41,314 --> 01:48:45,084
I'll swipe it, looks
good, and pinch to zoom.

2224
01:48:45,084 --> 01:48:46,954
This is Byte.

2225
01:48:46,953 --> 01:48:49,323
He is my character.

2226
01:48:49,322 --> 01:48:51,362
I think he's irresistible.

2227
01:48:51,357 --> 01:48:55,027
And I'll be controlling
him with code.

2228
01:48:55,027 --> 01:48:58,467
Over on the left are
instructions that explain

2229
01:48:58,464 --> 01:49:01,904
and help guide me through
the problem I'll be solving

2230
01:49:01,901 --> 01:49:03,941
and down below is
where I enter my code.

2231
01:49:03,936 --> 01:49:08,776
Byte has been waiting patiently
so I'll tap to enter Swift code.

2232
01:49:08,774 --> 01:49:12,914
You can see commands have
appeared at the bottom.

2233
01:49:12,912 --> 01:49:17,452
These are just like QuickType
suggestions but for code,

2234
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:20,250
my objective in this lesson
is to get him to the end

2235
01:49:20,252 --> 01:49:22,252
of that path and
collect the gem.

2236
01:49:22,254 --> 01:49:27,794
So I'll tap move forward three
times and then collect gem.

2237
01:49:27,793 --> 01:49:31,133
Watch the world on the
right as I run my code.

the exact order I've entered,

completed my very first lesson.

Now, I can continue to the
next lesson in the series

2244
01:49:51,183 --> 01:49:54,223
or I can jump around
to wherever I'd like.

2245
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:57,090
To do that, I tap in the
top left to open the table

2246
01:49:57,089 --> 01:50:00,729
of contents and you can
see we include a ton

2247
01:50:00,726 --> 01:50:05,466
of great content here to
engage and motivate learners.

2248
01:50:05,464 --> 01:50:08,464
This one on loops,
looping all the sides,

2249
01:50:08,467 --> 01:50:09,607
looks a little interesting.

2251

Now we have a few lines
of code already filled in.

2252

it and see what happens.

then he just stops.

Poor little guy.

01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:29,987
He's going to need some help.

2257
01:50:29,989 --> 01:50:32,859
The solution here, and I
know you've all got this,

2258
01:50:32,858 --> 01:50:35,998
is that I need to repeat
that block of code four times

2259
01:50:35,995 --> 01:50:39,095
to get Byte around all
four sides of the world.

2260
01:50:39,098 --> 01:50:41,798
To do that, I'm going
to need a for loop.

2261
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:46,101
I'll tap the plus up top to open
my code library and all I have

2262
01:50:46,105 --> 01:50:51,315
to do is just drag a for
loop right into my code.

2263
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:52,340
Now watch this.

2264
01:50:52,344 --> 01:50:55,214
I can tap that loop,
grab the end of it

2265
01:50:55,214 --> 01:50:58,554
and just drag it
all around my code.

repeat four times.

OK. Keep your eyes on
Byte as I run my code.

2271
01:51:14,033 --> 01:51:17,803
He moves forward, gets the gem,
makes a turn, and this time

2272
01:51:17,803 --> 01:51:20,843
with the added for loop,
he just keeps ongoing.

2273

lesson and I'm well

2274
01:51:24,076 --> 01:51:26,346

is a lot more sophisticated

fling them around.

is physics emoji,

they create a nice
little reaction.

just falling down to the bottom.

not gravity is fixed.

So, this is the first
computer that I coded on.

2366
01:56:08,227 --> 01:56:11,727
In the beginning, my biggest
challenge was not having access

01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:13,070
to a computer.

2368
01:56:13,065 --> 01:56:16,105
The first line of code
I wrote was bouncing ball.

2369
01:56:16,101 --> 01:56:18,201
It would bounce around
the screen, hit the edges

2370
01:56:18,203 --> 01:56:19,503
and then come back again.

01:56:19,505 --> 01:56:21,005
I think the first one was

2372
01:56:21,006 --> 01:56:24,006
like a to-do list,
it was a to-do list.

2373

I remember the first
time I did it when it worked

2374
01:56:26,879 --> 01:56:28,649
and it was like magical.

In Beirut we experience

So let me see if I can
just do a simple algorithm

2379

that can provide the
electricity cutoff time.

even know code at all,

some simple Swift code,

all comes from that first step.
