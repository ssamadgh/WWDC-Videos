/* When set to "1" ImageBrowserItemLayer defers image loading to a

#define USE_SHADOW_PATH 1

/* When set to "1" ImageBrowserItemLayer draws each image into its
   backing store, i.e. shrinks the image to its displayed size, rather
   than setting the image directly as its contents property. In this
   mode shadows are drawn into the layer's backing store using Core
   Graphics instead of using the CALayer shadows. */

/* When set to "1" ImageBrowserView sets the opaque property of each
   item view to YES. Only has an effect when DOWNSAMPLE_IMAGES=1. */

#define OPAQUE_ITEM_VIEWS 1

/* When set non-zero, the scroller will progressively fade out its top
   and bottom edges. When set to "1", does that setting the CALayer
   'mask' property to a view containing two gradient layers, when set
   to "2", does that by compositing two gradient layers over the
   scroller contents. */
