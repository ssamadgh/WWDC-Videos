Just imagine what this new

00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,886

199
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,251
Whatever it is, I'm sure that

200
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,490
it's going to change the world.

201
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,025
At Apple, changing the world and

202
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:44,891
making it a better place is what

203
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,460
it's all about for us.

204
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,129
We aim to put the customer at

205
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,597
the center of everything that we

206
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,027
do.

207
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,501
That's why, together with you,

208
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,100
the developer community, we're

209
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:00,472
working hard to provide new and

210
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:02,242
better experiences for our

211

And these experiences of course

are expressed through our four

Today is all about software, and

217
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,127
we've got some very exciting

We're going to get started with

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,560
iOS.

222
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,964
IOS embodies our philosophy of

223
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,235
putting the customer at the

224
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,033
center of everything that we

225
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:31,675
design.

226
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,470
Every year, we deliver a major

00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,413
iOS update that brings awesome

To tell you all about what we

231
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,515
had planned for this year, I'd

All right.

239
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,834
The next release of iOS is, you

240
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,504
guessed it, iOS 12.

241
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,404
Now, our customers, of course,

242
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,047
are going to receive iOS 12 as a

243
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,313
free software update.

244
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,481
Now, it's easy to forget now,

245
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,520
but iOS pioneered this approach

246
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,816
of helping you get more out of

247
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,757
the device you already own

248
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,252
through free updates.

249
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,124
And some of those updates have

250
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,321
been really quite profound.

251
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,123

252
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,125
whole new way to discover and

IOS 11 supports devices that

00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,831
were introduced as far back as

274
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,673

00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,168
Now if this is all we'd done in

388
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,394
iOS 12, I think it would be a

389
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,068
great release, but we've done

390
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,967
more.

391
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,068
Much more.

392
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,239
And we have a lot to cover

393
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:08,136
today, and it starts with

394
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,279
augmented reality.

395
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,044
Yeah. [applause and cheering]

396
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:15,351
Now AR is transformational

397
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,347
technology.

398
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,318
By bringing experiences into the

399
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,086
real world, it enables all kinds

400
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,486
of new experiences, changing the

401
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,587
way we have fun and the way we

402
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,259
work, and in iOS 12, we wanted

403
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,658
to make an easy way to

404
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,430
experience AR across the system,

405
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,069
and to do that, we got together

406
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,664
with some of the greatest minds

407
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,036
in 3D at Pixar, and together we

408
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,406
created a new file format for

409
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,205
AR.

410
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,346
It's called USDZ, and it's a

411
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,841
compact, single-file format

412
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,014
that's optimized for sharing

413
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,483
while retaining great 3D

414
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,281
graphics and even animations.

415
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:55,053
Now, you can use USDZ across the

416
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,153
system from the files app, to

417
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,055
Safari, even sharing them over

418
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,857
messages and mail, and what's

419
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,499
great is you can place these 3D

420
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,894
objects into the real world.

421
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,796
It's something that's like AR

422
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,668
quick look.

423
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,365
It's really awesome.

424
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,837
Now, we want all kinds of

425
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,336
creatives to be able to create

426
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,508
content for AR, and so we're

427
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,537
working with the leading

428
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,311
companies for 3D tools and 3D

429
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,210
libraries to bring their support

430
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,053
for USDZ.

431
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,118
Now one company that's been all

432
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:29,557
in on USDZ and ARKit is Adobe,

433
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,724
and to tell you about what

434
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,952
they're up to, I'd like to

435
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,896
invite Abhay Parasnis, their

436
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,032
CTO, to the stage.

437
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,497
Abhay.

438
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:41,035
[ Applause ]

439
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:41,862
Thanks Craig.

440
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,806
It's great to be here this morn.

441
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,004
So at Adobe we believe augmented

442
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,946
reality is an incredibly

443
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,041
important technology.

444
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,743
And with ARKit, Apple is by far

445
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,646
the most powerful platform for

446
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,348
AR.

447
00:16:58,349 --> 00:16:59,819
So earlier Craig talked about

448
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,558
USDZ format.

449
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,753
It's actually a pretty big deal.

450
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:05,854
There is now a way to deliver AR

451
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,297
experiences across the entire

452
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,333
iOS experience.

453
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:13,268
And so today we are actually

454
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:15,334
announcing that we are going to

455
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,603
bring native USDZ support to

456
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,472
Adobe's Creative Cloud.

457
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,371
[ Applause ]

458
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:26,074
With Creative Cloud, designers

459
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,047
and developers will now be able

460
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,646
to use familiar apps, apps that

461
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:31,848
they know and love, like

462
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,850
Photoshop or Dimension, to

463
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,422
create amazing AR content and

464
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,561
bring it easily via USDZ.

465
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:41,496
And of course, we are not going

466
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,893
to stop there.

467
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,334
We are going to bring the power

468
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,169
of immersive design to Creative

469
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,704
Cloud with a new set of services

470
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
and applications including a

471
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,072
brand-new iOS application that's

472
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,311
going to let all of you design

473
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,046
amazing AR experiences quickly.

474
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,442
So, you will be able to bring in

475
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:04,145
images, videos, text, any object

476
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,519
from Creative Cloud directly

477
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,358
into a native AR environment.

478
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,654
In fact, for the first time with

479
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:14,056
Creative Cloud and iOS, you will

480
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,358
have a what you see is what you

481
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,861
get editing in AR.

482
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,033
It's pretty cool.

483
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,501
So, come join this afternoon

484
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,703
State of the Union where we're

485
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:28,204
able to give you a sneak peak of

some of these new immersive

487
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,877
design tools for the first time.

Thank you, Abhay.

491
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,517
[applause] Now a critical part

492
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,788
of enabling AR is accurate

493
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,727
measurement, and fortunately the

494
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,922
precise calibration of sensors

495
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,025
in iOS devices and our tight

496
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,997
hardware software integration

497
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,435
mean that we do this really

498
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,030
well, and we want to enable

499
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,772
everyone to take advantage of

500
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,067
this capability.

501
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:59,838
So we're introducing a new app,

502
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,307
and it's called Measure.

503
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,446
It makes it really easy to

504
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,141
measure objects, detect

505
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,343
rectangles and get their

506
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,144
dimensions, and measure lines

507
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,816
along surfaces, and I'd like to

508
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,844
show it to you now.

509
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:15,758
[applause] Now, in looking for

510
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,293
something to measure, I ended up

511
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,729
digging through the attic and

512
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:24,896
came upon my old suitcase from

513
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,766
my traveling days in college.

514
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,265
A lot of memories in here.

515
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,368
Now I'm actually in the Measure

516
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,470
app, and you see I can easily

517
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:37,412
measure along this suitcase by

518
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:41,718
just tapping and dragging out a

519
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,113
line, like that, and check that

520
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:44,985
out.

521
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,723
It's a measurement.

522
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,022
[applause] Now, what's really

523
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,861
cool is I can extend these

524
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:55,056
measurements so I can just tap,

525
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,129
drag along another edge just

526
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,928
like that, and even take it into

527
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:03,671
full 3D by dragging down to the

528
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,238
bottom like that.

529
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,506
Isn't that cool?

530
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:11,374
[ Applause ]

531
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,306
Now I mentioned that we could

532
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,310
automatically detect rectangles

533
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,682
and show you dimensions of

534
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,550
objects.

535
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,317
So I have a photo here actually.

536
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,686
It's one my mom always wanted me

537
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,524
to travel with of me as a baby,

538
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,160
and so, you see, what I can do

539
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,757
with Measure is it automatically

540
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,129
detects the dimensions of that

541
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:29,927
photo.

542
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,027
I can just tap and get, oh,

543
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,401
yeah, a cute little baby, wasn't

544
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,199
I?

545
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,769
And you can get measurements

546
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,467
just like that.

547
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,537
It's really fantastic.

[ Applause ]

549
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,079
Now, I'd like to turn now to

550
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,415
USDZ and its support throughout

551
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,311
the system.

552
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,882
You know, you can experience

553
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
USDZ in so many places, and one

554
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:52,251
of those places is news.

555
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,480
Now here's an article.

556
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:54,524
We're all accustomed to seeing

557
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,219
images in news articles.

558
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,690
But check this out.

559
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,529
Here you see a USDZ asset.

560
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,654
It can just tap on this little

561
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:03,498
3D control and jump right in and

562
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:04,224
experience it.

563
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,128
You can see the amazing

564
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,929
animations that are possible,

565
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:07,831
and of course it's fully

566
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,232
interactive.

567
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:12,873
So I can zoom in and pan.

568
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,040
Isn't that amazing?

569
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,549
[applause] Now USDZ is also

570
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,645
great in the web.

571
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,146
So here I am at the Fender

572
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:24,447
website and actually let you

573
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,819
configure your guitar with the

574
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,147
kind of finish and pickguard

575
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:27,981
that you want.

576
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,625
So I can select a configuration

577

option here, and then I can see

578
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,859
the guitar I've configured.

579
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,327
So I'm just going to tap in.

580
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:36,265
Of course I can see the guitar

581
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,860
here, but wouldn't it be cool if

582
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,432
I could see it in the real world

583
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,630
in its real size?

584
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,402
Well, there it is.

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,230
Check that out.

586
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,034

00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:51,705
capture that for posterity.

588
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,749
And that's a quick look at USDZ

589

and Measure in iOS 12.

590
00:21:57,448 --> 00:22:00,118
Next-- thank you.

[applause] Next, I'd like to

592
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,790
talk about the key technology

593
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,559
behind these augmented reality

594
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,227
experiences, and that's ARKit.

595
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,127
ARKit opens up the world of AR

596
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,029
to hundreds of millions of

597
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,000
users, making it the world's

598
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,839
largest AR platform by far.

599
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:20,806
And we're on a relentless pace

600
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:22,645
of advancement with AR, and that

601
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,780
continues today with ARKit 2.

602
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:31,518
Yes. ARKit 2 delivers advances

603
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,656
with improved face tracking,

604
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,491
more realistic rendering, and

605
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:38,156
support for 3D object detection

606
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,956
and persistence, which enables

613
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:52,605
foundation for a lesson that was

authored in AR.

615

Now, check out how both players

628
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,432
and even a third observer can

629
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:21,671
all experience the same

labs over the last couple of

636
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,752
weeks to work with ARKit, and

they love it.

Now, one of them is Lego.

expand those creative

physical and digital together to

659
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,125
really open up those creative

00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,996
play possibilities, because our

661
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,665
Lego sets are really the start

662
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:26,733

could take things even further?

766
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:36,387
Perfect, we did it.

767
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:38,487
Yeah. What?

768
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:42,429
[ Applause ]

769
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,296
And we've even unlocked a new

770
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,465
item for our collection.

771
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,634
But the fun doesn't need to end

772
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:50,201
there because with ARKit 2, we

773
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,401
get to save our entire world

774
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:56,144
back into our physical set and

775
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,380
pick up where we left off.

776
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,047
[applause] All right.

777
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:01,745
That's awesome.

778
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,816
So much fun.

779
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:05,214
But what makes this truly

780
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,886
amazing is how with just a

781
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:09,424
single Lego creation and ARKit 2

782
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,490
it really opens up those

783
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,558
creative play possibilities.

784
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,396
So look out for more Lego AR

785
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,391
experiences in the App Store

786
00:28:16,393 --> 00:28:17,233
later this year.

787
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,458
Thank you very much everybody.

788
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:22,162
[ Applause ]

789
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,906
Isn't that great?

790
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,871
So that's our update on AR and

791
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,100
iOS 12.

792
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,804
Next, I'd like to turn to

793
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:29,836
Photos.

794
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,540
You know, over a trillion photos

795
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,613
are captured on iPhone each

796
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:38,552
year, and Photos is the best way

797
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,049
to relive and share those

798
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,521
moments.

799
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,050
This year we're making photos

800
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,894
even better, and it starts with

801
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,020
Search.

802
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,194
Search has powerful object and

803
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,593
scene recognition.

804
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:51,764
It lets you search for photos

805
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,102
based on things like searching

806
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,697
for cars or dogs or flowers, and

807
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:56,839
that's a great way to explore

808
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,474
your library, but in iOS 12,

809
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,370
Search now starts working for

810
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,212
you even before you start typing

811
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,148
with Search suggestions.

812
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,413
It'll highlight things for you

813
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,811
like key moments and people that

814
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,984
are important to you, places

815
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,152
where you've taken some great

816
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,450
photos and even categories of

817
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,721
photos like hiking and water

818
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,560
sports.

819
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,455
And Search is much more powerful

820
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:20,326
than ever.

821
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,624
You can search for places by

822
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,495
business name.

823
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:23,663
So you could search for SFMOMA

824
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,131
or even a broad category like

825
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,460
museum.

826
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:30,464
And, Photos indexes over four

827
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,307
million events by time and

828
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,133
place.

829
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:34,507
Things like sporting events and

830
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,005
concerts, and so you can search

831
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,706
for them and find photos you

832
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,448
took at those events.

833
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,213
And search is super powerful.

834
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,312
You can now search for multiple

835
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,483
search terms like surfing and

836
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,821
vacation and even get

837
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:47,716
suggestions for additional

838
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:49,188
search terms to help you find

839
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,956
exactly what you're looking for.

840
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,795
And now in iOS 12 we have an all

841
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,860
new tab.

842
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,898
It's called For You.

843
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:58,163
And with For You, you have all

844
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,392
of your memories, so those great

845
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,636
memory movies, but more like

846
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,502
featured photos highlighting a

847
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,640
photo that you took on this day

848
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,106
in past years.

849
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,504
And Effects Suggestions, for

850
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:11,106
instance, suggesting looping a

851
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:14,008
live photo or applying a new

852
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,651
portrait effect to one of your

853
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,986
portrait photos.

854
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,281
And we even highlight your

855
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,552
shared album activity.

856
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,251
Now when it comes to sharing,

857
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,253
there are many ways you can

858
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,554
share photos, but our focus is

859
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,556
on sharing great photos with the

860
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:29,628
people you care about most, and

861
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,367
that's why this year in For You

862
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,732
we've added Sharing Suggestions.

863
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,631
So imagine you've gone out for a

864
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,863
great dinner with some friends

865
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:38,107
and you took some photos.

866
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,042
Well afterwards in For You,

867
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:41,437
you'll see a suggestion like

868
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:42,908
this to share those photos.

869
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,047
If you tap in, you'll see that

870
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,512
photos is even recommending a

871
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:50,111
set of photos from that set that

872
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,214
you might want to share and

873
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:53,686
suggest who you might want to

874
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,684
share them with based in part by

875
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,056
the people that appeared in the

876
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:57,954
photos.

877
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:59,185
And when you share them, they're

878
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,229
shared at full resolution out of

879
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:04,525
your iCloud photo library and

880
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:05,528
when you're friend receives

881
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,229
them, something really magical

882
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:08,001
happens.

883
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,298
Their phone searches their

884
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,800
libraries for other photos they

885
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,541
took at that event and suggest

886
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,876
that they share them back to

887
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,741
you, so you both can end up with

888
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:16,509
a full set.

889
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:23,047
[ Applause ]

890
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,317
Now this is built around

891
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,485
iMessage so of course it's

892
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:26,852
private, using end-to-end

893
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,790
encryption, and all of those

894
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,886
smarts are done with on-device

895
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,088
machine learning.

896
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,859
So that's your quick update on

897
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:37,127
Photos in iOS 12, and next,

898
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,127
let's turn to Siri.

899
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,969
Now Siri is by far the world's

900
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,235
most used digital assistant with

901
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,173
over 10 billion requests

902
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,239
processed per month, and because

903
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:48,807
Siri works across all your

904
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,876
devices, it's always there to

905
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:51,974
help you through your day

906
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,776
getting things done.

907
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:56,277
Now we all know that Siri works

908
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,320
with many third-party apps for

909
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,315
things like messaging, ride

910
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,587
sharing, and payments.

911
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,926
But we wanted to make Siri able

912
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,921
to do much more for you, and

913
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,493
we're doing that by taking

914
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,331
advantage of the power of apps

915
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,096
with a new feature we call

916
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,525
Shortcuts.

917
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,569
Now with shortcuts any app can

918
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,265
expose quick actions to Siri.

919
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,107
Let's look at some examples.

920
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,743
Now say you have the Tile app

921
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,108
because you're always losing

922
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,306
your keys.

923
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,247
Well, the Tile app can expose

924
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,442
the option to add a shortcut to

925
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:28,244
Siri.

926
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:30,245
And you can assign your own

927
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,217
phrase, such as I lost my keys

928
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,586
would be a good choice, and when

929
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,024
you then say it, Siri will

930
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,860
automatically activate Tile and

931
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,256
show you right in the Siri UI

932
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:42,097
start ringing your Tile just

933
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:42,722
like that.

934
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:43,696
It's really great.

935
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:44,524
[applause]

936
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:48,128
[ Applause ]

937
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,702
Of course there's so many uses

938
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,630
for this kind of thing.

939
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,304
You could say game time to get

940
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:53,872
your team's schedule from

941
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,211
TeamSnap or help me relax to

942
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:58,506
kick off a meditation or order

943
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,709
my groceries to order your

944
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:01,581
usual.

945
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:03,878
You know, with millions of apps,

946
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,521
Shortcut enables incredible

947
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,056
possibilities for how you use

948
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,121
Siri.

949
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:10,718
Now, as you know, Siri is more

950
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:11,551
than just a voice.

951
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:12,925
Siri is working all the time in

952
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:14,363
the background to make proactive

953
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,258
suggestions for you even before

954
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,160
you ask, and now with Shortcut,

955
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,034
Siri can do so much more.

956
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,402
So, for instance, let's say you

957
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,040
order a coffee every morning at

958
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:27,105
Phil's before you go to work.

959
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,844
Well now, Siri can suggest right

960
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,339
on your lock screen that you do

961
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,180
that.

962
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,705
You tap on it, and you can place

963
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,179
the order right from there.

964
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,749
Or if when you get to the gym

965
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,117
you use Active to track

966
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:40,155
workouts, well that suggestion

967
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,690
will appear right on your lock

968
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:42,515
screen.

969
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,459
And this even works when you

970
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,884
pull down into Search.

971
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,328
You'll get great suggestions.

972
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,893
Like say you're running late for

973
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,361
a meeting, well Siri will

974
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,959
suggest you text the meeting

975
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:51,761
organizer.

976
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:54,032
Or when you go to the movie,

977
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,631
suggest that you turn on Do Not

978
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:56,472
Disturb.

979
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,307
That's just being considerate.

980
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,042
And remind you to call grandma

981
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:01,838
on her birthday.

982
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,309
Just tap, and it'll dial the

983
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,807
call for you.

984
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,248
Now, we think we're all going to

985
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:08,683
really enjoy using Shortcuts,

986
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,319
and so we went a step further.

987
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,584
We wanted to let you create your

988
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,222
own shortcuts as users, multiple

989
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,589
steps across multiple

990
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,727
applications, and we're doing it

991
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,162
with a new Shortcuts app.

992
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,699
So with the Shortcuts app, you

993
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,834
could do something like create a

994
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,999
shortcut for surf time, and it

995
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,138
could go get you the surf

996
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,933
report, look up the current

997
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,074
weather, get you the ETA to the

998
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,400
beach, and even create a

999
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:35,744
reminder for you to put on

1000
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,809
sunscreen when you get there.

1001
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,548
Now, it's all done with simple

1002
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:43,014
drag and drop steps in the

1003
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,753
Shortcuts editor right here.

1004
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,119
It's really easy.

1005
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:48,457
Now to show you how Shortcuts

1006
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:50,092
can streamline your day, I'd

1007
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:50,917
like to invite one of our

1008
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,961

1011
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,226
you a live demo.

1012
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:57,657
Kim.

1013
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:58,531
Hey!

1014
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:05,539
[ Applause ]

1015
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,506
I'm am so stoked to show you

1016
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:08,674
Siri Shortcuts.

1017
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,702
To do that, I'm going to walk

1018
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:10,846
you through my day.

1019
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,011
So imagine it's the morning.

1020
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,339
I'm headed to work, and I pick

1021
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,613
up my phone, and I see this

1022
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,682
suggestion from Phil's Coffee.

1023
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,121
Siri has learned that I do this

1024
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,716
most mornings, so now I can just

1025
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:22,917
tap on the suggestion and I see

1026
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,050
all the details I need to

1027
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,024
confirm my perfect Mint Monkey

1028
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,293
Dough right here on the lock

1029
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,591
screen without even going into

1030
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:29,362
the app.

1031
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,999
So let's get caffeinated.

1032
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:33,794
And I'm done.

1033
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:36,637
Fast forward a little bit, and

1034
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,003
I'm sitting at my desk at my

1035
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,241
office and I need to know when

1036
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:40,506
my next meeting is.

1037
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:41,704
I'll go to the Up Next widget,

1038
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,645
and it looks like I am running a

1039
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,840
little late for a rather

1040
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,781
important meeting, so I should

1041
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,417
probably let someone know.

1042
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,842
And it looks like Shortcuts is a

1043
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:50,886
few steps ahead of me.

1044
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,181
I could call into the meeting,

1045
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:53,652
or I could let the organizer

1046
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,150
know that I am running late.

1047
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,222
I should probably tell Arie

1048
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,590
what's up.

1049
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,558
That looks like just what I want

1050
00:35:58,555 --> 00:36:01,695
to say, sorry Arie, let's send

1051
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,392
it.

1052
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:05,893
Perfect. I also want to show you

1053
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,666
how you can add a shortcut to

1054
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:08,494
Siri.

1055
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:09,868
So let's take a look at Kayak.

1056
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:12,706
I keep all of my travel details

1057
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,533
in Kayak.

1058
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:15,207
Most important is my post WWDC

1059
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,275
relaxation trip to Los Angeles.

1060
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,875
You can see I have got my

1061
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,716
flight, my hotel, all the

1062
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,312
details, everything I need, but

1063
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:24,783
what I really want is to be able

1064
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,051
to use this and get to this

1065
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,849
information with my voice while

1066
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,121
I'm on the go.

1067
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,219
So, let's head back, and I can

1068
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:33,991
just tap add to Siri, record my

1069
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,931
custom phrase, travel plans

1070
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:40,527
[beep], and I'm done.

1071
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,770
So now when I land at the

1072
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:44,436
airport and I'm about to get in

1073
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:45,974
a cab and I could really use

1074
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,839
that hotel address, I can just

1075
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,508
say, travel plans.

1076
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,349
Kayak says your hotel is at

1077
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,714
929 South Broadway.

1078
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,253
You can check in after 3 p.m.

1079
00:36:58,248 --> 00:36:59,748
Isn't that cool?

1080
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,450
[applause] It's pretty cool.

1081
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:06,991
[ Applause ]

1082
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,090
So I would love to be on that

1083
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:09,391
vacation, but I should, I don't

1084
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,033
know, probably finish this demo,

1085
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,028
so let's head back to work, and

1086
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,230
I can show you how the Shortcut

1087
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,671
app can help me with my commute

1088
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,066
home.

1089
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,808
We start in the Gallery where

1090
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,073
there's hundreds of premade

1091
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,971
shortcuts that you can download,

1092
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:23,903
or we can hop over to the

1093
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,407
library, and I've got a bunch of

1094
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,509
shortcuts here, but I want to

1095
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,710
show you my heading home

1096
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:28,911
shortcut.

1097
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:31,212
You can see that it's just

1098
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:32,754
really a series of steps.

1099
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:34,519
It grabs my location and travel

1100
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,558
time, and it sends my ETA to my

1101
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,023
roommate.

1102
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,521
It sets my HomeKit thermostat to

1103
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,993
70 degrees, and it turns on my

1104
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:41,961
fan.

1105
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,328
And last, it gets directions

1106
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,597
home with Apple maps with the

1107
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:46,364
best route to avoid traffic.

1108
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,633
Now this is already pretty cool,

1109
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,802
but I happen to be an NPR News

1110
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,401
junkie, so I should probably

1111
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:53,742
just add that to my shortcut to

1112
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:55,037
save me some trouble on the ride

1113
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:55,868
home.

1114
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,142
Let's tap search, and there's a

1115
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,681
bunch I can add here, but I can

1116
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:02,046
just tap Siri suggestions, and

1117
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:04,185
there it is, play KQED Radio,

1118
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,181
we'll drag this in, drop it, and

1119
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,884
we're set.

1120
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:10,385
I've already added the shortcut

1121
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:12,087
to Siri with a custom phrase,

1122
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,389
heading home, so now, whenever I

1123
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,791
leave work, I can just say,

1124
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:18,163
heading home.

1125
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:22,531

1141
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:56,802
of course you can run your

so great to be here.

1154
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,054
I'm excited to tell you about

our most popular apps, starting

1157
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:28,332
with one of my favorites, News.

1158
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:32,001
So News is a personalized feed

where you can see all the

collection of curated content.

discover new channels and

easier to jump to your favorites

1170

We've added a new sidebar, and

1174
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,435
it's a great way to navigate.

1175
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,839
It makes it easy and I fun to

dig into the areas you're most

00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:15,684
interested in.

1282
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:53,759
take a moment to talk about

1283
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:55,203
something that's on a lot of

1284

but some apps demand more of our

1290
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,652
attention than we might even

1291
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:12,387
realize.

00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,150
when we really should be

1294
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,221

00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:16,989
something else.

1296
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:18,326
They send us flurries of

1298
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,060
in for fear of missing out.

1299
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,629
And some of us, it's become such

1300
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:26,968
a habit that, you know, we might

1301
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,503
not even recognize just how

1302
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,598
distracted we've become.

1303
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Well, we've thought deeply about

1304
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:34,942
this, and today we're announcing

distraction, focus, and

1308
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:44,312
understand how you're spending

1309
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,914
your time and balance the many

1310
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,986
things that are important to

1311
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:48,854

times when you just don't want

1316

to be disturbed, and one of

1317
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,628
those, of course, is at night.

1318
00:44:58,628 --> 00:44:59,558
Sometimes you wake up in the

1319
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:00,562
middle of the night, and you

1320
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:01,533
look at your phone, maybe just

1321
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:02,831
to check the time, and you're

1322
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:03,872
confronted with something like

1323
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,667
this, a barrage of notifications

1324
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:08,209
that spin you up and keep you

1325
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:10,274
from falling back asleep.

1326
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:12,413
And so we're introducing Do Not

1327
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:14,608
Disturb during bedtime where all

1328
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,981
you'll see is this.

1329
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,620
Nothing to get you spun up.

1330
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,485
And in the morning, yeah.

1331
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:26,493
[ Applause ]

1332
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:27,959
In the morning when you wake up,

1333
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:29,397
you're gently eased into your

1334
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:30,192
day.

1335
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:31,023
You can tap when you want to

1336
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,097
start confronting those

1337
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,965
notifications.

1338
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,064
Now we've all found ourselves in

1339
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:40,936
situations like this.

1340
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,277
[laughter] Now, rest assured, he

1341
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,442
stuck the landing on this one.

1342
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,540
But now Do Not Disturb can help,

1343
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,744
and we made it easier than ever

1344
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,945
to use Do Not Disturb because

1345
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,346
now we have a great new mode

1346
00:45:51,347 --> 00:45:52,487
where when you press in to Do

1347
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:54,652
Not Disturb and Control Center,

1348
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,051
you can set an ending time for

1349
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:56,982
Do Not Disturb for when you

1350
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:58,686
leave a particular location or

1351
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,028
when an event ends on your

1352
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:00,853
calendar.

1353
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:01,657
So I think we're all going to be

1354
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,158
using Do Not Disturb a bunch

1355
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,059
more.

1356
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,030
Now next I want to talk about

1357
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,669
Notifications.

1358
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,534
Now, Notifications help keep us

1359
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:11,703
informed and connected to

1360
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,241
important things that happen

1361
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:15,376
throughout the day, and we'd

1362
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:16,771
like to give you more control

1363
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,073
over how many notifications you

1364
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:21,415
receive, and so we're enabling

1365
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,951
what we call Instant Tuning for

1366
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,046
Notifications right from the

1367
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,417
lock screen.

1368
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,545
You can press in to a

1369
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,049
notification, and from there,

1370
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,321
you can decide to send future

1371
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,219
notifications from that app

1372
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,651
directly to Notifications

00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:33,955
Center, bypassing your lock

Or turn them off altogether, and

1376
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:37,926
Siri will even help by

suggesting that you turn off

1378
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,029
Notifications for apps that

1379
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,830
you're no longer using.

1380
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:44,632
Now, we also wanted to give you

1381
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,434
help managing large numbers of

1382
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,636
notifications.

1383
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,237
So I'm thrilled to announce that

1384
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,539
we're bringing to iOS support

1385
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,511
for grouped notifications.

[ Applause ]

1387
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:03,117
Notifications are grouped not

1388
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,619
just by app but also by topic

1389
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,692
and thread.

1390
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:08,089
It gives you a great overview of

1391
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:08,961
the notifications you've

1392
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:09,958
received.

1393
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,599
You can tap in and look at a

1394
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:12,634
particular group.

1395
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,069
But of course just as important

1396
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:17,104
with a single swipe, you can

1397
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,900
triage a whole group of

1398
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,302
notifications away.

1399
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:22,473

distractions, we wanted to go

1404
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:34,048
further, and it's with a feature

1405
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,550
we call screen time.

1406
00:47:36,552 --> 00:47:39,092
Screen time empowers you with

1407
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:41,358
both insight and control over

1408
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,527
how you spend your time, and it

1409
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:46,026
starts with reports.

1410
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,029
Every week, you get a weekly

1411
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,101
activity summary that details

1412
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,340
how you used your iPhone or

1413
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:54,536

00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,477
You tap in, and you get to view

your full activity report.

1416
00:47:58,942 --> 00:47:59,972
It's really detailed.

1417
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,446
You get deep insight on how much

1418
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:03,014
time you're spending, where

1419
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:04,612
you're spending it, and even how

1420
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:05,984
your use breaks down during the

1421
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:09,082
day or the night.

1422
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:10,785
You get a summary of the time

1423
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,927
you're spending in apps, how

1424
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:15,292
much time you're spending, how

1425
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,891
often per hour you're picking up

1426
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,093
your phone and what's drawing

1427
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,964
you in and what apps are sending

1428
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,404
you the most notifications.

1429
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:25,199
Now, equipped with this insight,

1430
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:26,901
you can make decisions about how

1431
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,303
much time you want to spend with

1433
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,043
But we know there are people who

1434
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,980
would like a little extra help

1435
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,916
in managing their use of apps,

1436
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,611
and for them we've created App

00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:37,652
Limits.

1438
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:39,917
So if in your activity report

1439
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,316
you see an app where you might

1440
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:42,247
want to be spending a little bit

1441
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:44,921
less time, well you can set your

1442
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,091
own limit, and then during the

1443
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,430
day, when you're using the app,

1444
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:50,255
you receive a helpful

1445
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:51,529

[ Applause ]

1448
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:03,038
And once you've reached your

1449
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:04,739
limit, instead of the app,

1450
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,071
you'll see this.

1451
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:07,645
It's time to move on.

1452
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:08,513
Now, we'll let you grant

1453
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,681
yourself and extension if you

1454
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,319
want, but we'll give you a

1455
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:12,984
reminder later to move along.

1456
00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:15,622
Now, this is also in sync across

1457
00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:16,918
your iPhone and iPad, so your

1458
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:18,719
limits apply to your total

1459
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:19,621
usage.

1460
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:20,492
And we think this is going to be

1461
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,630
helpful for many people, but

1462
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:26,196
especially for some kids.

1463
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,965
And we know this is something

1464
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,194
that can help families achieve

1465
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:31,198
the right balance for them.

1466
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,440
And of course it starts with

1467
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:33,805
providing your kids with great

1468
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:34,903

activity report of their own,

but as a parent, you get one as

well on your device, and based

1472
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,576
on what you see, you have the

1473
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,480

00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:58,399
One of them is downtime, time

00:49:58,394 --> 00:49:59,434
when you want your kids to

unplug altogether.

1479
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,330

And you can also limit your

1481
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:08,675
kids' time in apps by category

1482
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:11,041
or by individual app.

1483

Now, there's some apps you may

1484
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,648
want to always allow them to

1485
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:14,473
use.

1486
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:15,307
For instance, you may want them

1487
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:16,241
to be able to get at the phone

1488
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:17,515
at all times, so they can

1489
00:50:17,513 --> 00:50:18,313
contact you.

1490
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:19,314
Or you may want to give them

1491
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,355
access to educational apps.

1492
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,590
And you can also limit access to

1493
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:25,926
only movies, apps, and websites

1494

that you deem age appropriate.

to express ourselves with emoji

00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,241
things that make Animoji so fun

1514
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,707
is how expressive they are, you

1516
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,240
nods of the head and blinking of

1517
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,312

tracking our expressions.

1520

And this year, we're taking

00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,046
is.

1590
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,844
I recently chopped my hair, so I

1591
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:11,385
want one that matches the new

1593
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:13,985
So I've selected a skin color,

1594
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,323

1595
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,819

First, I'm going to grab my

1603
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,041
color, and then like I said, I

1604
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:36,536
need to go a little bit shorter.

1605

Nope, this is the one.

1608
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:44,611
course select my eye color, and

1609
00:54:44,613 --> 00:54:46,183

Yeah. Facetime is the way that

1695
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,177
so many of us connect with the

1696
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:01,715
people in our lives and share

1697
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,710
some of our most important

1698
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,481
moments, and it's helped us

1699
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
deepen our connect with people

1700
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:08,152
important to us wherever they

1701
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,050
are, and of course it's a fun

1702
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:11,852
place just to hang out.

1703
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:13,994
Now this year Facetime is going

1704
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:16,729
to take a big leap forward

1705
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:19,895
because today we're introducing

1706
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:22,465
Group Facetime.

1707
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:28,034
[ Applause ]

1708
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:31,077
Now, you'll be able to facetime

1709
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:34,943
with two people, three people,

1710
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:38,484
actually up to 32 simultaneous

1711
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,480
participants.

[ Applause ]

1713
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,159
Now, setting up a group call

1714
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,595
couldn't be easier.

1715
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,590
Just instead of typing one

1716
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,261
person's name, you can do many.

1717
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:51,529
You can ring them by tapping

1718
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:53,797
audio or video, but we also

1719
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,126
introduced a great new way

1720
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,430
because Facetime is now

1721
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,032
integrated into messages, so you

1722
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,234
can quickly go from a group chat

1723
00:59:01,236 --> 00:59:03,536
you have going directly into a

1724
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,679
group Facetime, and members of

1725
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:07,444
the group can join in and drop

1726
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,183
out at any time.

1727
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,478
It's really great.

1728
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,379
Would you like to see it?

1729
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,620
[applause] Well let's do a demo.

1730
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:16,755
[applause] Well I think for our

1731
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:19,592
first live demo of group

1732
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:22,128
Facetime, I'm going to contact

1733
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:23,794
the folks back in Cupertino.

1734
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,262
I can just dive in to this

1735
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,260
conversation I have going with

1736
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:28,502
the members of the Facetime

1737
00:59:28,497 --> 00:59:30,367
team, and it looks like actually

1738
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,196
they're already on a group

1739
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,940
Facetime call, so I'm just going

1740
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:39,946
to join right in.

1741
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,512
Hey everybody.

1742
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,510
Hey Craig.

1743
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:44,612
Check it out.

1744
00:59:44,613 --> 00:59:46,653
So it's this beautiful Facetime

1745
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,589
UI with these big gorgeous tiles

1746
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,155
right up front where you see

1747
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:52,423
some of the leaders of the

1748
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:53,791
Facetime team, and down at the

1749
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:55,559
bottom there's and area we call

1750
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:57,197
the roster that contains

1751
00:59:57,192 --> 00:59:58,032
everybody else.

1752
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,197
And of course I'm right there in

1753
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:01,134
the lower right-hand corner.

1754
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,200
Hey Craig.

1755
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:04,237
Wait, am I on the big screen?

1756
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,703
Yes, Lauren, this is not a

1757
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:06,631
test.

1758
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:08,405
You're in front of 6000 of your

1759
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:09,504
biggest new fans.

[ Applause ]

1761
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,611
Now, what you probably notice is

1762
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:19,153
when Lauren spoke, her tile

1763
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,988
automatically got larger to

1764
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:22,723
reflect her prominence in the

1765
01:00:22,718 --> 01:00:23,488
conversation.

1766
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:25,485
This is totally automatic.

1767
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:26,787
Hey Roberto, how's it going back

1768
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,359
there in Cupertino?

1769
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:30,457
I'd say it's going pretty

1770
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:32,199
well, and Lauren, sorry for

1771
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:34,164
stealing your spotlight.

1772
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,293
So this works of course for

1773
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:37,167
people in the roster as well.

1774
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,096
When they speak, they come

1775
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,930
forward.

01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:39,764

1777
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:40,598
make your big entrance?

01:00:40,602 --> 01:00:43,172
Finally, my moment has come.

1783
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:55,051

to share Group Facetime with

development of the watch many

1858

just how impactful and essential

1860

it could become in our lives, so

1861
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:24,964
we worked very hard to create

of them with you this morning.

1880
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,706
Mary Dovgen was boating with her

1881
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,908
husband, John, when due to a

1882
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,381
medical condition all of John's

1883
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,450
muscles went completely limp,

1884
01:04:13,448 --> 01:04:15,518
and he fell into the ice cold

1885
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:17,017
water.

1886
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,519
With her arms wrapped around

1887
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,220
John to keep him from drowning,

1888
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:23,993
Mary could not reach her phone

1889
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:26,432
to call for help.

1890
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:28,668
But with her Apple Watch, she

1891
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,404
was able to call Siri, or to use

1892
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,640
Siri to call 911, rescuers soon

1893
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:38,506
arrived, and saved John's live.

1894
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:42,647
[ Applause ]

1895
01:04:42,644 --> 01:04:45,414
As Mary told us, if it wasn't

1896
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,984
for my Apple Watch, he really

1897
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:50,723
would not be here today.

1898
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:52,189
This is just one of the many

1899
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:53,727
stories that we've heard about

1900
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,462
about how Apple Watch is

1901
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,557
impacting people's lives.

1902
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,429
They range from getting people

1903
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:00,968
to be more active, to helping

1904
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,503
users live a healthier life, or

1905
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:06,239
even to alerting users to an

1906
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:08,004
elevated heart rate.

1907
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:10,443
Apple Watch brings such amazing

1908
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,439
capabilities right to the wrist,

1909
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,712
and of course at the heart of

1910
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,550
this is watchOS.

1911
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,186
We're excited to introduce

1912
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,021
watchOS 5 today, which brings

1913
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:23,957
even more ways for you to stay

1914
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:26,892
active and connected, and I'd

1915
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:28,658
like to hand it off to Kevin

1916
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,497
Lynch to tell you all about it.

1917
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:31,492
Kevin.

1918
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:37,033
[ Applause ]

1919
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,262
Good morning.

1920
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:39,266
You know, stories like that,

1921
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:40,467
about how Apple Watch is

1922
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:41,569
supporting people around the

1923
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,110
world in even extreme situations

1924
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,436
like Mary and John's but also in

1925
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,940
their daily lives is really

1926
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:48,172
super motivating to us as a

1927
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:48,976
team.

1928
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,517
And there are things you do

1929
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:51,982
every day that shape your life.

1930
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,420
And Apple Watch has two

1931
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,546
[inaudible] working to help you

1932
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,050
support those activities every

1933
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:58,652
day.

1934
01:05:58,653 --> 01:05:59,823
First, staying active to

1935
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:00,921
increase your well-being and

1936
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:02,292
health and second being

1937
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,360
connected to the people and the

1938
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:04,498
information that you care most

1939
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,193
about, and we're moving watchOS

1940
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:08,364
in both of these areas.

1941
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:09,463
Let's start with health and

1942
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:10,604
fitness.

1943
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:11,529
Now much of the power in the

1944
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:12,663
health and fitness features that

1945
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:14,607
we've put in Watch are really

1946
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:15,903
empowered by the investment we

1947
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:18,004
do to make sure the data you see

1948
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:19,206
is accurate.

1949
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:20,347
The data from our custom-built

1950
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,172
heart rate sensor,

1951
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:23,416
Accelerometer, Gyro, GPS, are

1952
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,082
all thoroughly validated.

1953
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,720
In fact, from our fitness lab,

1954
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:28,385
we've studied over six terabytes

1955
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:30,453
of data where 12,000 study

1956
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:32,422
participants logged over 90,000

1957
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,451
hours of sessions.

1958
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:35,025
And they actually burned 2.3

1959
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:37,193
million calories doing this.

1960
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:38,432
We believe this is the largest

1961
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,857
biometric data collection of its

1962
01:06:39,861 --> 01:06:40,691
kind.

1963
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:42,895
And we take this information and

1964
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,028
we work to integrate this

1965
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:45,032
seamlessly with the user

1966
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:46,533
experience so when you raise

1967
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,605
your wrist and you look at your

1968
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:49,102
activity rings, the information

1969
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:50,134
is not only accurate, but it's

1970
01:06:50,138 --> 01:06:51,778
also meaningful to you.

1971
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:52,843
We really love hearing about

1972
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,241
your focus on closing these

1973
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:55,512
rings.

1974
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,580
And we really enable this

1975
01:06:56,578 --> 01:06:57,508
through a number of ways in

1976
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:58,852
Apple Watch.

1977
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,587
First, of course, we do daily

1978
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:01,652
coaching so you can see what

1979
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,390
your goals are for the day.

1980
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:04,755
We also support celebrations

1981
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:06,923
when you achieve your goals, and

1982
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:07,822
we have special edition

1983
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,423
challenges like the most recent

1984
01:07:09,424 --> 01:07:11,524
birthday challenge that we did.

1985
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,196
And on a monthly basis, we do

1986
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,125
monthly goals that are

1987
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,199
personalized to you.

1988
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,567
And of course the activity app

1989
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,306
also supports activity sharing,

1990
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,301
which has become one of the most

1991
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,942
popular features of the activity

1992
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:22,767
app.

1993
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:25,011
Many of you love the excitement

1994
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:26,046
of good old-fashioned

1995
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,481
competition though, so in

1996
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,376
watchOS 5, you can challenge any

1997
01:07:29,377 --> 01:07:30,917
of your activity-sharing friends

1998
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,282
to a seven-day competition

1999
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,120
whenever you would like.

2000
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,455
And if they accept, you each try

2001
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,990
to win the week by closing your

2002
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:38,285
rings and earning points.

2003
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:39,286
You earn one point for each

2004
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:40,087
percent of a ring that you

2005
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:40,918
close.

2006
01:07:40,922 --> 01:07:42,062
And while you're in the middle

2007
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:43,627
of a competition, your progress

2008
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,125
notifications are updated, do

2009
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,427
not only show you the progress

2010
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:47,558
your friends are making, but

2011
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:48,762
also where you stand in the

2012
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:50,033
competition.

2013
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:52,871
And when you win, you receive a

2014
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:53,898
new award.

2015
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:55,002
We're really excited about this

2016
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:55,803
edition, and if you're

2017
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:56,604
competition, it gives you a

2018
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:57,935
whole new way to enjoy the

2019
01:07:57,939 --> 01:07:59,839
activity app.

2020
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:01,481
Now when you're doing

2021
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:06,911
[applause]-- now when you do

2022
01:08:06,915 --> 01:08:07,745
want to go do a workout, there's

2023
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:08,819
a lot of workout types you can

2024
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:10,587
choose from, and they all have

2025
01:08:10,585 --> 01:08:11,825
custom algorithms to measure

2026
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,390
things like calorie burn, pace,

2027
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:15,158
distance, elevation gain, and

2028
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,027
when you're swimming, it even

2029
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:17,364
counts laps and detects which

2030
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,689
swim strokes you're using.

2031
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,333
And with Gym Kit, your metrics

2032
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:21,698
are in sync with your favorite

2033
01:08:21,696 --> 01:08:22,566
gym equipment.

2034
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:23,494
And we're really excited to

2035
01:08:23,498 --> 01:08:24,428
bring more enhancements to

2036
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:27,002
workouts in watchOS 5, starting

2037
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,232
with a new workout type for

2038
01:08:28,236 --> 01:08:29,066
yoga.

2039
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,310
Now this works primarily from

2040
01:08:30,305 --> 01:08:32,675
your heart rate, and we

2041
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:34,214
calibrate this to your fitness

2042
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:35,549
through the rest of your day, so

2043
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,474
now you can more accurately

2044
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:38,048
track those yoga sessions

2045
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:39,616
including those intense Vinyasa

2046
01:08:39,614 --> 01:08:40,614
sessions.

2047
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:42,655
New we've also added a new

2048
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:44,521
workout type for hiking.

2049
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:45,959
This takes into account pace and

2050
01:08:45,954 --> 01:08:47,754
heart rate and elevation gain so

2051
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:48,786
you can more accurately get

2052
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,030
exercise credit while you're

2053
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:51,725
hiking on steep terrain or

2054
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:53,326
really long stages.

2055
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:56,698
And Apple watch has become a

2056
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,538
really great running companion

2057
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,803
especially now that we've added

2058
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,671
GPS and cellular and music

2059
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,500
streaming.

2060
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:03,404
And we're making this an even

2061
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:04,805
better experience now for

2062
01:09:04,806 --> 01:09:06,646
training runs and races.

2063
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:07,581
In addition to current and

2064
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:08,976
average pace, you now have the

01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:04,243
Siri watch phase.

2253
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,409
Now currently to talk to Siri

2254
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:07,207
you raise your wrist and you

2255
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:08,378
say, hey Siri.

2256
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:09,716
And when you think about this,

2257
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:10,841
it's quite a strong signal when

2258
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,115
you raise your wrist and talk to

2259
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:12,943
your watch.

2260
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:13,777
It's kind of like when someone's

2261
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:14,921
standing right in front of you,

2262
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:15,746
you don't need to say hey

2263
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,650
because you have their attention

2264
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:18,451
already, so we're bringing this

2265
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:20,623
same social cue to Siri on the

2266
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,122
watch so you no longer need to

2267
01:14:23,124 --> 01:14:24,864
say, hey Siri.

2268
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:26,029
You just raise your wrist and

2269
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:27,627
talk to Siri.

2270
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:32,970
[applause] Now we're also

2271
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:33,797
bringing a number of

2272
01:14:33,801 --> 01:14:35,301
improvements to Notifications,

2273
01:14:35,303 --> 01:14:36,543
which are now more actionable

2274
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,868
and interactive.

2275
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:38,912
So, for example, with this

2276
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,507
notification from Quantis, you

2277
01:14:40,508 --> 01:14:41,548
can check in and share your

2278
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:42,843
flight details right from the

2279
01:14:42,844 --> 01:14:44,514
notification.

2280
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:45,552
After you finish a ride with

2281
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,247
Dee, you can scroll down.

2282
01:14:47,248 --> 01:14:48,648
You can rate your ride and pay

2283
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,250
with Apple Pay right there in

2284
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:51,851
the notification.

2285
01:14:51,853 --> 01:14:53,083
And with this one from Yelp that

2286
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,357
your table is ready, if you need

2287
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:55,625
a bit more time, you can extend

2288
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:56,923
the reservation out a bit just

2289
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,125
by tapping here.

2290
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,566
So super easy now to interact

2291
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,461
right in place inside

2293
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,964
We've also improved our Message

2294
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:05,165
notification.

2295
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,166
Today if someone sends you a

2296
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,807
weblink, you aren't able to view

2297
01:15:07,802 --> 01:15:08,942
it on your list.

2298
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,077
With watchOS 5, we've integrated

2299
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:12,202
WebKit, so now you have the

2300
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:14,076
ability to view web content and

2301
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:16,345
mail or messages.

2302
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,214
You can even tap on that link,

2303
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:20,552
yes, to easily view things like

2304
01:15:20,548 --> 01:15:21,378
menus here.

2305
01:15:21,382 --> 01:15:23,522
And while we think full browsing

2306
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:24,388
doesn't make sense on your

2307
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:25,755
wrist, there are times you get

2308
01:15:25,753 --> 01:15:26,593
content.

2309
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:27,418
You'd like to see it right in

2310
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,252
the moment, and now you'll be

2311
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:29,856
able to do that and watch OS 5.

2312
01:15:29,857 --> 01:15:30,727
And the contents can be

2313
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:32,125
formatted for the small screen,

2314
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,226
and the where reader made is

2315
01:15:33,227 --> 01:15:34,297
available, it uses that on the

2316
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:35,065
watch.

2317
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,503
So WebKit on watchOS.

[ Applause ]

2319
01:15:44,038 --> 01:15:45,078
Now with watchOS 4, we

2320
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,543
introduced an entirely new way

2321
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,641
to listen to music while you're

2322
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:48,472

2323
01:15:48,476 --> 01:15:50,076
You can stream 48 million songs

2325
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,649

And now with watchOS 5, we're

2328
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:57,915
giving you even more to listen

2329
01:15:57,919 --> 01:15:58,519
to.

That's right.

The Apple podcast app is coming

2333
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,260
to Apple Watch.

2334
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:08,461
Upcoming episodes from

2335
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:09,733
subscribed podcasts will be

2336
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:10,861
automatically synced to your

2337
01:16:10,865 --> 01:16:12,235
watch, so you can get them right

2338
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:14,603
there, or you can just ask Siri

2339
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:15,942
to stream a podcast for you, and

2340
01:16:15,937 --> 01:16:17,707
it'll start playing and playback

2341
01:16:17,705 --> 01:16:19,305
resume across all your devices

2342
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:20,577
so you can continue just where

2343
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:21,675
you left off.

2344
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,976
So that's Podcast.

2345
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:24,848
Now those are the great new

2346
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,346

course walkie talkie.

Now we'd like to show you this

stuff live in action, and we

2356
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:40,594
thought we'd increase the

2362
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:48,775

01:16:57,478 --> 01:16:58,548
coaching, and she knows how to

move and demonstrate and

01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,450
motivate all at the same time.

really going to love, and the

closing my rings while I do it.

2376
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,991
So, first, I'm super excited to

01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:13,633
show you how easy it is to start

2378
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:14,898
a workout with GymKit.

2379
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:18,666
I just tap to connect and accept

2380
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,236
on the watch, and now I can

2381
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:22,604
control and start the workout

2382
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:23,873
right here from the console on

All of my data between the watch

2385
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:28,374
and the bike is in sync, and all

2386
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:29,476
of my workout metrics are

2387
01:17:29,477 --> 01:17:30,877
accurate.

2388
01:17:30,878 --> 01:17:32,018
Now, I wouldn't typically be

you activity competitions.

that Jay has moved ahead of me

2407
01:17:58,873 --> 01:18:00,003
by a couple of points, and

2408
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:01,047
that's not okay because this

him a little smack talk to let

2418
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,323
him know I'm coming for him.

Now in watchOS 5, notifications

from apps are smartly grouped

2439
01:18:51,492 --> 01:18:52,732
together, and here are a couple

01:18:55,129 --> 01:18:56,099
We're trying to get to a yoga

01:18:56,097 --> 01:18:57,267
retreat this summer, and it

2444
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,035
looks like she sent me a link.

2445
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:01,933
Now, I can tap it here and see

2446
01:19:01,936 --> 01:19:03,676
if she's found somewhere great

Oh yeah, this looks beautiful.

Let me show you the enhancements

2459
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:26,593
that we've made to the new Siri

to it, I can just tap.

Next up is Glow Baby, because

2466
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:36,709
it's about this time each day

2467
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:38,144
that I check the app to see if

2468
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:39,139
my husband has logged our

Oh, good job, baby.

parents know that good naps

2473
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,443
equal good nights, so I'm

2474
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:48,287
looking forward to that.

Here's that dinner that Siri

2481
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,296
found in my calendar, and

2482
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:01,834
waiting for me at the end of my

2483
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:03,729

Now, I want to check back in on

2487
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,840
this competition, but I thought

2488
01:20:10,838 --> 01:20:12,108
it might be a good idea to get a

2489
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:13,476
little moral support from my

And you heard Kevin say how

2492
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,780
walkie talkie is so great for

staying in touch with close

friends and family.

2495
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:21,487
So I set my daughter up with

2496
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,282
walkie talkie so that she can

2497
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:24,454
help demo what it's like to

2498
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,192
receive one and maybe give me a

work right in the moment.

And apps can include interactive

01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:14,954
Since its introduction, the

2624
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:16,949
Apple TV business has grown an

2625
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:19,921
incredible 50 percent.

2626
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,620
Today, we've got some great new

2627
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:24,022
enhancements to Apple TV 4K and

2628
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:25,594
tvOS, and we think you're going

2629
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:26,693
to love them.

2630
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:29,694
So I'd like to invite Apple TV

2631
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,697
lead designer, Jen Fuls

2632
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:32,699
[phonetic] to the stage to tell

2633
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,600
you all about it.

2634
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:34,431
Jen. [applause]

2635
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:36,505
Thanks Tim.

2636
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:40,174
[ Applause ]

2637
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:41,404
Apple TV is built on an

2638
01:24:41,408 --> 01:24:43,878
incredible platform, tvOS.

2639
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,778
And tvOS is built specifically

2640
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,180
for the living room, to make it

2641
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:50,182
easy to enjoy your favorite TV

2642
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:53,554
shows, movies, apps, and games.

2643
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:54,924
Now as Tim mentioned, last

2644
01:24:54,922 --> 01:24:56,892
September, we introduced Apple

2645
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,531
TV 4K with the goal of bringing

2646
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,227
the highest quality cinematic

2647
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:04,298
experience right to your home.

2648
01:25:04,298 --> 01:25:06,968
It offers both 4K and high

2649
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:08,967
dynamic range, including support

2650
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:11,969
for HDR 10 and Dolby Vision.

2651
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:14,042
Time said, the new Apple TV is a

2652
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:16,581
high fidelity powerhouse.

2653
01:25:16,577 --> 01:25:18,447
And to ensure you can enjoy this

2654
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:20,015
beautiful experience with as

2655
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:23,584
much content as possible, iTunes

2656
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:26,124
offers the largest collection of

2657
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,490
4K HDR movies.

[ Applause ]

2659
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:33,766
And we've upgraded your

2660
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,231
previously purchased movies to

2661
01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:37,869
4K HDR for free on all available

2662
01:25:37,865 --> 01:25:39,565
titles.

2663
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:42,167
There are also, thank you, there

2664
01:25:42,169 --> 01:25:44,839
are also many 4K and HDR TV

2665
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:46,408
shows available from popular

2666
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,477
services like Amazon Prime video

2667
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,675
and Netflix.

2668
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,178
And we know what makes for an

2669
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:54,349
amazing cinematic experience is

2670
01:25:54,348 --> 01:25:56,748
not just great picture quality.

2671
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,750
It's also incredible sound.

2672
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:02,422
So Apple TV 4K is bringing you

2673
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:04,963
the latest in audio technology,

2674
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:08,999
Dolby Atmos.

2675
01:26:10,464 --> 01:26:15,574
[ Applause ]

2676
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:18,269
With Atmos, you get room-filling

2677
01:26:18,272 --> 01:26:19,102
sound.

2678
01:26:19,106 --> 01:26:20,646
The perfect complement to the

2679
01:26:20,641 --> 01:26:23,711
stunning visuals of Apple TV 4K.

2680
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,351
Now what makes Atmos so special

2681
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:27,817
is that unlike a traditional

2682
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:28,915
surround sound setup, where

2683
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:30,316
sound is assigned to channels

2684
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:32,857
like the left or the right,

2685
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:34,653
Dolby Atmos has the ability to

2686
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:37,225
completely immerse you.

2687
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:38,764
Atmos moves sound in

2688
01:26:38,759 --> 01:26:40,359
three-dimensional space,

2689
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,831
creating an experience with

2690
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,999
powerful audio that flows all

2691
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:44,998
around you.

2692
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,669
It puts you right in the center

2693
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:48,407
of the action.

2694
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:50,102
All this with a home theater

2695
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:52,374
setup as simple as a Dolby Atmos

2696
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,613
enabled soundbar and an Apple TV

2697
01:26:54,608 --> 01:26:55,778
4K.

2698
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:58,546
In fact, Apple TV 4K is the only

2699
01:26:58,545 --> 01:26:59,815
streaming player to be both

2700
01:26:59,813 --> 01:27:01,513
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos

2701
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:02,445

And just like with 4K HDR, your

2708
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:18,671
iTunes libraries will be

2709
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,736
upgraded to include Dolby Atmos

on all supported titles for

01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:27,607
free.

01:27:27,608 --> 01:27:28,438
[applause] Now of course these

2713
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:30,212
movies and so much more are

2714
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:33,250
available in the Apple TV app.

2715
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:35,347
The Apple TV app is the center

2716
01:27:35,349 --> 01:27:37,349
of your video experience, a

2717
01:27:37,351 --> 01:27:39,221
single place to find and watch

2718
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:40,489
what you love across your

2719
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:41,887
favorite apps.

2720
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,289
It's on Apple TV, iPad and

2721
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,931
iPhone where you can find not

2722
01:27:45,926 --> 01:27:47,496
only On Demand TV shows and

2723
01:27:47,494 --> 01:27:49,934
movies but also live content

2724
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,500
including sports.

2725
01:27:51,498 --> 01:27:53,168
The Apple TV app now offers a

2726
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:57,137
huge range of live sports.

2727
01:27:57,137 --> 01:27:59,137
And we've added live news to

2728
01:27:59,139 --> 01:28:00,809
make it even easier to stay

2729
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,348
current.

2730
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,313
The edition of live sports and

2731
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:05,381
news providers brings the

2732
01:28:05,379 --> 01:28:07,049
coverage of the TV app to over

2733
01:28:07,047 --> 01:28:10,617
100 video channels, giving you a

2734
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:12,657
massive selection of content all

2735
01:28:12,653 --> 01:28:14,293
in one place.

2736
01:28:14,288 --> 01:28:16,188
With all this, Apple TV is the

2737
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,560
best box to connect to your TV.

2738
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:20,299
And that's now more true than

2739
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:22,134
ever as more and more cable

2740
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,569
companies fundamentally shift

2741
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,405
how video gets to your TV.

2742
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,940
This typical cable box is

2743
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:31,035
becoming a thing of the past as

2744
01:28:31,038 --> 01:28:32,238
these companies embrace

2745
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,209
internet-based delivery.

2746
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,408
And many of them share our

2747
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,650
vision of Apple TV as the one

2748
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:41,115
device for live, On Demand, and

2749
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:43,615
Cloud DVR content.

2750
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:44,547
And we've already started

2751
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:46,051
working with partners around the

2752
01:28:46,053 --> 01:28:48,923
world to make this a reality.

2753
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:50,422
In France, we're working with

2754
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:52,224
Canal Plus.

2755
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,626
Almost a third of French

2756
01:28:53,627 --> 01:28:55,097
households subscribe to Canal

2757
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:57,135

in 4K.

2763
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:09,143
In Switzerland, we've partnered

2764
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:10,373
with Salt.

2765
01:29:10,377 --> 01:29:11,877
Salt just launched a new TV

2766

exclusively on Apple TV.

2769

[ Applause ]

2774
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:34,469
That means that up to 50 million

2775
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:35,838
homes will be able to choose

2776
01:29:35,836 --> 01:29:37,976
Apple TV to access all their

01:29:37,971 --> 01:29:39,941
live channels and thousands of

01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,510
On Demand programs.

2779
01:29:41,508 --> 01:29:43,278
And, they'll be able to use Siri

2780
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:45,517
and the TV app to get access to

2781
01:29:45,512 --> 01:29:47,282
their TV service not only on

as well.

2784
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,650
Now with nearly any cable

2785
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,394
subscription, you can get access

2786
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:57,889
to dozens of video channels like

2787
01:29:57,891 --> 01:30:00,591
ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many

2788
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:02,834
more, but it used to be really

2789
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,870

2790
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:06,365
authenticate each app

2791
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:07,366
individually.

I'm sure all of you have seen

Charter Spectrum [applause]--

2813
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:51,611
this is really awesome-- and

2814
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,942
Charter Spectrum will be the

2815
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:54,546
first to support zero sign-on

2816
01:30:54,548 --> 01:30:55,478
and we'll be adding more

2817
01:30:55,482 --> 01:30:57,722
providers over time.

2818
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:59,118
We're also giving you even more

2819
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:00,659
options for ways to control your

2820
01:31:00,654 --> 01:31:02,194
Apple TV.

2821
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:03,829
For example, you can get quick

2822
01:31:03,824 --> 01:31:05,524
access on your iPhone where

2823
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,026
Apple TV users will get the

2824
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:09,097
Apple TV remote automatically

2825
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:10,796
added to control center.

2826
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:12,867
And, for those that have

2827
01:31:12,866 --> 01:31:14,636
installed home control systems,

2828
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,805
we're working with the leading

2829
01:31:15,802 --> 01:31:17,272
providers so that you can use

2830
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:18,801
their remotes to control your

2831
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:21,045
Apple TV, even including support

2832
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:22,281
for Siri.

2833
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:26,416
At Apple, I love working with an

2834
01:31:26,413 --> 01:31:28,453
amazing team designing for a

2835
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,348
product that I enjoy every day

2836
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:32,290
and on the biggest screen in my

2837
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:33,216
home.

2838
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,590
I get to watch all my favorite

2839
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:39,830
movies, TV shows and more.

2840
01:31:39,826 --> 01:31:42,366
Over 40 million songs including

2841
01:31:42,362 --> 01:31:45,862
the best metal on Apple Music.

2842
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:47,966
All of my photos, videos, and

2843
01:31:47,968 --> 01:31:50,868
memories as well as thousands of

2844
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:52,971
apps and games that many of you

2845
01:31:52,973 --> 01:31:54,273
have built.

2846
01:31:54,274 --> 01:31:57,314
And, Apple TV brings some

2847
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,881
amazing views right to my living

2848
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,320
room with Aerials.

2849
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:03,646
Now, one of the questions I get

2850
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:05,320
asked the most about Aerials,

2851
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:06,789
especially by my family members

2852
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:08,757
is where is this?

2853
01:32:08,755 --> 01:32:11,095
Well, this ball with just a tap

2854
01:32:11,091 --> 01:32:13,091
of the Siri remote, you'll now

2855
01:32:13,093 --> 01:32:15,193
be able to see every Arial

2856
01:32:15,195 --> 01:32:16,495

2858
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,172
And, you can even swipe between

2859
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:25,470
locations so you can see even

2860
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,302
more.

2861
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:29,476
And today, I have an incredible

2862
01:32:29,476 --> 01:32:31,146
new location to share with you.

2863
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:34,414
For the past year, we've been

2864
01:32:34,414 --> 01:32:36,084
collaborating closely with an

2865
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:38,183
amazing partner, filming some

2866
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:39,685
stunning footage from around the

2867
01:32:39,686 --> 01:32:42,326
world with a very unique vantage

2868
01:32:42,322 --> 01:32:46,932
point, and here it is.

2869
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:48,057
Earth.

2870
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:55,739
[ Applause ]

2871
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:57,436
This is filmed by astronauts

2872
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,177
aboard the International Space

2873
01:32:59,172 --> 01:33:00,112
Station.

2874
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,677
You can see Sicily just off the

2875
01:33:01,675 --> 01:33:03,345
boot of Italy, and check out

2876
01:33:03,343 --> 01:33:04,583
that Mediterranean Sea.

2877
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,478
The blue is just phenomenal.

2878
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,320
So here's a fun fact.

2879
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:10,916
The Space Station makes an orbit

2880
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:13,057
every 90 minutes, so that means

2881
01:33:13,053 --> 01:33:15,893
they get 16 sunrises and sunsets

2882
01:33:15,889 --> 01:33:16,689
every day.

2883
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,660
And with all those sunsets,

2884
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,259
nighttime can be particularly

2885
01:33:21,261 --> 01:33:22,531
stunning the way those urban

2886
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,429
areas pop with light.

2887
01:33:24,431 --> 01:33:25,731
Here we are flying over South

2888
01:33:25,732 --> 01:33:27,572
Korea toward Japan.

2889
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:29,037
You can see Tokyo coming into

2890
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:31,036
view at the top, some distant

2891
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:33,278
stars, and even upper reaches of

2892
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:34,613
the Earth's atmosphere, which is

2893
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:37,078
that orange band enveloping the

2894
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:38,207
Earth.

2895
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:42,688
And here's one that might look a

2896
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:43,953
little more familiar.

2897
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,650
This is the Northern California

2898
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:47,892
coast heading southward.

2899
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:49,058
You can see Lake Tahoe

2900
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,656
surrounded by snowcaps and the

2901
01:33:51,658 --> 01:33:54,098
San Francisco Bay.

2902
01:33:54,094 --> 01:33:56,964
These are truly incredible and

2903
01:33:56,963 --> 01:33:58,703
offer such a unique perspective

2904
01:33:58,699 --> 01:33:59,699
on the world.

2905
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,670
I'd like to give a huge thanks

Station National Lab and CASIS

2908
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:06,572
for all their help in making

2909
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,473
this a possibility.

[ Applause ]

2911
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:15,714
These are going to look

2912
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:20,556
incredible at home in 4K HDR.

2913
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,654
So that's tvOS.

2914
01:34:21,655 --> 01:34:24,795
Apple TV gives you amazing

2915
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:27,531
picture and sound with 4K HDR

2916
01:34:27,527 --> 01:34:29,827
and now Dolby Atmos.

01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,500
And the Apple TV app is the

2918
01:34:31,498 --> 01:34:33,838
center of your video experience.

2919
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,304
Available on Apple TV, iPad, and

01:34:43,343 --> 01:34:43,843
to Tim.

We love the Mac.

2934
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,640
The Mac was the first computer

2935
01:35:08,635 --> 01:35:11,605
that made powerful technology so

2936
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:14,005
easy to use and put the customer

2937
01:35:14,007 --> 01:35:16,047
at the center of the experience.

2938
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:17,712
And of course that remains at

2939
01:35:17,711 --> 01:35:19,351
the core of all Apple products.

2940
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:23,546
For more than 30 years, the Mac

2941
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,520
has empowered people to create

2942
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:28,889
all kinds of amazing things,

2943
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:31,129
from the personal to the

professional.

2945
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,696
Today, we're excited to take Mac

2946
01:35:34,694 --> 01:35:37,194
a huge leap forward.

2947
01:35:37,197 --> 01:35:39,137
The next version of macOS is

2948
01:35:39,132 --> 01:35:40,902
chock full of new features

2955
01:35:55,048 --> 01:35:57,818
Hello again.

2956
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,588
It's true that macOS is the

2957
01:35:59,586 --> 01:36:03,456
heart of what makes a Mac a Mac.

2958
01:36:03,456 --> 01:36:05,626
And we want as many Mac users as

2959
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:07,125
possible to have access to our

2960
01:36:07,127 --> 01:36:09,227
latest software, and that's why

2961
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:10,829
six years ago with the

2962
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,431
introduction of OS 10 Mavericks,

2963
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,033
we began offering our macOS

2964
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:17,505
updates free for Mac users.

2965
01:36:17,504 --> 01:36:19,604
And 2013 was also the year that

2966
01:36:19,606 --> 01:36:21,206
we first introduced our

2967
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:24,008
California naming theme.

2968
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,950
Now after spending a year by the

2969
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,046
ocean, we not only modernized

2970
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:30,388
the look and feel of macOS, but

2971
01:36:30,383 --> 01:36:32,183
we headed to the mountains with

2972
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:35,225
macOS Yosemite.

2973
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:38,062
Now, as you may be aware, our

2974
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:39,628
naming of Mac releases is

2975
01:36:39,626 --> 01:36:41,596
handled by our crack marketing

2976
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:44,735
organization, and as you've

2977
01:36:44,731 --> 01:36:46,731
probably noticed, they went on a

2978
01:36:46,733 --> 01:36:50,933
four-year mountain-bound bender.

2979
01:36:50,937 --> 01:36:52,177
[laughter] In El Capitan we

2980
01:36:52,172 --> 01:36:54,342
added metal, our ground-breaking

2981
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,141
graphics technology.

2982
01:36:56,142 --> 01:36:57,682
In Sierra, we brought Siri to

2983
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:58,947
the Mac and extended our

2984
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:01,185
capabilities and continuity.

2985
01:37:01,181 --> 01:37:03,581
And last year with High Sierra,

2986
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:05,623
we focused on deep technology,

2987
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,259
preparing the Mac for future

2988
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:08,524
innovation.

2989
01:37:08,521 --> 01:37:10,091
Well this year, we made some

2990
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:13,190
striking changes to macOS, and

2991
01:37:13,193 --> 01:37:15,393
we've left the high country for

2992
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:17,265
a place entirely different but

2993
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:20,004
not less beautiful and here

2994
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
still in California, and I'd

01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:24,102
like to take you there now.

2996
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:30,144
Our next release of macOS is

2997
01:37:30,143 --> 01:37:33,483
macOS Mojave.

2998
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:40,020
[ Applause ]

2999
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,920
Now, Mojave is beautiful during

3000
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:43,322
the day, but what really

3001
01:37:43,323 --> 01:37:45,463
captured our imagination was the

3002
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:48,928
beauty of the desert at night.

3003
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:52,529
And this inspired one of our

3004
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:55,802
most distinctive new features,

3005
01:37:55,802 --> 01:38:00,572
and I'd like to show it to you

3006
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:01,713
now.

3007
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:06,109
So here we are live in macOS

3008
01:38:06,112 --> 01:38:09,212
Mojave, and I'd like to show you

3009
01:38:09,215 --> 01:38:11,985
a new side of Mojave.

3010
01:38:11,985 --> 01:38:15,455
We call it dark mode.

3011
01:38:15,455 --> 01:38:23,225
[ Applause ]

3012
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:25,429
And as you see, dark mode is not

3013
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:27,032
just about the dock or the menu

3014
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:27,803
bar.

3015
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:28,631
It extends to your Windows

3016
01:38:28,635 --> 01:38:30,105
Chrome, your sidebar, and even

3017
01:38:30,103 --> 01:38:32,143
the content of the Windows, and

3018
01:38:32,138 --> 01:38:33,478
it's so great for Pros.

3019
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:35,673
It makes photographic content

3020
01:38:35,675 --> 01:38:38,615
absolutely pop off the screen.

3021
01:38:38,611 --> 01:38:40,851
It's just gorgeous.

3022
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:44,087
It's so nice.

3023
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,354
And this is great not just for

3024
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,693
photography but when working on

3025
01:38:48,688 --> 01:38:51,558
presentations or documents.

3026
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:53,128
It's also great doing ordinary

3027
01:38:53,126 --> 01:38:53,956
things.

3028
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,690
Maybe you're working in a dark

3029
01:38:54,694 --> 01:38:55,764
environment.

3030
01:38:55,762 --> 01:38:58,132
Just look at calendar.

3031
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:00,771
Even mail in dark mode.

3032
01:39:00,767 --> 01:39:02,537
It's so great.

3033
01:39:02,535 --> 01:39:04,135
And I think some of us are going

3034
01:39:04,137 --> 01:39:05,377
to want to run dark mode just

3035
01:39:05,372 --> 01:39:07,242
because it's so cool.

3036
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,740
I mean your emoji look great.

3037
01:39:09,743 --> 01:39:11,443
Your photos look great.

3038
01:39:11,444 --> 01:39:13,884
I mean check out your album art

in Apple Music.

01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:19,891
But I think one audience that's

3042
01:39:19,886 --> 01:39:21,286
going to especially appreciate

in this room, our developers,

3045
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:27,061
because Expo looks fantastic in

3046
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,460
dark mode.

even interface builder and all

01:39:37,337 --> 01:39:39,407
of its inspectors, they just

3051

look fantastic in black.

And that's a quick look at dark

3053

mode.

3054
01:39:46,212 --> 01:39:49,612
Now, we were so inspired by this

3055
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:52,186
changing desktop wallpaper that

3056
01:39:52,185 --> 01:39:53,555
we decided to add a new feature

3057
01:39:53,553 --> 01:39:54,923
to Mojave that I think you'll

3058
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:56,361
enjoy.

3059
01:39:56,356 --> 01:39:58,656
It's called dynamic desktop, and

3060
01:39:58,658 --> 01:39:59,558
when you're using it, you're

3061
01:39:59,559 --> 01:40:01,899
desktop actually subtly changes

3062
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:04,695
throughout the day from morning,

3063
01:40:04,697 --> 01:40:08,397
to afternoon, to evening.

3064
01:40:08,401 --> 01:40:10,071
It's really cool.

3065
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:12,270
Now, there's much more to Mojave

3066
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:15,142
that I'd like to share with you

3067
01:40:15,141 --> 01:40:17,611
through demos, and it starts

3068
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,710
with the desktop.

3069
01:40:19,712 --> 01:40:23,412
Now, the desktop is so crucial

3070
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:25,186
to how many of us use our Macs.

3071
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,085
When we have files that we're

3072
01:40:26,086 --> 01:40:27,786
actively working on, we often

3073
01:40:27,787 --> 01:40:29,457
put them on the desktop, but the

3074
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:31,496
result can be a desktop that

3075
01:40:31,491 --> 01:40:34,761
looks something like this.

3076
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:36,301
And so now in Mojave we have a

3077
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:38,396
really great solution, and we

3078
01:40:38,398 --> 01:40:42,198
call it Desktop Stacks.

3079

All of the contents of your

3081
01:40:48,808 --> 01:40:51,448
desktop are automatically

3082
01:40:51,444 --> 01:40:53,684
arranged into these stacks, and

3083
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,680
they can be arranged by kind, by

3084
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:58,983
date, or even by tag, and

3085
01:40:58,985 --> 01:41:00,325
they're really easy to use.

3086
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,590
You just click on them.

3087
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,888
You can see all the contents in

3088
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:03,719
the stack.

3089
01:41:03,723 --> 01:41:05,063
You can double click to open a

3090
01:41:05,058 --> 01:41:07,128
document and put it away.

3091
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:09,267
And they stay organized.

3092
01:41:09,262 --> 01:41:10,762
So for instance, if I bring

3093
01:41:10,763 --> 01:41:12,733
forward mail, maybe I drag an

3094
01:41:12,732 --> 01:41:14,072
image out, I want you to watch

3095
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:15,637
what happens because the image

3096
01:41:15,635 --> 01:41:17,775
flies right into the right

3097
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:18,840
stack.

3098
01:41:18,838 --> 01:41:20,808
Now you can also scrub your

3099
01:41:20,807 --> 01:41:21,807
stacks.

3100
01:41:21,808 --> 01:41:22,978
So, for instance, I'll just

3101
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:25,846
scrub across this stack.

3102
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:27,715
You see I can select between

3103
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:30,784
different photos, pick one up.

3104
01:41:30,783 --> 01:41:32,023
Actually let me just hide mail

3105
01:41:32,018 --> 01:41:33,558
here mid drag.

3106
01:41:33,553 --> 01:41:36,523
I got a little excited with my,

3107
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:39,723
with all of my stack action.

3108
01:41:39,726 --> 01:41:43,826
So I can just drag this out and

3109
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:45,800
drop it in just like that.

3110
01:41:45,798 --> 01:41:47,698

3111
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:48,570

01:41:48,568 --> 01:41:49,538

new changes to the finder.

I'd like to show them to you

now.

3118
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:04,220
Now it starts with a new view.

3119
01:42:04,217 --> 01:42:08,387
We all enjoy using icon view,

3120
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:09,358
list view.

3121
01:42:09,355 --> 01:42:11,355
There's of course column view,

3122
01:42:11,357 --> 01:42:13,697
but now we've added an all-new

3123
01:42:13,693 --> 01:42:15,663
view called gallery view.

3124
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:18,532
It has a big preview up top, a

3125
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:19,831
set of thumbnails along the

3126
01:42:19,832 --> 01:42:21,632
bottom, and it makes it easy to

3127
01:42:21,634 --> 01:42:24,934
preview images, video,

3128
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:28,038
presentations, documents,

3129
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:31,311
spreadsheets, PDFs, and of

3130
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:33,581
course with images sometimes you

3131
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,080
want to know more detail about,

3132
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:35,951
for instance, how they were

3133
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:37,349
captured, and now the new

3134
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:40,150
sidebar in Mojave really helps

3135
01:42:40,153 --> 01:42:42,753
because it now supports full

3136
01:42:42,755 --> 01:42:45,055
metadata, so you can see around

3137
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:47,398
your photo, the camera you took

3138
01:42:47,393 --> 01:42:50,033
the photo on, the kind of lens,

3139
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:51,869
the aperture settings, and so

3140
01:42:51,864 --> 01:42:52,494
forth.

3141
01:42:52,498 --> 01:42:53,498
It's really handy.

3142
01:42:53,499 --> 01:42:55,969
And you'll notice also along the

3143
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:57,239
bottom there's this new area

3144
01:42:57,237 --> 01:42:59,607
called Quick Actions, and Quick

current photo.

3147
01:43:02,308 --> 01:43:03,548
So, for instance, if I have a

3148
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:05,283
photo like this and I want to

3149
01:43:05,278 --> 01:43:06,978
edit it, I don't have to open it

3150
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,450
and go through a new app.

3151
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:10,448
I can rotate it right here

3152
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,690
inside the finder.

3153
01:43:12,685 --> 01:43:14,225
It's really powerful.

3154
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,760
Now this sidebar is available in

3155
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:17,325
other views of the finder.

3156
01:43:17,323 --> 01:43:18,463
So for instance, I'm just going

3157
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:19,728
to bring up the preview pane

3158
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:21,096
here, and I'm going to do a

3159
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:25,134
multi selection of a PDF as well

3160
01:43:25,131 --> 01:43:27,101
as several images, and you'll

3161
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,330
notice that the quick actions

3162
01:43:28,334 --> 01:43:30,534
area is contextual, so it shows

3163
01:43:30,536 --> 01:43:33,106
me create PDF as an option.

3164
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:34,406
I'm going to click create PDF,

3165
01:43:34,407 --> 01:43:36,177
and it's going to assemble all

3166
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:38,245
of these photos into a PDF just

3167
01:43:38,244 --> 01:43:39,414
like that.

3168
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:41,312
But what's really great is these

3169
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:43,954
actions are also customizable,

3170
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:45,390
so you can create automator

3171
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:47,455
actions and assign them to

3172
01:43:47,453 --> 01:43:50,553
buttons here inside of Finder.

3173
01:43:50,556 --> 01:43:51,626
So you'll notice that now that I

3174
01:43:51,624 --> 01:43:53,594
have this PDF selected, I have

3175
01:43:53,593 --> 01:43:55,433
an option to run a custom

3176
01:43:55,428 --> 01:43:56,598
automator action that I've

3177
01:43:56,596 --> 01:43:59,536
created called Watermark PDF.

3178
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:01,202
When I click it, my custom

3179
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:04,240

3180
01:44:04,237 --> 01:44:06,907
watermarked, just like that.

3181
01:44:06,906 --> 01:44:08,406
And those are some quick

3182
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:12,478
enhancements to the finder.

[ Applause ]

3184
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:18,219
Now a tool that I think many of

3185
01:44:18,217 --> 01:44:20,217
us love when working with files

3186
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:21,589
is Quick Look, and now in

3187
01:44:21,587 --> 01:44:23,657
Mojave, we made Quick Look more

3188
01:44:23,656 --> 01:44:25,626
powerful than ever by

3189
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,165
integrating Markup.

3190
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,200
Let me show you how it works.

3191
01:44:29,195 --> 01:44:32,265
So you see down here I have a

3192
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:34,165
permission slip and it's a PDF

3193
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:34,937
document.

3194
01:44:34,934 --> 01:44:36,034
I'm just going to hit tap

3195
01:44:36,035 --> 01:44:38,305
spacebar to Quick Look it, and

3196
01:44:38,304 --> 01:44:40,344
you notice now I have the option

3197
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,780
to invoke Markup.

3198
01:44:42,775 --> 01:44:45,445
I click, and now I have access

3199
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,985
to my markup tools, including my

3200
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,820
ability to sign this document.

3201
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:52,056
I can just drag out my signature

3202
01:44:52,051 --> 01:44:55,551
like this, and I'm done.

3203
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:57,955
Now this works for all kinds of

3204
01:44:57,957 --> 01:44:58,787
files.

3205
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,791
So, for instance, with images I

3206
01:45:00,793 --> 01:45:04,093
can rotate and crop, and with

3207
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:08,097
video I can even trim right here

3208
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:09,501
inside of Quick Look.

3209
01:45:09,502 --> 01:45:11,842
And that's a quick look at Quick

3210
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:12,468
Look.

3211

[ Applause ]

3212
01:45:17,343 --> 01:45:18,383
Next, I want to talk about how

3213
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:20,048
we capture content on our Mac

3214
01:45:20,046 --> 01:45:21,216
because one of the tools I think

3215
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:22,954
many of us use all the time is

3216
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:24,719
Screenshots, and we've made

3217
01:45:24,717 --> 01:45:26,657
Screenshots more powerful than

3218
01:45:26,652 --> 01:45:29,092
ever in Mohave.

3219
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:32,688
So let's take a look here at a

3220
01:45:32,692 --> 01:45:34,632
webpage, and I'm just going to

3221
01:45:34,627 --> 01:45:35,697
take a screenshot in the

3222
01:45:35,695 --> 01:45:36,465
traditional way.

3223
01:45:36,462 --> 01:45:37,432
I'm going to screen shot a

3224
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:40,200
selection of the page, and I

3225
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:41,239
want you to watch what happens

3226
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:42,064
in the lower right.

3227
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:44,868
I get a thumbnail instantly of

3228
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:46,571
that screenshot, and when I

3229
01:45:46,572 --> 01:45:47,642
double click in, I get an

3230
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,980
accelerated workflow right into

3231
01:45:49,976 --> 01:45:51,446
Markup where I have access to

3232
01:45:51,444 --> 01:45:53,084
all of my tools.

3233
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:54,419
So, for instance, if I want to

3234
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:57,054
create a magnification here, I

3235
01:45:57,049 --> 01:46:01,459
can just drag that out.

3236
01:46:01,454 --> 01:46:04,724
Magnify. It's that easy.

3237
01:46:04,724 --> 01:46:06,164
But now we've also made it

3238
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,999
easier to access a variety of

3239
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:09,934
tools, so when I bring up my

3240
01:46:09,929 --> 01:46:12,069
screenshotting, you see I'm

3241
01:46:12,064 --> 01:46:13,904
presented with this hud that

3242
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,130
tells me I can capture the

3243
01:46:15,134 --> 01:46:17,874
entire screen, a selected window

3244
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:19,840
or selection, but we've also

3245
01:46:19,839 --> 01:46:22,779
added screen capture for video

3246
01:46:22,775 --> 01:46:24,815
right into screenshotting.

3247
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:26,211
Let me show you how that works.

3248
01:46:26,212 --> 01:46:27,912
So I'm going to go to a webpage

3249
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:29,414
here that has an animation

3250
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:30,115
running.

3251
01:46:30,116 --> 01:46:31,456
I'm going to bring up my

3252
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,651
screenshotting tools, and say

3253
01:46:33,653 --> 01:46:36,453
record the selected area.

3254
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:37,926
I'll just make a nice selection

3255
01:46:37,924 --> 01:46:39,154
here.

3256
01:46:39,158 --> 01:46:40,758
Okay. And I'm recording just

3257
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,830
like that.

3258
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:42,998
Of course I can manipulate the

3259
01:46:42,995 --> 01:46:45,365
app, so all will be reflected in

3260
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:48,404
my recording, and when I'm done,

3261
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:49,531
I can click the stop button

3262
01:46:49,535 --> 01:46:50,835
right up here.

3263
01:46:50,837 --> 01:46:51,807
And now you notice I have this

3264
01:46:51,804 --> 01:46:53,004
thumbnail in the lower right.

3265
01:46:53,005 --> 01:46:55,845
Well I can actually pick this up

3266
01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:57,842
and drag it into a new space and

3267
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,844
incorporate it right into a

3268
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:02,616
document, just like that.

3269
01:47:02,615 --> 01:47:04,185
Now, we've further enhanced the

3270
01:47:04,183 --> 01:47:06,383
way you capture content, and

3271
01:47:06,385 --> 01:47:09,055
that brings me to Continuity.

3272
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:11,025
So Mac users love Continuity for

3273
01:47:11,023 --> 01:47:12,393
the way it lets us work across

3274
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:15,261
our devices with things like Air

3275
01:47:15,261 --> 01:47:16,861
Drop or the ability to unlock

3276
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:19,663
your Mac using your Apple Watch.

3277
01:47:19,665 --> 01:47:20,835
When it comes to capturing

3278
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:22,803
content, we'll walk around with

3279
01:47:22,802 --> 01:47:24,172
one of the best content capture

pockets, our phones.

3282
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:29,077
And so we wanted to take

3283
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:30,775
advantage of continuity to bring

3284
01:47:30,776 --> 01:47:32,076
that to the Mac with a feature

3285
01:47:32,078 --> 01:47:34,178
we call Continuity Camera.

3286
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:37,720
Let me show you how it works.

3287
01:47:37,717 --> 01:47:39,257
So here in my Keynote

3288
01:47:39,252 --> 01:47:41,392
presentation, I have a space

3289
01:47:41,387 --> 01:47:42,957
that's just waiting for a new

3290
01:47:42,955 --> 01:47:44,825
photo, and on my phone right

3291
01:47:44,824 --> 01:47:46,294
here.

3292
01:47:46,292 --> 01:47:47,932
Well, when I select this object,

3293
01:47:47,927 --> 01:47:50,627
I can choose to take a photo.

3294
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:51,800
And I want you to watch what

3295
01:47:51,797 --> 01:47:53,067
happens when I select this to my

3296
01:47:53,065 --> 01:47:54,035
phone.

3297
01:47:54,033 --> 01:47:56,073
It automatically immediately

3298
01:47:56,068 --> 01:47:59,708
lights up ready to take a photo.

3299
01:47:59,705 --> 01:48:03,745
So I can take one like this, and

3300
01:48:03,743 --> 01:48:06,713
when I do, I can select use

3301
01:48:06,712 --> 01:48:08,682
photo, and it apps directly in

3302
01:48:08,681 --> 01:48:09,381
my document.

3303
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:10,452

3305
01:48:15,187 --> 01:48:16,227

scanning documents.

3307
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:19,430
So here I have a place where I

3308
01:48:19,425 --> 01:48:21,325
could use a scan.

3309
01:48:21,327 --> 01:48:23,967

3310
01:48:23,963 --> 01:48:25,903
from the menu and this time scan

3311
01:48:25,898 --> 01:48:26,728

01:48:26,732 --> 01:48:28,632
Again, my camera lights up, this

3315
01:48:31,003 --> 01:48:32,203
I just scan like this.

3316
01:48:32,204 --> 01:48:35,574
I can save it.

3317
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:37,545
And my scan goes immediately,

3318
01:48:37,543 --> 01:48:39,913

3385
01:51:00,152 --> 01:51:01,822
Next, I'd like to talk about

3386
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,821
security and privacy.

3387
01:51:03,823 --> 01:51:05,963
You know, one of the reasons

3388
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:07,298
that people choose Apple

3389
01:51:07,293 --> 01:51:08,763
products is because of our

3390
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:10,601
commitment to security and

3391
01:51:10,596 --> 01:51:11,966
privacy.

3392
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:14,304
And we believe that your private

3393
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,740
data should remain private, not

3394
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,136
because you've done something

3395
01:51:18,137 --> 01:51:19,337
wrong or that you have something

3396
01:51:19,338 --> 01:51:21,078
to hide but because there can be

3397
01:51:21,073 --> 01:51:22,943
a lot of sensitive data on your

3398
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:24,912
devices, and we think you should

3399
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,550
be in control of who sees it.

3400
01:51:27,546 --> 01:51:29,546
Now, to begin we protect your

3401
01:51:29,548 --> 01:51:32,088
information on your devices

3402
01:51:32,084 --> 01:51:34,324
using state of the art hardware

3403
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,490
and software, and this year

3404
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,559
we're adding greater protections

3405
01:51:38,557 --> 01:51:40,327
about how apps can access that

3406
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:42,026
information.

3407
01:51:42,027 --> 01:51:44,167
Today, Apple devices check in

3408
01:51:44,163 --> 01:51:45,763
with you before granting an app

3409
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:47,735
access to information like your

3410
01:51:47,733 --> 01:51:49,003
location.

3411
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:50,171
You could tell because you'll

3412
01:51:50,169 --> 01:51:52,069
see an alert just like this one,

3413
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:54,141
and macOS already provides

3414
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,610
API-level protections for things

3415
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:59,249
like contacts, photos, calendar,

3416
01:51:59,245 --> 01:52:00,785
and reminders, but now in

3417
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:02,850
Mojave, we're extending these

3418
01:52:02,848 --> 01:52:04,988
protections to include your

3419
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:07,824
camera and your microphone as

3420
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:09,160
well as protecting sensitive

3421
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:10,755
parts of your file system, like

3422
01:52:10,756 --> 01:52:12,526

default for any app that you run

3426
01:52:19,231 --> 01:52:20,331
on the system, an important

3427
01:52:20,332 --> 01:52:22,502

Next, I want to turn to some

3430
01:52:28,107 --> 01:52:30,407
great enhancements to Safari.

3431
01:52:30,409 --> 01:52:32,279
Safari works really hard to

3432
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:33,848
protect your privacy, and this

3433
01:52:33,846 --> 01:52:36,116
year it's working even harder.

3434
01:52:36,115 --> 01:52:37,855
Last year, we introduced

3435
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,920
intelligent tracking prevention

3436
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:41,559
to dramatically reduce the

3437
01:52:41,554 --> 01:52:43,454
ability for apps to track you

3438
01:52:43,455 --> 01:52:46,625
across websites using cookies.

3439
01:52:46,625 --> 01:52:47,565
This is the kind of thing where

3440
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:48,960
you look at a product on one

3441
01:52:48,961 --> 01:52:49,791
site.

3442
01:52:49,795 --> 01:52:51,395
Then you move to another site

3443
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,097
and another site and somehow

3444
01:52:53,098 --> 01:52:54,168
this is just following you

3445
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:56,236
wherever you go.

3446
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:58,175

01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:07,785
used to track you, whether you

3452
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,480
click on them or not, and so

3453
01:53:10,482 --> 01:53:12,452

3454
01:53:12,451 --> 01:53:14,491

Now next let's talk about

3463
01:53:37,209 --> 01:53:38,479
Fingerprinting.

3464
01:53:38,477 --> 01:53:40,777
You know, data companies are

3465
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:43,119
clever and relentless, and in

3466
01:53:43,115 --> 01:53:45,955
addition to cookies, they use

3467
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:47,021
another method called

3468
01:53:47,019 --> 01:53:48,259
Fingerprinting.

And here's how it works.

3470
01:53:49,855 --> 01:53:51,355
Just like you can be identified

3471
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:53,527
by a fingerprint, it turns out

3472
01:53:53,525 --> 01:53:55,825
that when you browse the web,

3473
01:53:55,828 --> 01:53:57,498
you're device can be identify by

3474
01:53:57,496 --> 01:53:59,966
a unique set of characteristics,

3475
01:53:59,965 --> 01:54:02,365
like its configuration, its

3476
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,008
fonts that you have installed

3477
01:54:04,003 --> 01:54:05,643
and the plug-insulin that you

3478
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:06,638
might have on the device.

3479
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,609
And these data companies can use

3480
01:54:08,607 --> 01:54:10,107
the set of characteristics to

3481
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:12,309
construct a unique fingerprint

3482
01:54:12,311 --> 01:54:14,481
to track your device from site

3483
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,620
to site.

3484
01:54:16,615 --> 01:54:17,855
With Mojave, we're making it

3485
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,190
much harder for trackers to

3486
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:21,985
create a unique fingerprint.

3491

fonts, and Legacy plug-insulin

3492
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:31,396
are no longer supported, so

3493
01:54:31,397 --> 01:54:32,767
those can't contribute to a

3494
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:34,735

3495
01:54:34,733 --> 01:54:36,633

01:56:28,414 --> 01:56:30,514
a place organized around those

3553
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:31,546
themes.

3554
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:33,850
So we've redesigned an all new

3555
01:56:33,852 --> 01:56:35,692
Mac App Store from the ground

3556
01:56:35,687 --> 01:56:37,657
up, and we're thrilled to show

3557
01:56:37,656 --> 01:56:38,486
it to you now.

3558
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:46,130
[ Applause ]

3559
01:56:46,131 --> 01:56:47,301
It's got a beautiful UI that

3560
01:56:47,299 --> 01:56:49,539
should feel familiar but new and

3561
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:51,175
designed first and foremost to

3562
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:53,340
be a great Mac app.

3563
01:56:53,338 --> 01:56:54,508
Starting with the new discover

3564
01:56:54,506 --> 01:56:56,776
tab where each week you can find

3565
01:56:56,775 --> 01:56:58,915
in-depth editorial about the

3566
01:56:58,911 --> 01:57:01,011
best Mac apps through stories

3567
01:57:01,013 --> 01:57:03,353
and collections and see what's

3568
01:57:03,348 --> 01:57:06,648
most popular with top charts.

3569
01:57:06,652 --> 01:57:08,752
Here's a story about musician

3570
01:57:08,754 --> 01:57:11,024
and founder Karim Morsy.

3571
01:57:11,023 --> 01:57:13,563
Learn about how he uses his app,

3572
01:57:13,559 --> 01:57:15,929

3573
01:57:15,928 --> 01:57:18,098
for your own set.

Helpful videos auto play, so you

3575
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:22,239
can see what apps are capable of

3576
01:57:22,234 --> 01:57:25,004
before downloading them.

3577
01:57:25,003 --> 01:57:28,003
Visit the all-new create, work,

3578

3579
01:57:30,442 --> 01:57:31,482
you'll find helpful

3581
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:36,679
around each theme.

3582
01:57:36,682 --> 01:57:37,812
Here's the create tab where you

3583
01:57:37,816 --> 01:57:39,416
can find apps that bring your

3584
01:57:39,418 --> 01:57:41,788
artistic ideas to light.

3585
01:57:41,787 --> 01:57:43,457
These tabs will also help you

3586
01:57:43,455 --> 01:57:44,895
make the most of apps you might

3587
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,630
already have with tips and

3588
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:48,565
tutorials even the most expert

3589
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:51,060
users will find useful.

3590
01:57:51,063 --> 01:57:55,533
The work, play, and develop tabs

3591
01:57:55,534 --> 01:57:57,734
share the same beautiful design,

3592
01:57:57,736 --> 01:57:59,036
and you can still browse by

3593
01:57:59,037 --> 01:58:03,037
category on the categories tab.

3594
01:58:03,041 --> 01:58:04,681
We've redesigned product pages

3595
01:58:04,676 --> 01:58:06,746
too, bringing many features over

3596
01:58:06,745 --> 01:58:08,685
from iOS based on our learnings

3597
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:09,520
there.

3598
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:11,415
It has more useful information

3599
01:58:11,416 --> 01:58:13,416
like video previews available on

3600
01:58:13,418 --> 01:58:14,918

3601
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,390
time, an apps rank if it's

3602

editor's choice.

3604
01:58:20,125 --> 01:58:23,025
Ratings and reviews are now

3605
01:58:23,028 --> 01:58:25,198
front and center, and these are

3606
01:58:25,197 --> 01:58:27,267
so important for app discovery.

3607
01:58:27,266 --> 01:58:29,136
So we're introducing a ratings

3608
01:58:29,134 --> 01:58:32,004
and review API for Mac apps.

3609
01:58:32,004 --> 01:58:33,874
Now, it'll be easier than ever

3610
01:58:33,872 --> 01:58:36,812
for people to leave feedback.

3611
01:58:36,808 --> 01:58:38,408
We're really excited about the

3612
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:40,180
all-new Mac App Store.

3613
01:58:40,179 --> 01:58:41,479
We've talked to some developers

3614
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:42,810
already, and they're really

3615
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:44,254
excited too.

3616
01:58:44,249 --> 01:58:46,349
Like Microsoft, who will bring

3617
01:58:46,351 --> 01:58:48,821
Office 365 to the Mac App Store

3618
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:50,490
later this year.

01:59:11,043 --> 01:59:12,373
We can't wait for you to check

3629
01:59:12,377 --> 01:59:14,147
out the new Mac App Store.

[ Applause ]

3632
01:59:23,455 --> 01:59:24,995
So we think the Mac App Store is

3633
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:26,560
going to inspire whole-new

3634
01:59:26,558 --> 01:59:28,528
generations of apps, and so we

3635
01:59:28,527 --> 01:59:29,897
want to talk about some of the

3636
01:59:29,895 --> 01:59:32,695
technologies that will be behind

3637
01:59:32,698 --> 01:59:34,768
some of that next generation.

3638
01:59:34,766 --> 01:59:36,766
We spoke earlier about ARKit.

3639
01:59:36,768 --> 01:59:39,668
I want to talk about two more.

3640
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:42,341
And let's start with Metal.

3641
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:43,981
Now Metal is the technology to

3642
01:59:43,976 --> 01:59:45,406
get the highest performance

3643
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:47,610
graphics and computation from

3644
01:59:47,613 --> 01:59:49,283
graphics processors.

3645
01:59:49,281 --> 01:59:50,951
Metal was designed for modern

3646
01:59:50,949 --> 01:59:51,779
GPUs.

3647
01:59:51,783 --> 01:59:54,223
It's incredibly efficient, and

3648
01:59:54,219 --> 01:59:55,319
that enables amazing

3649
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:57,060
console-level games like

3650
01:59:57,055 --> 01:59:59,525
Fortnight from Epic to run great

3651
01:59:59,524 --> 02:00:02,624
for the first time on mobile.

3652
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:04,268
But Metal also enables these

3653
02:00:04,263 --> 02:00:06,733
games to scale to take full

3654
02:00:06,732 --> 02:00:09,372
advantage of modern Macs.

3655
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:11,538
In fact, across iOS and the Mac,

3656
02:00:11,536 --> 02:00:13,436
there are over one billion

3657
02:00:13,438 --> 02:00:16,608
Metal-enabled devices, and we're

3658
02:00:16,608 --> 02:00:18,948
constantly making Metal better.

3659
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,814
To bring the highest GPU

3660
02:00:20,812 --> 02:00:22,912
performance in reach of all

3661
02:00:22,914 --> 02:00:24,084
Macs, we've recently added

3662
02:00:24,082 --> 02:00:28,692
support for external GPUs, and

3663
02:00:28,687 --> 02:00:30,427
this is powered by Metal, and

3664
02:00:30,422 --> 02:00:31,892
the results are truly mind

3665
02:00:31,890 --> 02:00:32,890
boggling.

3666
02:00:32,891 --> 02:00:35,131
For instance, running a filter

3667
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:36,827
in DaVinci Resolve, look at how

3668
02:00:36,828 --> 02:00:38,898
it scales on the incredibly fast

3669
02:00:38,897 --> 02:00:41,797
iMac Pro as you add up to four

3670
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:42,630
eGPUs.

3671
02:00:42,634 --> 02:00:45,074
Now, the results are even more

3672
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:46,370
staggering when you take a

3673
02:00:46,371 --> 02:00:48,511
13-inch MacBook Pro and add

3674
02:00:48,507 --> 02:00:51,847
eGPUs to it, achieving up to 8.5

3675
02:00:51,843 --> 02:00:53,243
times speedup.

3676
02:00:53,245 --> 02:00:55,415
It's pretty awesome.

3677
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:57,654
Now, eGPUs also enable Macs to

3678
02:00:57,649 --> 02:00:58,989
achieve all-new levels of

3679
02:00:58,984 --> 02:01:00,854
performance and realism in 3D

3680
02:01:00,852 --> 02:01:02,822
rendering and gaming.

3681
02:01:02,821 --> 02:01:04,261
Now this beautiful forest you

3682
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,096
see here, this isn't a video

02:01:07,326 --> 02:01:09,666
This is from Unity's new Book of

3685
02:01:09,661 --> 02:01:11,601
the Dead interactive demo, and

3686
02:01:11,596 --> 02:01:13,836
it's being rendered live right

3687
02:01:13,832 --> 02:01:16,932
now on a MacBook with an eGPU

3688
02:01:16,935 --> 02:01:18,635
powering this display.

3689
02:01:18,637 --> 02:01:19,767
I mean doesn't this look

3690
02:01:19,771 --> 02:01:20,501
amazing?

[ Applause ]

3692
02:01:25,711 --> 02:01:27,011
Now, of course because this is

3693
02:01:27,012 --> 02:01:29,012
rendered live, we can check

3694
02:01:29,014 --> 02:01:30,454
what's up ahead, so let's start

3695
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:32,219
walking.

3696
02:01:32,217 --> 02:01:33,957
Now Unity is using Metal's

3697
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:36,652
unified graphics and compute to

3698
02:01:36,655 --> 02:01:39,125
generate real-time lighting and

3699
02:01:39,124 --> 02:01:43,194
complex post-processing effects.

3700
02:01:43,195 --> 02:01:46,835
So cool. And that's all rendered

3701
02:01:46,832 --> 02:01:49,102
live on a MacBook running with

3702
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:50,101
an eGPU.

3703
02:01:50,102 --> 02:01:51,532
It's pretty great.

with Metal is in machine

3708
02:02:01,313 --> 02:02:02,213
learning.

3709
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:04,854
And today ML specialists usually

3710
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:07,320
use one of these third-party

3711
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:09,189
libraries to train their models

3712
02:02:09,187 --> 02:02:11,357
using servers, and now it turns

3713
02:02:11,356 --> 02:02:13,296
out we can accelerate tools like

3714
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:14,461
this with our new Metal

3715
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:16,029
performance shaders.

3716
02:02:16,027 --> 02:02:17,597
We're seeing speedups of up to

3717
02:02:17,596 --> 02:02:20,166
20 times and using the GPU with

3718
02:02:20,165 --> 02:02:21,605

3721
02:02:23,802 --> 02:02:25,442
up is great, we actually thing

3722
02:02:25,437 --> 02:02:26,907
there's a better way for most

3723

3738
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:56,773
Playgrounds to train your model.

3739
02:02:56,768 --> 02:02:58,868
Just drag one in, you're

3740
02:02:58,870 --> 02:03:00,270
training set, you can drag in

3741
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:01,972
your test set as well, and the

3742
02:03:01,973 --> 02:03:03,813
training is all GPU accelerated,

3743
02:03:03,809 --> 02:03:06,279
so it's incredibly fast.

3744
02:03:06,278 --> 02:03:07,918
Now, as an example, we worked

3745
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:09,113
with Memrise.

3746
02:03:09,114 --> 02:03:10,814
They're a developer who uses the

3747
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:13,016
camera to identify objects and

3748
02:03:13,018 --> 02:03:13,848
speak them in multiple

3749
02:03:13,852 --> 02:03:15,992
languages, and in the past, they

3750
02:03:15,987 --> 02:03:16,887
would train their model with

3751
02:03:16,888 --> 02:03:18,728
20,000 images, and it would take

3752
02:03:18,723 --> 02:03:21,823
them 24 hours to do so.

3753
02:03:21,827 --> 02:03:23,897
Well now with Create ML, they

3754
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:27,235
can train that same model in 48

3755
02:03:27,232 --> 02:03:29,502
minutes on a MacBook Pro.

[ Applause ]

3757
02:03:34,539 --> 02:03:37,179
And on iMac Pro, it's just 18

3758
02:03:37,175 --> 02:03:38,005
minutes.

3759
02:03:38,009 --> 02:03:39,449
And what's even more incredible

3760
02:03:39,444 --> 02:03:41,044
is that model in the past for

3761
02:03:41,046 --> 02:03:43,486
them was 90 megabytes, and now

3762
02:03:43,482 --> 02:03:45,552
it's just three megabytes.

3763
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:48,520
It's a huge difference.

[ Applause ]

3765
02:03:52,224 --> 02:03:53,964
Now we also are making models

3766
02:03:53,959 --> 02:03:55,899
run much faster on device using

3767
02:03:55,894 --> 02:03:56,964
Core ML 2.

3768
02:03:56,962 --> 02:03:58,532
Now Core ML is our technology

3769
02:03:58,530 --> 02:04:00,130
for high performance on-device

3770
02:04:00,131 --> 02:04:01,801
machine learning, and now it's

3771
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,470
better than ever.

3772
02:04:03,468 --> 02:04:05,068
It's 30 percent faster in

3773
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:06,640
on-device processing using a

3774
02:04:06,638 --> 02:04:07,768
technique called batch

3775
02:04:07,772 --> 02:04:09,812
predictions, and you can reduce

3776
02:04:09,808 --> 02:04:12,048
your model size by up to 75

3777
02:04:12,043 --> 02:04:14,643
percent using quantization.

3778
02:04:14,646 --> 02:04:17,986
And so that's Core ML and Create

3779
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:18,783
ML.

3780
02:04:18,783 --> 02:04:19,783
You no longer have to be an

3781
02:04:19,784 --> 02:04:22,524
expert in machine learning to

3782
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:25,221
build those techniques into your

3783
02:04:25,223 --> 02:04:26,023
app.

3784
02:04:26,024 --> 02:04:27,524
Now, these technologies are

3785
02:04:27,526 --> 02:04:29,056
redefining what's possible in

3786
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:31,960

3787
02:04:31,963 --> 02:04:34,033
just to macOS but also to iOS,

3788
02:04:34,032 --> 02:04:36,032
and the fact that the mac and

3789
02:04:36,034 --> 02:04:39,074
iOS share so much technology has

3790
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:41,710
led people almost every year to

3791
02:04:41,706 --> 02:04:44,346
keep asking us the question, are

3792
02:04:44,342 --> 02:04:47,742
you merging iOS and macOS?

3793
02:04:47,746 --> 02:04:49,716
So I'd like to take a moment to

3794
02:04:49,714 --> 02:04:52,184
briefly address this question.

3795
02:04:52,183 --> 02:04:55,523
No. Of course not.

3796

[ Applause ]

3797
02:05:00,792 --> 02:05:02,662
We love the Mac because it's,

3798
02:05:02,661 --> 02:05:04,261
and we love macOS because it's

3799
02:05:04,262 --> 02:05:07,962
explicitly created that a unique

3800
02:05:07,966 --> 02:05:10,136
characteristics of Mac hardware,

3801
02:05:10,135 --> 02:05:11,635
like the ergonomics of the

3802
02:05:11,636 --> 02:05:13,506
keyboard and the trackpad, the

3803
02:05:13,505 --> 02:05:15,445
flexibility in displays and

3804
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,380
storage and because of the power

3805
02:05:17,375 --> 02:05:18,075
it exposes.

3806
02:05:18,076 --> 02:05:19,006
It makes the Mac able to

3807
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:21,210
accomplish almost anything.

3808
02:05:21,212 --> 02:05:22,882
So we think that this question

3809
02:05:22,881 --> 02:05:24,151
is actually coming from

3810
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:26,019
something else.

3811
02:05:26,017 --> 02:05:28,087
You know, Mac users have access

3812
02:05:28,086 --> 02:05:30,986
to a rich set of great native

3813
02:05:30,989 --> 02:05:32,989
applications, apps that take

3814
02:05:32,991 --> 02:05:35,061
full advantage of the power of

3815
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,760
Mac technologies.

3816
02:05:36,761 --> 02:05:39,001
But Mac users also use apps

3817
02:05:38,997 --> 02:05:40,867
based on other technologies.

3818
02:05:40,865 --> 02:05:42,735
We routinely access web-based

3819
02:05:42,734 --> 02:05:44,604
experiences like Netflix that

3820
02:05:44,603 --> 02:05:46,643
build on WebKit, the

3821
02:05:46,638 --> 02:05:48,408
standards-based web technology

3822
02:05:48,406 --> 02:05:50,646
in Safari, and we also run

3823
02:05:50,642 --> 02:05:53,142
sometimes cross-platform games

3824
02:05:53,144 --> 02:05:55,784
built on technology like metal.

3825
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:58,820
And all of these platforms

3826
02:05:58,817 --> 02:06:00,087
enrich the Mac user's

3827
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:01,355
experience.

3828
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:02,953
But we think there's room for

3829
02:06:02,954 --> 02:06:05,094
one more, and so we'd like to

3830
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,590
give you a sneak peek of a

3831
02:06:06,591 --> 02:06:08,631
multiyear project we have going

3832
02:06:08,627 --> 02:06:09,357
on.

3833
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:10,791
Because we see a huge

3834
02:06:10,795 --> 02:06:12,335
opportunity for the Mac to tap

3835
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:14,070
into the world's most vital app

3836
02:06:14,065 --> 02:06:15,635
ecosystem.

3837
02:06:15,634 --> 02:06:16,704
It's called iOS.

3838
02:06:16,701 --> 02:06:18,271
I think you might be familiar

3839
02:06:18,269 --> 02:06:19,269
with it.

3840
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:21,070
Now, there are millions of iOS

3841
02:06:21,072 --> 02:06:22,612
apps out there, and we think

3842
02:06:22,607 --> 02:06:24,177
some of them would be absolutely

3843
02:06:24,175 --> 02:06:26,845
great on the Mac, and Mac users

3844
02:06:26,845 --> 02:06:28,385
would love to have them there.

3845
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:30,920
And from a technical standpoint,

3846
02:06:30,915 --> 02:06:32,415
it's actually a really good fit

3847
02:06:32,417 --> 02:06:34,457
because from day one iOS and

3848
02:06:34,452 --> 02:06:35,852
macOS have shared common

3849
02:06:35,854 --> 02:06:37,524
foundations.

3850
02:06:37,522 --> 02:06:39,592
But iOS devices and Mac devices

3851
02:06:39,591 --> 02:06:40,991
of course are different, and the

3852
02:06:40,992 --> 02:06:42,592
user interfaces are somewhat

3853
02:06:42,594 --> 02:06:44,034
different and so the frameworks

3854
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:45,329
underneath are as well.

3855
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:46,830
And that makes today porting an

3856
02:06:46,831 --> 02:06:49,001
app from one to the other some

3857
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,270
work.

3858
02:06:50,268 --> 02:06:51,838
We wanted to make this much

3859
02:06:51,836 --> 02:06:54,736
easier, and so we've taken some

3860
02:06:54,739 --> 02:06:57,509
key frameworks from iOS and

3861
02:06:57,509 --> 02:06:59,549
brought them to the Mac.

3862
02:06:59,544 --> 02:07:00,944
And we've adapted them to

3863
02:07:00,945 --> 02:07:02,745
specific Mac behaviors like use

3864
02:07:02,747 --> 02:07:05,017
of trackpad and mouse, window

3865
02:07:05,016 --> 02:07:07,186
resizing, integration of things

3866
02:07:07,185 --> 02:07:08,955
like copy and paste and drag and

3867
02:07:08,953 --> 02:07:10,593
drop into the system services on

3868
02:07:10,588 --> 02:07:11,888
the mac.

3869
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:14,630
Now, phase one of this effort is

3870
02:07:14,626 --> 02:07:16,726
to test it on ourselves.

3871
02:07:16,728 --> 02:07:18,398
So this year in macOS, we've

3872
02:07:18,396 --> 02:07:22,066
taken some of our own iOS apps,

3873
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:23,637
and we brought them to the Mac

3874
02:07:23,635 --> 02:07:25,105
using those technologies to make

3875
02:07:25,103 --> 02:07:26,643
sure it works well.

3876
02:07:26,638 --> 02:07:27,608
You've actually heard about

3877
02:07:27,605 --> 02:07:29,445
several of them earlier today,

3878
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:33,211
and it turns out they make

3879
02:07:33,211 --> 02:07:35,411
fantastic Mac apps, and we're

3880
02:07:35,413 --> 02:07:37,553
able to bring them to the Mac

3881
02:07:37,549 --> 02:07:40,089
with very few code changes.

3882
02:07:40,085 --> 02:07:41,585
Now, this is going to be coming

3883
02:07:41,586 --> 02:07:44,486
to you developers next year.

3884
02:07:44,489 --> 02:07:46,359
So you can easily bring your iOS

3885
02:07:46,357 --> 02:07:48,227

3899

want them there.

kids maybe would want skis or

3975
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:13,770
something, he wanted computer

books.

3977
02:11:14,599 --> 02:11:16,669
He stayed in his bedroom, making

3978
02:11:16,668 --> 02:11:18,168
games while the other kids were

3979
02:11:18,169 --> 02:11:19,039
outside playing.

02:11:20,638 --> 02:11:22,378
the coding almost always we have

3982
02:11:22,373 --> 02:11:24,043
to tell my daughter to stop,

I want to get this solved first.

3987
02:11:29,047 --> 02:11:30,917
When I watch him code, his

3988
02:11:30,915 --> 02:11:34,885
eyes move in a weird way, and

3989
02:11:34,886 --> 02:11:37,256
he's like totally focused.

3990
02:11:37,255 --> 02:11:38,825
Even when my friends are over,

3991
02:11:38,823 --> 02:11:39,723

And they'd go, wow.

3994
02:11:45,063 --> 02:11:46,063
When he first came to us with

3995
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:48,564
the idea, we were like, okay,

3996
02:11:48,566 --> 02:11:50,506
good luck.

3997
02:11:50,501 --> 02:11:51,941
He started off in his small

3998
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:53,006
little one-bedroom apartment

3999
02:11:53,004 --> 02:11:54,604
with next to nothing,

4000
02:11:54,605 --> 02:11:56,705
and sacrificed eating a burger

4001
02:11:56,708 --> 02:11:58,178
and just have ramen just so that

4002
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,646
he could, and I'm like just buy

4003
02:12:00,645 --> 02:12:01,475
the burger.

4004
02:12:01,479 --> 02:12:02,309
And he's like no, that's three

4005
02:12:02,313 --> 02:12:03,413
bucks that I could put towards

4006
02:12:03,414 --> 02:12:04,244
the app.

4007
02:12:04,248 --> 02:12:06,118
Jeremy went out to build the

4008
02:12:06,117 --> 02:12:07,387
first version of Yelp, and it

4009
02:12:07,385 --> 02:12:08,655
was a total bust, a total

4010
02:12:08,653 --> 02:12:09,483
failure.

4011
02:12:09,487 --> 02:12:11,687
She tried really hard on a

4012
02:12:11,689 --> 02:12:13,629
couple different titles, and

4013
02:12:13,624 --> 02:12:14,794
you've never heard of them.

4014
02:12:14,792 --> 02:12:16,532
And, you know, that's a really

4015
02:12:16,527 --> 02:12:17,327
rough feeling.

4016
02:12:17,328 --> 02:12:18,928
That was definitely a low

4017
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:20,570
point for Jeremy because it was

4018
02:12:20,565 --> 02:12:22,735
like, hey we got to retool and

4019
02:12:22,734 --> 02:12:23,564
try again.

4020
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,138
What Jeremy did notice in the

4021
02:12:25,136 --> 02:12:26,536
data was that people loved

4022
02:12:26,537 --> 02:12:28,377
writing comments, and that was

4023
02:12:28,373 --> 02:12:30,043
really the genesis of the second

4024
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:32,081
version of Yelp, which worked.

4025
02:12:32,076 --> 02:12:33,646
You have to be really okay

4026
02:12:33,644 --> 02:12:35,184
with waking up to failure and

4027
02:12:35,179 --> 02:12:36,849
then at the end of a whole bunch

4028
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:37,848
of failures is something that's

4029
02:12:37,849 --> 02:12:39,049
great.

4030
02:12:40,051 --> 02:12:41,721
Tessa didn't really think I

4031
02:12:41,719 --> 02:12:43,159
want to make an app.

4032
02:12:43,154 --> 02:12:44,854
Tessa found a problem, a food

4033
02:12:44,856 --> 02:12:46,396
waste which you could use the

4034
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:48,061
app to help to solve.

4035
02:12:48,059 --> 02:12:49,929
Emma's grandma was diagnosed

4036
02:12:49,927 --> 02:12:51,097

4037
02:12:51,095 --> 02:12:52,435
She even forgot my daughter's

4038
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:53,560
birthday.

4039
02:12:53,564 --> 02:12:55,304
So Emma tried to search for an

4040
02:12:55,299 --> 02:12:56,069
app that would help,

4041
02:12:56,067 --> 02:12:57,067
but she couldn't find it.

4042
02:12:57,068 --> 02:13:00,108
So she said, you know, why don't

4043
02:13:00,104 --> 02:13:01,004
we just do it ourselves.

4044
02:13:01,005 --> 02:13:03,545
My husband was a diabetic.

4045
02:13:03,541 --> 02:13:07,041
That inspired Jeffrey to do

4046
02:13:07,045 --> 02:13:09,515
something about diabetes, and

4047
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:11,814
it's an answer to a lot of

4048
02:13:11,816 --> 02:13:14,086
people's prayers.

4051
02:13:18,456 --> 02:13:19,326
I couldn't believe that he made

4052
02:13:19,323 --> 02:13:20,163
it.

4053
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:21,458
I mean to me it was remarkable.

4054
02:13:21,459 --> 02:13:22,429
She pulled out her cell

4055
02:13:22,427 --> 02:13:24,427
phone, and I saw his app on her

4056
02:13:24,429 --> 02:13:25,359
phone, and I was like trying not

4057
02:13:25,363 --> 02:13:27,503
to freak out, but oh my gosh.

4058
02:13:27,498 --> 02:13:29,038
For my wife, it's not just

4059
02:13:29,033 --> 02:13:31,003
creating, it's really wanting to

4060
02:13:31,002 --> 02:13:33,102
be a part of something big.

4061
02:13:33,104 --> 02:13:34,234
The one lesson that I learned

4062
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:35,438
from Jeremy every day is just

4063
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:37,780
that determination, tenacity, to

4064
02:13:37,775 --> 02:13:38,605
focus.

4065
02:13:38,609 --> 02:13:40,479
He foresaw the impact that the

4066
02:13:40,478 --> 02:13:42,578
iPhone was going to have, and he

4067
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:43,680
bet everything on getting an app

4068
02:13:43,681 --> 02:13:44,511
for it,

4069
02:13:44,515 --> 02:13:45,485
and I think that it was one of

4070
02:13:45,483 --> 02:13:47,723
the most important things that

4071
02:13:47,718 --> 02:13:48,488
Yelp did.

4072
02:13:48,486 --> 02:13:50,856
I think he's made a big

4073
02:13:50,855 --> 02:13:52,325
difference, and so do thousands

4074

4076
02:13:55,226 --> 02:13:58,396
also teach others and it makes

4082
