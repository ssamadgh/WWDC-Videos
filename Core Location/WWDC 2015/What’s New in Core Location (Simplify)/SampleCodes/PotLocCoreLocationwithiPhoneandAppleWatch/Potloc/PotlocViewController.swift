/**
    The `PotlocViewController` is responsible for maintaining the `CLLocationManager`
    and the `WCSession`. When the watch sends a start or stop message, the `PotlocViewController`
    informs the `CLLocationManager` to act accordingly. As the location manager accumulates
    locations, the `PotlocViewController` maintains a cumulative count of how many
    locations have been received. On a five second timeout, the `PotlocViewController` sends
    the location count to the watch to be processed as needed.

    The `PotlocViewController` can also start and stop updating location using the
    `startStopUpdatingLocationButton`. When location updates are started or stopped, 
    both views are informed of the change so they can both update accordingly.

    When sending streamed information such as location updates to the watch, it
    is recommended to batch the updates and send them less frequently than received.
