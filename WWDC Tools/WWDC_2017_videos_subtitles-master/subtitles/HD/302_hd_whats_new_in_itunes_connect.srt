00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:32,506
>> Hi everyone.


4
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:34,986
My -- welcome to our session on


5
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:36,316
"What's New in iTunes Connect?"


6
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:37,796
My name is Daniel Meoh.


7
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,356
I'm an engineering manager on


8
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:39,926
iTunes Connect.


9
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:43,536
So we're going to talk about a


10
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:44,876
number of new features today.


11
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:46,906
Some of these we launched


12
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:48,386
earlier this year and the rest


13
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:49,466
will be rolling out over the


14
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,876
course of the rest of this year.


15
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:52,486
We're going to talk about


16
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,946
everything from responding to


17
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:57,366
customer reviews to new ways to


18
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,296
control how your app versions


19
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:01,526
arrive in your customers' hands.


20
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:04,426
So let's jump right in and start


21
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:05,726
by talking about ratings,


22
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:07,116
reviews, and responses.


23
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,406
Now since we did launch this a


24
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,006
few months ago, how many of you


25
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:14,976
have already used this feature?


26
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,508
[ Scattered Applause ]


27
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:20,266
Great. Well, whether you've used


28
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:22,416
this or not, I'm sure we can all


29
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,706
agree that directly engaging our


30
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:27,156
customers benefits everybody.


31
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:30,896
So before we talk about how to


32
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:33,596
respond let's take a minute to


33
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:36,056
think about why customers write


34
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:39,246
reviews in the first place.


35
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:41,826
So sometimes our customers just


36
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:44,876
love our apps and they want to


37
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:45,686
let the world know.


38
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:49,106
Other times customers may be a


39
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:51,416
little confused as to why maybe


40
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,436
you've included or not included


41
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:56,436
certain features or maybe around


42
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:57,506
design decisions you may have


43
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:58,000
made.


44
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:02,156
And finally, we're all familiar


45
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,196
with this, customers often take


46
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:06,446
to reviews to let us know about


47
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:09,166
bugs or crashes in our apps.


48
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,736
Now no matter what the reason


49
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:15,586
is, why customers write these


50
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:17,526
reviews, we have a great way for


51
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:18,246
you to respond.


52
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,986
Now here we see iTunes Connect.


53
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:23,126
This is where you've always come


54
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:24,136
to read reviews from your


55
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:26,406
customers and now this is where


56
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:27,706
you come to respond.


57
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:29,666
We're going to take a look at


58
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,166
our app, Forest Xplorer, which


59
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,946
is a fictitious app for a hiking


60
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,356
and trail navigation.


61
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,146
So let's look for a review to


62
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:38,856
respond to.


63
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:41,226
We're going to start by looking


64
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:45,086
for two-star reviews that don't


65
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:46,886
yet have any developer


66
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:47,626
responses.


67
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:51,896
And here we have one that we can


68
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:52,676
take a look at.


69
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,416
It looks like we have a customer


70
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,526
that's been using our app for a


71
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:57,616
long time and just recently she


72
00:02:57,616 --> 00:03:01,126
went hiking and found that one


73
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:02,306
of the app -- one of the trails


74
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,856
that she was on was outdated.


75
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,206
Well, it turns out we released a


76
00:03:06,206 --> 00:03:07,696
new version of our app just this


77
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:09,666
morning and it refreshes the


78
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,936
trails in her area.


79
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:13,946
So let's go ahead and let her


80
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:14,866
know that.


81
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:16,346
We'll start the process by


82
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,066
clicking the "reply" button next


83
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:21,896
to her review, which brings up


84
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:23,706
this modal where we can type in


85
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:24,446
our response.


86
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,286
Here we'll let her know that we


87
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:28,916
really appreciate her using our


88
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,276
app for so long and that she


89
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,266
should check out the new version


90
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,526
we released this morning because


91
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:34,966
it should address her concerns.


92
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:38,316
Once we hit "submit" this


93
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:40,146
response shows up right under


94
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:40,636
the review.


95
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,796
Now you may notice that the word


96
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,406
"pending" appears next to the


97
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:45,416
response title.


98
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:48,106
All this means is that this


99
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:49,666
response has not yet made it to


100
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,466
the system to show up on the App


101
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:51,806
Store.


102
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,466
Once it does this word "pending"


103
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,286
will disappear.


104
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:56,886
For those of you who are


105
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:57,986
wondering, this has nothing to


106
00:03:57,986 --> 00:03:59,106
do with app review.


107
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,586
Now one other thing to note here


108
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:06,306
is that every review only has


109
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,446
one response.


110
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,146
So your customer can update the


111
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:12,016
review as much as they like and


112
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,666
you can update your response as


113
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,776
often as you'd like, but this is


114
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,276
not a threaded conversation.


115
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:20,426
So it will only be one pairing


116
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:21,076
per customer.


117
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:25,216
Now once this response does make


118
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:27,846
it all the way to the store your


119
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,006
customer will receive a


120
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:29,826
notification.


121
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,316
This comes in the form of both a


122
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,136
push and an email notification.


123
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,476
This notification is triggered


124
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,556
when you, as a developer, submit


125
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:40,876
your initial response or update


126
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:43,046
an existing one after a customer


127
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:44,166
has updated their review.


128
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,726
Any other times you update your


129
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:51,186
response will not trigger a


130
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:51,896
notification.


131
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,996
On your end you can also opt


132
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,946
into an email notification.


133
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:00,186
This will be triggered when a


134
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:01,706
customer updates the review


135
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:02,886
after you've responded.


136
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,546
You can enable this by going


137
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,226
into the "use/enroll" section of


138
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:08,166
iTunes Connect.


139
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:11,696
All right, going back to our


140
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:14,266
scenario; here our customer has


141
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,236
tapped the "update review" link


142
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:17,676
in the email notification that


143
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:18,376
she received.


144
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,756
This gives her the chance to


145
00:05:21,036 --> 00:05:22,616
obviously update her review.


146
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,976
It takes her directly into the


147
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,406
App Store to her review.


148
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,196
So it turns out our customer has


149
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,716
updated her app and it worked


150
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:32,616
out really well for her.


151
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,456
So she's decided to update her


152
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:35,936
review to five stars.


153
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,446
Once she hits the "send" button


154
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:40,576
we have another satisfied


155
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:40,976
customer.


156
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,666
Now looking at some early stats


157
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,826
around this feature, we notice


158
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,546
that all of the reviews that


159
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:52,426
were updated after developer


160
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,616
response, it was an average of


161
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:55,916
about a one and a half star


162
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,206
increase to these reviews.


163
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:00,376
So that sounds like a great


164
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,946
reason to go out there and start


165
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:04,816
engaging your customers.


166
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:06,856
We also have a number of best


167
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,246
practices around this feature.


168
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:12,076
First, customers of course like


169
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,616
to know that they're being


170
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:15,586
listened to.


171
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,596
So stay on top of what they're


172
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,476
saying and respond in a timely


173
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:19,836
manner.


174
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:22,476
One way you can do this is to


175
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:23,886
opt into those notifications


176
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:24,806
that we were talking about


177
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:25,186
earlier.


178
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,066
That way when customers update


179
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,396
their reviews after your


180
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,006
response you can get a good


181
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:34,706
feeling of how they 're reacting


182
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:35,656
to your responses.


183
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:40,516
Next, really listen to your


184
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:42,846
customers before you respond,


185
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,306
and when you do respond, respond


186
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,636
specifically to the thing


187
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:48,686
they're talking to you about.


188
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,126
Try to stay positive and please


189
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,346
don't use this to advertise or


190
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,156
to incentivize higher ratings.


191
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:00,936
If you are responding or


192
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,916
releasing a new version that


193
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,036
addresses concerns that


194
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:05,086
customers have been talking


195
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:07,356
about, like features or bug


196
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:09,526
reports, be sure to include this


197
00:07:09,526 --> 00:07:11,146
in your "what's new" text with


198
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:11,926
your version update.


199
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:13,716
This way as many customers as


200
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,656
possible will know that you've


201
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:16,996
addressed their concerns.


202
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:18,926
You can also take this


203
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,376
opportunity to respond to those


204
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:22,386
customers so they can be


205
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:23,856
notified that a new version is


206
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,976
available to take a look at.


207
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:31,296
And finally, if you do have


208
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,146
sensitive customer information


209
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:35,846
please be mindful of the fact


210
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:38,596
that this is a public forum so


211
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:41,456
treat it that way.


212
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,006
We have a new store kit API


213
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:44,346
around this feature that allows


214
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,516
you to collect both reviews and


215
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:48,156
ratings from directly inside of


216
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:49,616
your apps without sending your


217
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,026
customers to the App Store.


218
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:52,726
So be sure to come to our


219
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:53,736
"What's New in Store Kit"


220
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:55,796
session tomorrow at 11 to find


221
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,226
out more about that.


222
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:01,186
All right, now let's talk about


223
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:01,636
test flight.


224
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:03,966
So test flight is our beta


225
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:04,916
testing platform.


226
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,356
It allows you to distribute your


227
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:09,296
prerelease app builds to testers


228
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:12,166
to vet your builds before you


229
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:13,826
distribute them to the App Store


230
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,456
at large.


231
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:15,926
Now we made a number of


232
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,286
enhancements to this platform


233
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,406
recently, both around how you


234
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:21,176
distribute builds and how you


235
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:22,056
manage testers.


236
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,056
So I'd like to invite Tom Neglen


237
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:25,356
up to the stage to talk to us


238
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:25,946
about this.


239
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:30,500
[ Applause ]


240
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,035
>> Thanks, Daniel.


241
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,416
I'm really excited to talk about


242
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:35,936
Test Flight.


243
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,236
In April, we introduced multiple


244
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:39,966
build support.


245
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:42,895
You're now able to distribute


246
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:44,326
more than one build to your


247
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:46,016
external testers at the same


248
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:46,306
time.


249
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:49,736
You can do this by organizing


250
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:51,876
your testers into groups and


251
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:54,176
assigning one or more builds to


252
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,246
each group.


253
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:58,236
Your internal iTunes Connect


254
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,556
testers will now get access to


255
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:01,776
all Test Flight builds.


256
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:03,766
So when you upload a new build


257
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,406
it's automatically made


258
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,706
available to your internal


259
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:07,206
testers.


260
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,036
We've also added individual


261
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:12,926
tester metrics so you can see


262
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:15,756
who is actively testing and who


263
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,886
is experiencing crashes.


264
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:20,186
Last, but not least, we added a


265
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,516
"tester reinvite" button.


266
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,806
It's really easy to go into


267
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,546
iTunes Connect and send a new


268
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:27,686
invite to a specific tester with


269
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:28,246
one click.


270
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:31,746
Now I'd like to show you what's


271
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:32,766
possible with these new


272
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:33,236
features.


273
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:36,716
Let's start with the simple


274
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:38,946
example of using a group to send


275
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,116
a build to your testers.


276
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:44,366
We can create a group by


277
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,726
clicking "new group" in the left


278
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:48,266
nav and giving our group a name.


279
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:50,326
We'll call this group "Beta


280
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:50,976
Testers."


281
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,036
Let's say we want to use this


282
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,826
group to test major feature


283
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:57,206
changes.


284
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,886
We might want to add our QA team


285
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,376
or other individuals who don't


286
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,916
mind finding an occasional bug.


287
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:07,936
We can add testers to the group


288
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:09,656
by clicking the plus button next


289
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,636
to "testers" and selecting "add


290
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:12,276
new testers."


291
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:17,186
All that's required to invite a


292
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:19,026
tester to our app is an email


293
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,586
address and the name is


294
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,026
optional.


295
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:27,036
So we've added some testers to


296
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,656
the group, but they won't


297
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:30,426
actually receive an invite to


298
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,406
test the app until we've also


299
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:34,106
added at least one build to the


300
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:34,376
group.


301
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:38,086
And we can do that in the


302
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:40,386
"build" sub tab by clicking the


303
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:42,686
plus button.


304
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,076
We're given a dialogue where we


305
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,726
can browse all of our builds and


306
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,576
when we select a build we're


307
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:50,256
given an opportunity to update


308
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,016
the test information before that


309
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:53,206
build goes out to testers.


310
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,976
So we could add some notes here


311
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,866
to let testers know what to look


312
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,966
for as they're testing this


313
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,066
build and if we've added a new


314
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,676
feature or made some changes to


315
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,286
an area of an app we might want


316
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:05,976
to mention that here.


317
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:10,946
And with that, the build has


318
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,266
been added to the group and will


319
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,416
be delivered to our beta


320
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:13,876
testers.


321
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,406
So let's take a look at what


322
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:17,096
testers will see.


323
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:21,506
Once they've been given access


324
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,086
to a build they receive an


325
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:25,566
invite to test the app.


326
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,656
We only send the invite once and


327
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:29,306
testers won't have access to any


328
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:30,686
builds until they accept the


329
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:31,000
invite.


330
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:34,166
So here's what the invitation


331
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,196
looks like and when testers tap


332
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,196
"view in test flight" it'll


333
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:37,966
launch the test flight app.


334
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,136
Here, testers will be able to


335
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,756
accept the invitation and


336
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,586
install the beta app.


337
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,206
They'll also be able to see the


338
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:51,876
notes we added on what to test


339
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,106
and they can provide feedback by


340
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:56,946
tapping "send feedback."


341
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,846
Now let's say our testers have


342
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,686
used our build for a while and


343
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,066
they've given us feedback about


344
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:03,776
a bug they've found.


345
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,236
We could use the feedback to fix


346
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:08,646
the bug and upload a new build.


347
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:11,036
We'll want to add the build to


348
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:14,086
our beta testers group and when


349
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:15,876
we're prompted we'll want to


350
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,116
update the test information to


351
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:18,596
let testers know that the bug


352
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,886
has been fixed.


353
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,176
Once the build is added to the


354
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,986
group, it'll be delivered to our


355
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,486
beta testers so they could


356
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:29,816
install and verify the fix.


357
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:32,086
So that's a simple way to use a


358
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,566
group to send builds to your


359
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:33,886
testers.


360
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:36,586
But aside from just finding bugs


361
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,486
in your app, you might also want


362
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:39,856
to use groups as a way to


363
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,036
collect feedback, maybe from


364
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,516
some of your power users who


365
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:44,996
like giving feedback on early


366
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:47,156
iterations or maybe from your


367
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:49,216
CEO or potential investors.


368
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,096
You likely don't want to give


369
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:53,716
them the same builds that you


370
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:54,706
give your beta testers.


371
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:56,606
You want to ensure that you've


372
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:58,336
worked out all the issues before


373
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,586
you send them a build.


374
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:02,196
We can easily do this by


375
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:04,046
creating an additional group.


376
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:06,436
Again, we'll click "new group"


377
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:08,986
in the left nav and give our


378
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:09,546
group a name.


379
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,866
We'll call this group


380
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:12,996
"stakeholders."


381
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,886
We'll add some of our power


382
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,856
users to this group and then


383
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:19,266
when we're ready, we'll take a


384
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,776
build that's been thoroughly


385
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:22,946
vetted by our beta testers and


386
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,026
add it to the stakeholders'


387
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:24,276
group.


388
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:26,276
The stable build will be


389
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,896
delivered to our stakeholders so


390
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:28,936
they could begin to provide


391
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:29,476
feedback.


392
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,016
That shows how you can use the


393
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:34,796
flexibility of groups to give


394
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,106
different builds to different


395
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,000
sets of testers.


396
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:41,216
Taking this concept further, we


397
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,446
can even create three different


398
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,986
groups and give them names like


399
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,636
"alpha," "beta," and maybe


400
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:47,386
"release candidate."


401
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,616
You could push frequent builds


402
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:52,596
to your "alpha" group and insure


403
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:54,876
that any issues are isolated to


404
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,106
the testers in that group.


405
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:58,526
As your build becomes more


406
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:00,486
stable, you could promote it to


407
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,266
the larger "beta" group.


408
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:04,866
And once you've reached the


409
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:06,016
level of confidence with the


410
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,256
stability of your build, you


411
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:08,656
could go onto promote it to the


412
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:09,696
"release candidate" group.


413
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,636
Even if you've fixed all bugs at


414
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:13,936
this point, you could still use


415
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,206
the testers in your "release


416
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:16,776
candidate" group to collect


417
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,166
further feedback before


418
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,696
releasing a final version to the


419
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:19,896
App Store.


420
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,646
Another option would be to use


421
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:28,586
groups for two separate lines of


422
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:28,976
development.


423
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:33,656
For example we can create an


424
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,316
additional group that we use


425
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,036
solely for experimental


426
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:37,546
features.


427
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:39,816
And we can ensure that the


428
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,706
builds we add to this group are


429
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:43,056
isolated from our standard


430
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,196
releases and we can control


431
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:47,246
exactly which testers get access


432
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:47,936
to these builds.


433
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,186
So I showed a couple ways to use


434
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:52,496
groups for build distribution


435
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:53,566
and I'm sure you'll come up with


436
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:53,826
more.


437
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,176
Another example that I want to


438
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:58,176
show is a way to organize


439
00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,836
testers before you even have a


440
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:00,866
build that's ready for them.


441
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:02,946
It might be nice to create a new


442
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,476
group called "WWDC."


443
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:06,936
You could add contacts that you


444
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,856
meet at the conference who might


445
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,346
later like to try a prereleased


446
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:11,246
version of your app.


447
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:13,526
They won't actually receive an


448
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,216
invite until you have a build


449
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:16,476
that's ready for them and you


450
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:16,976
add it to the group.


451
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:22,696
There's also a special default


452
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:24,246
group called "iTunes Connect


453
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:26,556
Users" and this is considered


454
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:27,626
your internal group.


455
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:31,396
Well, what does that mean?


456
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:32,956
Only members of your iTunes


457
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:35,066
Connect Team can be added as


458
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,356
testers to this group.


459
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:39,616
And unlike other groups, members


460
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:41,556
in your internal group will get


461
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:42,816
access to all test flight


462
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,166
builds.


463
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:45,226
So you might want to use this


464
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,206
for your development team or


465
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,616
those close to the development


466
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:48,886
cycle.


467
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:53,256
We've looked at a few different


468
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:54,746
ways to organize testers and


469
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,066
give them access to different


470
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:56,446
builds.


471
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,956
Let's take a look at how testers


472
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,506
can interact with the builds


473
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:04,096
that they have access to.


474
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:05,566
Once they've been given access


475
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:08,166
to a build -- I'm sorry -- in


476
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,816
the test flight app we always


477
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:11,706
show testers the latest build


478
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:14,556
that's available to them.


479
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,406
Here they can see previous


480
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,506
builds, but only ones that they


481
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:19,306
have access to.


482
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,516
They'll be able to see the notes


483
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:24,736
on what to test and they can


484
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,256
easily switch between versions


485
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:27,556
by tapping "install."


486
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,266
It's really nice to be able to


487
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,366
switch between different beta


488
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,586
versions at any time.


489
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:33,976
Our QA team really likes this.


490
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:39,326
So let's take a look at tester


491
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:39,806
management.


492
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:42,616
Back in iTunes Connect under


493
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,946
"all testers", we can see who


494
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:46,666
has accepted the invite.


495
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,336
We could sort by status to find


496
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:52,146
testers who have yet to accept


497
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:53,996
and if we want, we can send them


498
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,436
a new invite by clicking "resend


499
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:57,066
invite."


500
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:00,756
We also have a session count and


501
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,466
this will tell us how many times


502
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:04,786
each tester has used our app.


503
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:07,935
If we want to remove a tester,


504
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,256
we can easily do that by


505
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,056
clicking "edit" and selecting


506
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:12,386
the testers we'd like to remove.


507
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,736
Then we simply click "remove."


508
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,486
Now, if you remove a tester from


509
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,406
the "all testers" section, this


510
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,486
would remove that tester from


511
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:21,816
your app.


512
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,526
They'd be removed from all


513
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:25,156
groups and would no longer have


514
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:26,276
access to builds.


515
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:28,746
You could, of course, simply


516
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,186
remove a tester from a specific


517
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:32,076
group and this would just remove


518
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,746
their access to the builds in


519
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,996
that group.


520
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:39,166
Another metric that we have is


521
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,016
the crash count and this will


522
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,546
show us which testers are


523
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:43,636
experiencing problems.


524
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:45,426
And if they haven't provided


525
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:47,176
feedback already it might be a


526
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:47,956
good idea to reach out.


527
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,626
These metrics are also available


528
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:55,646
when looking at a group and the


529
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,326
numbers that you see will only


530
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,796
correlate to the builds in that


531
00:17:58,796 --> 00:17:59,000
group.


532
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,336
So when you make builds


533
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:05,296
available to testers they'll be


534
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:06,826
installable up until they


535
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:07,256
expire.


536
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:09,736
When do builds expire?


537
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:13,276
Builds will automatically expire


538
00:18:13,546 --> 00:18:15,336
90 days after they're uploaded.


539
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:18,206
You could remove a build from


540
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,016
distribution earlier by going to


541
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,286
the "build detail" page and


542
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:21,976
clicking "expire build."


543
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,496
This would prevent future


544
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:30,186
installs, but testers who have


545
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:32,196
already installed will still be


546
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,706
able to launch the app until the


547
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:34,826
original 90-day interval is


548
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:34,976
reached.


549
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:40,556
Also keep in mind you're


550
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:42,606
currently limited to 2000


551
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,656
external testers.


552
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:46,276
Later this year we're going to


553
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,886
be increasing that number and


554
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,086
we'll be increasing it to


555
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:50,706
10,000.

557
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,406
We're really excited about this.


558
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:00,646
So those are just a few tips to


559
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:02,176
mention when using Test Flight


560
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:03,516
to distribute prereleased


561
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:04,856
versions of your app.


562
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,386
You can find many more in the


563
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:08,236
"Developer Guide" and you'll


564
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,706
also find a link to the Test


565
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:11,136
Flight Release Notes, where you


566
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:12,326
can stay informed on new


567
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:14,406
features and future STK support.


568
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:16,526
With that I'll give the stage


569
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:17,176
back to Daniel.

So those are some great new


574
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:29,856
features we've added to Test


575
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:32,456
Flight including the ability to


576
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,356
distribute multiple builds to


577
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:37,496
testers at the same time, group


578
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:40,096
testers and distribute builds to


579
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,626
those groups, and of course the


580
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:45,236
increase from 2000 to 10,000


581
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:45,826
testers.


582
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:49,496
All right, now let's move on to


583
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,356
talking about the new App Store.


584
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,546
Now you've been hearing about


585
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:54,546
this all week.


586
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,366
We've gone back and we've


587
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:57,646
redesigned the App Store from


588
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:58,226
scratch.


589
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,426
And we've done this not just to


590
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:03,066
make it easier for customers to


591
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:05,906
discover new apps, but also to


592
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,536
surface the rich culture around


593
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:09,566
our app ecosystem that exists


594
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:09,946
even today.


595
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:16,466
It all begins on the "today"


596
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:16,816
tab.


597
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:20,326
This tab is a daily destination


598
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,186
that contains a collection of


599
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,856
apps that are curated by our


600
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,866
editorial team into stories.


601
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,596
These stories tell customers not


602
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,546
just what apps they love, but


603
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,296
why they would love them.


604
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:37,576
By clicking or tapping on any of


605
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:39,726
the icons on the "today" tab or


606
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:40,916
anywhere else around the App


607
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,706
Store you see the product page.


608
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,766
The product page is the home for


609
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,756
one of our apps.


610
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,166
Now the changes that have


611
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,756
happened around iTunes Connect


612
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:52,836
that effect the new App Store


613
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:55,236
mostly surface on this page.


614
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,046
So let's take a look at some of


615
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:57,756
these changes.


616
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:00,756
First we'll take a look at the


617
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:01,466
app icon.


618
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,586
Beginning with iOS 11 and Xcode


619
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:06,596
9, you'll no longer be managing


620
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:08,446
your app icon in iTunes Connect.


621
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,016
Instead you'll be including your


622
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:14,216
icon in the asset catalogue of


623
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:14,976
your app binary.


624
00:21:15,516 --> 00:21:20,500
[ Applause ]


625
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,396
Along with this change you'll be


626
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:24,006
able to deliver wide gamut


627
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,206
images for your icons that will


628
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:28,296
be displayed in full fidelity on


629
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:29,626
all supported devices.


630
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,196
And if you're working with


631
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:35,166
multiple color spaces you can


632
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,756
take advantage of Xcode's color


633
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:39,076
management features to make sure


634
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:41,996
your icons display accurately on


635
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,436
all your target devices.


636
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,946
And thanks to app thinning you


637
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,086
won't have to worry about the


638
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:49,416
binary being delivered to your


639
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,016
customer being unnecessarily


640
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,356
large just because you've


641
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:52,976
included an icon.


642
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:58,156
Next, let's talk about the


643
00:21:58,156 --> 00:21:58,996
subtitle field.


644
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,766
The subtitle is a new field


645
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:04,126
that's meant to be a brief


646
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,966
summary of your app's experience


647
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,756
in a concise and compelling way.


648
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:11,726
This field is up to 30


649
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:13,226
characters in length and it's


650
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:14,696
meant to compliment your app


651
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:15,016
name.


652
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:17,266
This means whenever your app


653
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,796
name shows up around the store


654
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:21,256
your subtitle shows up along


655
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:21,576
with it.


656
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:23,736
This could be the product page


657
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:25,226
or the search page or any of the


658
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:25,926
new tabs.


659
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:28,366
Now many of you already include


660
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:29,916
this information today with your


661
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:30,366
apps.


662
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,796
Your app name may look like


663
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:33,500
this.


664
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,066
Well, with the new subtitle


665
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,216
field you can move this


666
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,166
information out of your app name


667
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:42,096
and really highlight your brand


668
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:43,086
and let your app names


669
00:22:43,086 --> 00:22:45,616
standalone without sacrificing


670
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,736
searchability or the context


671
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:48,846
that the subtitle brings.


672
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:53,906
As we move further down on the


673
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,556
product page, we get to app


674
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:56,106
previews.


675
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:59,596
With the new App Store you can


676
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:01,566
submit up to three app previews


677
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:05,006
and that's three previews per


678
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:05,656
language.


679
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:08,736
As your customers browse the


680
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:11,116
store, your previews will


681
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,466
automatically play bringing your


682
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,506
apps to life and immediately


683
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:16,126
engaging your customers.


684
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:21,156
Below app previews, we see the


685
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:25,166
description and prepended to


686
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,326
this description is a


687
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:28,586
promotional text field.


688
00:23:29,646 --> 00:23:30,936
In iTunes Connect, you'll find


689
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:32,656
this new field that's always


690
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:35,446
editable and is meant to contain


691
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,176
frequently changing information.


692
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:40,416
Today, you might let people know


693
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,466
that your app is free for a


694
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:44,106
limited time or maybe 40 percent


695
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,316
off for a holiday weekend.


696
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:49,086
Well, in the future, your


697
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:50,986
description will be locked after


698
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:53,666
app review, so please use this


699
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,836
field for this kind of


700
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:55,386
information.


701
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:59,656
And we have one more exciting


702
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:01,346
feature that we'd like to talk


703
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,126
about that allows to surface


704
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:05,026
your in-app purchases directly


705
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,646
on the App Store and let your


706
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:07,976
customers interact with those in


707
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,366
app purchases right away.


708
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:11,656
I'd like to invite Will Avrell


709
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:12,666
up to the stage to tell you more


710
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:12,976
about it.


711
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:19,500
[ Applause ]


712
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:20,646
>> Thanks, Daniel.


713
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:23,036
We're extremely pleased to


714
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,486
announce that for the first time


715
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:26,496
we're making in app purchases


716
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,116
discoverable on the App Store.


717
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:28,806
[applause] Yeah!


718
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:31,336
[applause] Give it up!


719
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,046
[applause] In addition,


720
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:36,056
customers will be able to start


721
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,376
their in app purchase right on


722
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,986
the App Store and be taken


723
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:40,506
directly to your app to complete


724
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:41,166
the purchase.


725
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:42,986
Overall, we feel like this is a


726
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:44,496
terrific way for developers to


727
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,376
gain additional exposure for


728
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:47,546
their in-app purchases on the


729
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:47,966
App Store.


730
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:50,466
So with that said, let's take a


731
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:51,646
dive in and look at where


732
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,266
promoted in-app purchases will


733
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:55,566
be discoverable on the new App


734
00:24:56,636 --> 00:24:56,756
Store.


735
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:58,916
So the first place that Daniel


736
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,306
talked about is the product


737
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:00,746
page.


738
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:02,586
As you scroll down the product


739
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,936
page, you'll find your promoted


740
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,956
in app purchases broken up in


741
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:08,076
two -- into two distinct lists;


742
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,096
your subscriptions and all


743
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:11,566
in-app purchase -- all other


744
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:12,586
in-app purchase types.


745
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,636
It's important to note here that


746
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:16,766
you are limited to 20 in app


747
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,916
purchases per app.


748
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,346
Also unique to the product page


749
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:23,186
view is the ability to customize


750
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:24,656
the order and visibility of your


751
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,646
promoted in-app purchases as


752
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:27,976
they appear on your product


753
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:28,296
page.


754
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:30,286
This means you can do things


755
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:32,026
like hide subscriptions the user


756
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:33,196
already has purchased on the


757
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:35,126
device or if you have a puzzle


758
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,276
game, you can show the most


759
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:37,986
relevant levels earlier in the


760
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:38,356
list.


761
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,726
So for example, if the customer


762
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:42,336
just beat level two in your game


763
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:43,736
-- your puzzle game -- you can


764
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:44,896
make sure that level three is


765
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:45,936
the first thing that they see in


766
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:46,496
this list.


767
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:50,656
So moving on, promoted in app


768
00:25:50,656 --> 00:25:53,076
purchases are now searchable on


769
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:54,956
the App Store.


770
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:56,446
This means you can go to this


771
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:58,216
search tab and you can search by


772
00:25:58,216 --> 00:25:59,796
the name or description of your


773
00:25:59,796 --> 00:26:01,236
promoted in-app purchase and see


774
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:01,976
some results.


775
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,386
Also we're adding a new


776
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:06,536
"trending" section for promoted


777
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:07,546
in-app purchase searches,


778
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:09,826
similar to what exists today for


779
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:10,916
apps.


780
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:13,896
And finally, promoted in-app


781
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,656
purchases are eligible to be


782
00:26:15,696 --> 00:26:16,826
featured by the App Store


783
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:17,606
editorial team.


784
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:20,116
This means that your app could


785
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:23,136
be featured on the "today" apps


786
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,246
or games tab.


787
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:28,006
In this section, you get a nice


788
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:29,176
little write up about your


789
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,986
promoted in app purchase and


790
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,286
tapping anything but the "buy"


791
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,476
button here will forward you to


792
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,536
the product page whereas


793
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:36,906
clicking on the "buy" button


794
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,236
will open the app and complete


795
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:38,856
the purchase.


796
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:42,186
So, I've talked a lot about what


797
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,526
promoted in-app purchases are


798
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:44,856
and where they appear on the new


799
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:47,156
App Store, but let's discuss


800
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:48,456
what you as a developer need to


801
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:51,066
do to implement and make an


802
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,606
in-app purchase a promoted


803
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:53,336
in-app purchase.


804
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,096
So we've broken this down into


805
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:58,256
three steps, the first two of


806
00:26:58,256 --> 00:26:59,376
which are managed in iTunes


807
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:02,236
Connect, but critically you must


808
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,956
define some promotional data for


809
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:07,346
your promoted in-app purchase.


810
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:09,796
This is an image, a name, and a


811
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,456
description.


812
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,806
So these are the three pieces of


813
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:14,436
information that are surfaced


814
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,746
and visible on the App Store and


815
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,326
because that's the case, they


816
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:19,936
must be reviewed by the app


817
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,476
review team.


818
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:22,986
Also, you might be familiar with


819
00:27:22,986 --> 00:27:24,396
name and description, as these


820
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:25,606
are fields that exist today in


821
00:27:25,696 --> 00:27:27,246
iTunes Connect, but we've


822
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,256
adjusted the limits slightly and


823
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,916
the new character limits are 30


824
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,436
and 45 respectively.


825
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,336
So once you've set up your


826
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:36,586
promotional data in iTunes


827
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:38,466
Connect you need to configure


828
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:40,416
your in app purchase and you


829
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,786
need to do things like activate


830
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:42,756
it so we know to count it


831
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,266
against your limit of 20 and you


832
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:47,056
need to set a default order and


833
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,646
visibility for your promoted


834
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:50,186
in-app purchase as it would


835
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:53,006
appear on the product page.


836
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:55,056
Lastly, you need to implement


837
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:56,926
some store kit APIs, well just


838
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,986
one, but it is absolutely


839
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:00,596
critical that you implement a


840
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,736
single delegate method on the SK


841
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:04,656
Payment Transaction Observer


842
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:05,336
Protocol.


843
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:07,326
If you do not implement this


844
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:08,456
single delegate method, your


845
00:28:08,816 --> 00:28:10,406
promoted in app purchases will


846
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:13,266
not appear on the App Store.


847
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:14,996
So I mentioned the ability to


848
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:16,236
customize the order and


849
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,226
visibility of your promoted


850
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:18,876
in-app purchases as they appear


851
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:20,636
on the product page and that is


852
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:22,086
accomplished through the SK


853
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,586
Products Store Promotion


854
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:24,416
Controller API.


855
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:27,026
So again, like I said, using


856
00:28:27,026 --> 00:28:28,966
this API, you can show more


857
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,016
relevant promoted in app


858
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:31,516
purchases on your product page.


859
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:33,346
I won't go into too much detail


860
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:34,816
about how to implement this in


861
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:38,296
code or the impressive array of


862
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,946
options you can do with this


863
00:28:39,946 --> 00:28:42,366
optional store kit API, but be


864
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:43,776
sure to check out the "What's


865
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:44,906
New in Store Kits" session,


866
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,326
which is tomorrow at 11 a.m. to


867
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:48,596
figure out more about how to use


868
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:49,966
these APIs and how to implement


869
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:50,156
them.


870
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,846
So as I mentioned, the first two


871
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:54,526
portions of implementing a


872
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:55,856
promoted in-app purchase is done


873
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:57,846
in iTunes Connect and I'd like


874
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,596
to take this moment to demo for


875
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:01,266
you exactly what it will look


876
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:02,366
like to set up an in-app


877
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:03,866
purchase as a promoted in-app


878
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,346
purchase when this feature


879
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:05,976
launches later this summer.


880
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:12,426
So hopefully everyone's familiar


881
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:13,566
with this view, but all I've


882
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:15,596
done at this point is go to the


883
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,266
iTunes Connect website and log


884
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,116
in with my user name and


885
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:18,576
password.


886
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:21,666
So from here we're going to


887
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,226
click on the "my apps" module


888
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:25,906
and that'll take us to iTunes


889
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,146
Connect and our my apps page


890
00:29:27,146 --> 00:29:28,146
where you get a nice little list


891
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,136
of all of our apps.


892
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,196
So we've been talking about


893
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:34,346
Forest Xplorer and, in fact, we


894
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:35,946
just launched a brand new


895
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:37,016
subscription called Pro


896
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:38,376
Subscription and we'd like to


897
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,936
make this promoted and visible


898
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:40,646
on the App Store.


899
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:42,316
So the first step here is to


900
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:44,366
click on the Forest Xplorer app.


901
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:46,356
This takes us into the app


902
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,326
information view where we see


903
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:49,456
some global information about


904
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:50,396
our app as a whole.


905
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:51,796
We can set our name, our


906
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:54,356
subtitle, change the category.


907
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:55,676
But this isn't really what we're


908
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:57,046
concerned with here so we're


909
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,276
going to click on the "features"


910
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:00,516
tab and clicking the "features"


911
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:01,946
tab automatically selects the


912
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:03,846
in-app purchase left nav here


913
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:05,546
and this takes us to all of our


914
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:06,556
in-app -- purchases for the


915
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,006
Forest Xplorer app.


916
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,156
Again, I'm really concerned with


917
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:11,816
the Pro Subscription so I'm


918
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:12,476
going to go ahead and click on


919
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:12,976
"Pro Subscription."


920
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:17,816
Doing so took me into the in-app


921
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,976
purchase detail view and as we


922
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:21,736
scroll down this page a lot of


923
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,716
this should be familiar to you


924
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:23,776
if you've used in app purchases


925
00:30:23,776 --> 00:30:25,516
in iTunes Connect, but there's a


926
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:26,936
brand new section which is


927
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:28,816
called App Store Promotion and


928
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:30,166
this is how we begin setting up


929
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,766
our in app purchase to be a


930
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:32,996
promoted in-app purchase.


931
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:35,256
So the first thing we have to do


932
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:36,406
is upload an image.


933
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:37,496
So I'm going to go ahead and


934
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:39,726
click "choose file" and perfect,


935
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:40,906
my image is ready right here.


936
00:30:41,396 --> 00:30:42,216
Let's just take a look.


937
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:42,986
Yeah, that looks good.


938
00:30:44,116 --> 00:30:45,586
So we'll select this and


939
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:47,386
immediately you'll notice that


940
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:49,266
our image was masked and is now


941
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,406
shown right next to our name and


942
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:51,966
description.


943
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:54,186
So this gives us a nice little


944
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,476
preview of what our promoted


945
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:56,526
in-app purchase will look like


946
00:30:56,526 --> 00:30:57,226
on the App Store.


947
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,316
Again, I'll just mention that


948
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,676
since these three pieces of data


949
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,016
are surfaced on the App Store


950
00:31:02,316 --> 00:31:03,696
they must be reviewed, even


951
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,196
though our Pro Subscription in


952
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,646
app purchase is already approved


953
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:09,756
and ready for sale.


954
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,426
Additionally I'll talk to this


955
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:13,456
checkbox right here, which is


956
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,726
your default visibility.


957
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:17,526
So in our case we have no plans


958
00:31:17,566 --> 00:31:18,946
to implement the optional store


959
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:19,416
kit API.


960
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:21,456
So it's best for us to leave


961
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:22,646
this checked because if we were


962
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:23,826
to uncheck this and not


963
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:25,796
implement the store kit API, we


964
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:26,706
would never override the


965
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:27,896
visibility of false and it would


966
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:29,016
never be displayed on the App


967
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:29,296
Store.


968
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:30,326
So I'm going to go ahead and


969
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:31,066
leave that checked.


970
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:33,986
Also, I noticed when I uploaded


971
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,456
my image, my name and


972
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,276
description field changed colors


973
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:38,886
and that's because we introduced


974
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:40,216
new limits for these fields.


975
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:42,186
So my old name and description


976
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,436
are longer than the allowable


977
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:44,756
limits.


978
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:45,666
So I'm going to go ahead and


979
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:46,036
edit these.


980
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:47,886
So I'm going to make this just


981
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:48,976
Pro Subscription.


982
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,226
And I'm going to remove the


983
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:54,916
duration from the description


984
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:55,596
here.


985
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:57,476
So that's great.


986
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:58,696
I'm now under the limits for


987
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,176
both of these fields and I can


988
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:01,336
go ahead and click "save."


989
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:03,976
So I've set up the promotional


990
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:05,196
data for this in-app purchase


991
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,016
and I'm almost there, but I do


992
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:07,916
need to configure it.


993
00:32:08,556 --> 00:32:09,556
To configure this in-app


994
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:10,966
purchase and really make it a


995
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:12,676
promoted in app purchase I need


996
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:13,766
to go to the App Store


997
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,036
promotions navigation here on


998
00:32:15,036 --> 00:32:17,226
the left and this takes me to a


999
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,386
list of all my in app purchases


1000
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,886
that have promotional data


1001
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:21,826
associated with them.


1002
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:23,406
So you can see my Pro


1003
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:24,506
Subscription was added to the


1004
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,106
very top of this list, but it's


1005
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:27,516
not yet active, which means it


1006
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:28,756
will not be displayed on the App


1007
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:29,026
Store.


1008
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:31,356
So to activate my Pro


1009
00:32:31,356 --> 00:32:32,796
Subscription, I simply click on


1010
00:32:32,796 --> 00:32:34,366
the checkbox here and you'll


1011
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,456
notice that clicking the


1012
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:36,926
checkbox automatically gave it a


1013
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:37,866
sort position of one.


1014
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:40,276
So these orderings or sort


1015
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:41,716
positions are manageable by


1016
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:44,056
sliding each of these boxes.


1017
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:45,216
So I'm going to move it down to


1018
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:45,626
two.


1019
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:47,176
I'll move it down to three.


1020
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:50,366
And you can also click this


1021
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:51,416
arrow, which will conveniently


1022
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,426
take you to the very top of the


1023
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:53,266
list automatically.


1024
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:56,156
So as I mentioned, you are


1025
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:58,286
limited to 20 active promoted


1026
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,166
in-app purchases per app, but


1027
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,546
you can have as many set up with


1028
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,856
promotional data as you want.


1029
00:33:03,226 --> 00:33:04,366
So potentially this list could


1030
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,806
get very long and to help manage


1031
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:07,886
that, we have a filter right


1032
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:08,446
here to the right.


1033
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,186
So you can filter promoted and


1034
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:12,536
not promoted in-app purchases.


1035
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:15,376
So we like the way this looks.


1036
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,366
We want our Pro Subscription


1037
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:17,566
number one in the list so we're


1038
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:18,526
going to go ahead and click


1039
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:18,936
"save."


1040
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,626
And that's how easy it is to set


1041
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:23,066
up a promoted in app purchase in


1042
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:23,876
iTunes Connect.


1043
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,266
At this point I'd like to give


1044
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:26,366
the stage back to Daniel.


1045
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:26,976
Thank you for your time.


1046
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:32,500
[ Applause ]


1047
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:39,736
>> Thanks, Will.


1048
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:44,276
So the ability to promote in app


1049
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:46,046
purchases will be available for


1050
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,346
all in app purchase types.


1051
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:50,126
And whether you have an iOS or a


1052
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:51,856
universal app you'll be able to


1053
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:53,346
take advantage of this feature.


1054
00:33:54,606 --> 00:33:56,106
And, just like the rest of the


1055
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:58,216
new App Store, this will be


1056
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,246
available in iOS 11.


1057
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:04,346
Now let's move on to phased


1058
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:04,966
release.


1059
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:07,846
Now imagine with me for a minute


1060
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:10,295
that you're about to release a


1061
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:12,275
great new version of your app to


1062
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:12,746
the store.


1063
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:14,775
You put it through an extended


1064
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,866
period of beta testing and


1065
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,686
you've subjected it to multiple


1066
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:19,866
rounds of low testing.


1067
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:22,255
The moment you release it to the


1068
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:25,156
store, you watch your production


1069
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:26,755
environment crumble.


1070
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:30,926
Now we understand that


1071
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,636
production is always a unique


1072
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:36,136
environment, no matter how much


1073
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:36,906
testing you've done.


1074
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,136
And that's why we built Phase


1075
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:40,556
Release.


1076
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:42,926
So let's take a look at how this


1077
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:43,446
works.


1078
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:48,755
When you choose a version to be


1079
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,966
enabled for Phase Release and


1080
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,186
you push that version to this


1081
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:54,416
App Store, that version is


1082
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:56,946
available immediately, just like


1083
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:58,046
any version is today.


1084
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,006
So if a customer goes to the App


1085
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,666
Store and does a manual update


1086
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:04,276
or downloads that app for the


1087
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:05,446
first time they will be


1088
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:06,866
receiving this newest version.


1089
00:35:07,926 --> 00:35:09,196
Now the difference with Phase


1090
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:12,156
Release is that users who


1091
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:13,926
receive this version over


1092
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:16,866
automatic updates will receive


1093
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,886
it over a gradual seven-day


1094
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:19,566
period.


1095
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:23,946
So on day one up to one percent


1096
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:25,176
of your customers who are


1097
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:26,646
receiving this over automatic


1098
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:27,996
updates will have this available


1099
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:28,296
to them.


1100
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:30,666
By day two you'll be up to two


1101
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,136
percent.


1102
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:33,716
By day four; 10 percent.


1103
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:36,046
And when they get to day seven,


1104
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:38,466
all of your customers who are


1105
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:39,936
using automatic updates will


1106
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:40,906
have this latest version


1107
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:41,396
available.


1108
00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:44,166
Now remember, if any of these


1109
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,646
customers do go directly to the


1110
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,636
App Store to either update or to


1111
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:48,816
download for the first time,


1112
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,846
during this period they will


1113
00:35:50,846 --> 00:35:52,326
receive the latest version right


1114
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:52,656
away.


1115
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,236
So let's look at how we might


1116
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:56,646
set this up in iTunes Connect.


1117
00:35:57,926 --> 00:35:59,106
So let's say we're about to


1118
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:00,816
release a brand new version of


1119
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:03,006
our Forest Xplorer app and we'd


1120
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:04,186
like to use Phase Release.


1121
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:07,836
In order to do this, before we


1122
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,806
release this version, we can go


1123
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:10,906
to the bottom of our version


1124
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:12,646
page and choose "release over a


1125
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:13,546
seven-day period."


1126
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,216
Once we've done this and the


1127
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,556
version is available on the


1128
00:36:17,556 --> 00:36:20,086
store this area changes and we


1129
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,156
see a day counter instead.


1130
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:25,216
Under each day is a maximum


1131
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,386
number of customers who will


1132
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,766
receive this over automatic


1133
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:29,626
updates.


1134
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:33,156
Now let's say on day three we


1135
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,456
realize that we have some


1136
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,766
concerns about production.


1137
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:38,626
At this point, we'd like to


1138
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,856
pause our phase release.


1139
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:42,256
In order to do this, we simply


1140
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,086
choose "pause phase release"


1141
00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:45,516
from the radio buttons in this


1142
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:48,856
area and then this area turns


1143
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:49,256
gray.


1144
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:51,956
This means that no more of our


1145
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,566
customers are receiving this


1146
00:36:53,616 --> 00:36:55,966
over automatic updates while


1147
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:56,576
we're paused.


1148
00:36:57,646 --> 00:36:58,856
If customers go directly to the


1149
00:36:58,856 --> 00:37:00,876
store, they will continue being


1150
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:02,496
able to pull the latest version.


1151
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:07,146
Now eight days later, we've


1152
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:08,916
addressed our performance issues


1153
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:10,986
and we're ready to resume our


1154
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:11,466
release.


1155
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,896
So we simply, at this point,


1156
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:14,826
choose "resume phase release"


1157
00:37:15,846 --> 00:37:16,816
and we're back in motion.


1158
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:20,666
Now we come to day five and


1159
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,266
we're confident that our


1160
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:24,236
production environment is ready


1161
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:25,436
to handle the full load.


1162
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:27,476
So we'd like to release this to


1163
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:29,756
all of our customers right away.


1164
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:33,136
In order to do this, we choose


1165
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:34,716
"release to all users" in the


1166
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:36,416
top right corner of the page and


1167
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:37,926
once we confirm this decision,


1168
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:40,566
this version is now available to


1169
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:41,856
all of our customers.


1170
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:45,336
The phase release is available


1171
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:47,976
to you today and no matter --


1172
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:54,646
[ Applause ]


1173
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:57,036
And no matter which version of


1174
00:37:57,036 --> 00:37:58,436
iOS your customers are using,


1175
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:01,036
you can use this feature with


1176
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:04,166
all of them.


1177
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:05,366
And that's Phase Release.


1178
00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:07,356
So we'd like to close out our


1179
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:08,956
session as we do every year,


1180
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,606
with some tips from app review


1181
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:12,906
about how to get your versions


1182
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:13,876
through review a little more


1183
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:14,456
smoothly.


1184
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,406
So we'll start by talking about


1185
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,276
making sure your app functions


1186
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:21,906
throughout the review process.


1187
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,026
Now a lot of us have external


1188
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:27,556
services that our apps depend on


1189
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:29,046
to function correctly.


1190
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:31,346
So please make sure your


1191
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:32,986
external services continue to


1192
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:35,126
function, otherwise we can't


1193
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:37,156
complete the review of your apps


1194
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:39,506
that depend on them.


1195
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:42,186
Next, please run your versions


1196
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:44,626
on an actual device before you


1197
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:45,056
submit.


1198
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:48,786
Running on a simulator is not an


1199
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:49,566
actual device.


1200
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:53,566
Next, if there is any sign-in


1201
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:54,646
information that your app


1202
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,966
requires, please include this on


1203
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:57,866
the version page.


1204
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,966
We do get a lot of submissions


1205
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:01,266
where the sign in information is


1206
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:02,836
either missing or it's out of


1207
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:03,126
date.


1208
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:05,046
So when you do move from version


1209
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:07,026
to version please make sure that


1210
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:08,826
this information is current.


1211
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:13,806
If there are any obscure parts


1212
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,996
of your apps or just areas that


1213
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:17,706
are difficult to get to, please


1214
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:18,756
let us know in your app review


1215
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,216
notes.


1216
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:20,486
If there's anything else we


1217
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:21,346
should know about your app,


1218
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:22,466
please feel free to use your


1219
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:23,706
field -- this field for that as


1220
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:23,976
well.


1221
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:28,746
And our binary compatibility


1222
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:31,016
team may reach out to you over


1223
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:32,886
resolution center if they have


1224
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:35,076
any concerns about your binary


1225
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:36,746
being compatible with say the


1226
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:37,106
OS.


1227
00:39:37,566 --> 00:39:39,056
So don't be concerned if they do


1228
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:40,666
happen to send you a message.


1229
00:39:41,236 --> 00:39:44,616
And finally, please use keywords


1230
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,546
that are relevant for your apps


1231
00:39:47,116 --> 00:39:48,656
and keywords that you have the


1232
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:50,076
rights to use.


1233
00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:53,536
[laughter] And those are some


1234
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:54,456
notes from app review.


1235
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:57,746
So in conclusion, we've talked


1236
00:39:57,746 --> 00:39:59,226
about many new features that


1237
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:00,556
change the way you work with


1238
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:02,406
your apps, from new ways to


1239
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:04,186
distribute builds during beta


1240
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:06,716
testing to new controls over how


1241
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:08,386
you release your app versions to


1242
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:09,236
your customers.


1243
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:12,116
And once your apps are on the


1244
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:14,276
store we've created a new way


1245
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:15,836
for your customers to discover


1246
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:17,826
your apps and when your


1247
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:19,286
customers are ready to leave you


1248
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:21,146
feedback you now have new


1249
00:40:21,146 --> 00:40:22,546
avenues to engage those


1250
00:40:22,576 --> 00:40:24,586
customers and respond to their


1251
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:25,166
feedback.


1252
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:27,896
For more information about what


1253
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:30,786
we've talked about today and any

1255
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:34,496
review, guideline updates, or


1256
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,236
changes to sales and trends


1257
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,696

visit this link.


1259
00:40:41,536 --> 00:40:43,316
We also have a number of related


1260
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:43,836
sessions.


1261
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:45,896
If you are curious about how to


1262
00:40:45,896 --> 00:40:47,606
work with your app icons in


1263
00:40:47,606 --> 00:40:49,786
Xcode, please check out the


1264
00:40:49,786 --> 00:40:51,166

1265
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:52,286
Session Recording?"


1266
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:54,886
We also had a great new session


1267
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,066
this morning that went into the


1268
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,486
design philosophy and the


1269
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:00,126
general thinking around the new


1270
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,196
App Store this morning called


1271
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:03,456
"Introducing the New App Store."


1272
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:05,166
So if you haven't seen that, be


1273
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,516
sure to check that out because


1274
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:07,616
it's very interesting.


1275
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:10,626
And tomorrow we have two store


1276
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:11,796
kit sessions; "What's New in


1277
00:41:11,796 --> 00:41:12,416
Store Kit?"


1278
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:13,756
and "Advanced Store Kit."


1279
00:41:14,756 --> 00:41:15,796
So if you want to learn more


1280
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:17,746
about the API side of the


1281
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:18,996
features we talked about today,


1282
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:20,586
come to those sessions.


1283
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:24,066
Thank you for attending our


1284
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,876
session and we hope that you


1285
00:41:25,876 --> 00:41:26,496
enjoy the rest of your


1286
00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:26,976
conference.
