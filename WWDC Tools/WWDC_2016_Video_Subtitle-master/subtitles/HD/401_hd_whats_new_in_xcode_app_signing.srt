2
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:25,026
>> Hi, good morning.


3
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:26,676
Thanks.


4
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:30,586
[ Applause ]


5
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:33,256
Welcome to What's
New in Xcode Signing.


6
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,566
Signing your apps
can be complicated.


7
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:37,886
We understand this.


8
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:40,016
And what you need to know is,


9
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:44,816
in Xcode 8 we've made it really
easy and fast to manage signing.


10
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,646
In fact, it's automatic.


11
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:50,766
And on the other hand,
if you want 100% control


12
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,206
over what Xcode does and
when it signs your apps,


13
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:55,466
you now have that as an option.


14
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:59,146
And Xcode won't modify
or create profiles.


15
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:06,546
[ Applause ]


16
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,606
Signing identifies you to users.


17
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:13,546
And they know that when they
get your app, it came from you


18
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:16,896
and it hasn't been
tampered with.


19
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,786
Signing also prevents
spoofing your apps.


20
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:23,426
When you register your bundle
ID with the developer website,


21
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:28,346
another developer team can't
come along and use that one.


22
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:32,186
Signing also allows
access to system services


23
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,326
like iCloud internet payments.


24
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:38,746
We're going to go over
four things today.


25
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:41,256
We're going to start
out by talking


26
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,156
about the fundamentals
of signing.


27
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,426
What do you need in
order to sign your apps?


28
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:51,766
After that, we'll talk
about some exciting changes


29
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,326
that we've made involving
setting up new machines


30
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,576
with signing certificates.


31
00:01:57,046 --> 00:02:00,436
Today, you have to do things
like sync private keys.


32
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:03,106
Or revoke and recreate
certificates.


33
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,806
And that's a thing of the past.


34
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:11,316
Yeah [applause] you're
going to love that.


35
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,266
And after that, we're
going to introduce you


36
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:18,446
to some new workflows that makes
managing signing really easy.


37
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,936
And we'll finish by talking
about some best practices


38
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:23,626
with setting up your projects.


39
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,206
Let's talk about
the fundamentals.


40
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:31,086
Now when Xcode builds
and signs your app,


41
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:34,866
behind the scenes it uses
a tool called codesign.


42
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,776
Now if you're new, you don't
need to think about this.


43
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:41,416
Xcode does this for
you automatically.


44
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:44,536
And if you're experienced, you
might be wondering, signing.


45
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:45,786
How does it work?


46
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,906
Well, we use this codesign tool.


47
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:51,766
And what codesign does is,
it takes your app's bundle


48
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:53,786
and applies a code seal.


49
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,336
And this allows the
system to detect changes


50
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,466
that have been made after
the app has been signed.


51
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:06,046
So if someone messes with your
app, it won't install or launch.


52
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:12,026
Codesign also applies a code
signature to the application.


53
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:13,976
So it can be identified.


54
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:17,066
And people know where
the app came from.


55
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:24,096
There are three things that you
need in order to sign your apps.


56
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:27,386
The first thing is a
signing certificate.


57
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:31,786
Signing certificates establish
your identity as a developer.


58
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:36,376
Provisioning profiles
are all about your apps,


59
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:37,846
and they grant permissions.


60
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:43,136
And entitlements declare
support for capabilities.


61
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,876
Like iCloud or Wallet.


62
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,006
So certificates.


63
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:50,206
These are issued by Apple.


64
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,946
And this is important because
the device needs a trust chain


65
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:57,206
back to Apple so it
can install the app.


66
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:00,526
And certificates
come in two forms.


67
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,666
You have development
certificates,


68
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:04,626
which are for build and run.


69
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,216
And you have distribution
certificates.


70
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:08,466
Which are used


71
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,716
for authentication
with iTunes Connect.


72
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:14,296
Or, if these are
enterprise certificates,


73
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,435
it's for distribution to users.


74
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:22,466
And all signing certificates
require a private key.


75
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:25,556
This private key has
to be in the keychain


76
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:28,026
if you want to sign your apps.


77
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:31,446
And the private key for
a certificate is created


78
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,276
when the certificate
gets generated.


79
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:36,206
And so it's very important
to have this private key.


80
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,836
And it's worth noting here


81
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:42,056
that Apple never has a
copy of your private keys.


82
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:45,036
You can't go to the developer
website and download them.


83
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,216
Now the good news
is, in Xcode 8,


84
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:51,836
for your development
certificates, you don't need


85
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,066
to worry about this anymore.


86
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:57,106
And we'll talk more
about that in a second.


87
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,176
Provisioning profiles
are also issued by Apple.


88
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,646
And in contrast to
certificates which are all


89
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:05,616
about your identity
as a developer,


90
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,826
the profiles are
all about your apps.


91
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,856
Profiles allow access to
things like running on devices.


92
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,396
There's a list of
identifiers in a profile.


93
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:22,156
And at install time, the
device runs down those list


94
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,936
of identifiers to check
if yours is included.


95
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:28,006
And if it is, you
can install the app.


96
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:33,066
Profiles also allow
access to entitlements.


97
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:36,406
There's a white list of
entitlements in a profile.


98
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,436
And if you want to
use an entitlement,


99
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,416
it has to be in that list.


100
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,116
Now once again, if you're new,


101
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,666
you don't need to
think about this.


102
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,296
Xcode handles this for you.


103
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,196
And if you're experienced,


104
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:51,366
you might be wondering
why you need a new profile


105
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,246
when you add an entitlement
to your app.


106
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:57,186
It's because of that white list.


107
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,256
Speaking of entitlements,


108
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,766
entitlements declare
support for capabilities.


109
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:06,826
And fundamentally an
entitlement is just a string


110
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,826
with an associated value.


111
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,206
Like a string or a bowl.


112
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,736
And these are defined
per target.


113
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:16,886
So if your app uses one
set of capabilities,


114
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:20,416
and your app extension uses
another set, that's fine.


115
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:25,966
And Xcode has a dedicated editor
for working with capabilities,


116
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,716
called the Capabilities tab.


117
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:32,366
And the Capabilities tab will
manage your entitlements PLIST


118
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,186
in the configuration details.


119
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,976
So you don't have to visit
the developer website.


120
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:39,336
You can do it all
from within Xcode.


121
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:44,576
So those are the things you
need in order to sign your apps.


122
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:48,066
Now what happens when Xcode
goes to sign your app?


123
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,326
It needs to know which
certificate to use,


124
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,586
and which provision and profile.


125
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:55,616
The way that works is,
Xcode will build your app.


126
00:06:56,276 --> 00:07:00,066
And then it looks at the list
of certificates on your machine.


127
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:04,286
And it picks the newest one that
matches your development team.


128
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:07,866
Xcode then looks at
the list of profiles.


129
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:11,326
And it picks the newest one
that matches your bundle ID.


130
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:14,056
And these two things
are brought together.


131
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:16,776
The profile is embedded
in the app.


132
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:19,856
And the certificate
is used with Code Sign


133
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,206
to apply the code seal.


134
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:25,266
So that's a quick
run through of some


135
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,286
of the fundamentals
of signing your apps.


136
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:32,866
Let's talk now about the
changes we've made for setting


137
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,166
up new machines with
signing certificates.


138
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,926
So who's seen this before?


139
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:42,956
Yeah. Your account
already has a certificate,


140
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,016
and Xcode offers to reset it.


141
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:49,096
So what happens when
you click that button?


142
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:50,816
Yeah, so what happens
is it gets rid


143
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,706
of your current cert
and makes a new one.


144
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:54,636
And why is this?


145
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,616
Well, your development
account has a limit


146
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:59,436
of one signing certificate.


147
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,646
And if you have a single
machine, this works great.


148
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:05,156
The cert is created.


149
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:08,356
You have a private key that's
generated, and it stays


150
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:10,296
in your keychain
and it just works.


151
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:14,556
Now what happens if
you have a second Mac?


152
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:17,926
Well, to build and sign
on that second Mac,


153
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,896
you need a signing
cert and a private key.


154
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:26,206
And you can either sync that
over using keychain access


155
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,386
or Xcode and import the
private key on the second Mac.


156
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,796
Or you can create a new
signing certificate.


157
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,905
But that first requires
getting rid of the old one.


158
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:39,816
And now you can build on the
second Mac, but you can't build


159
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,035
on your first Mac anymore.


160
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:44,836
And it's easy to repeat this
process, and go back and forth


161
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:47,946
between being able to build on
one machine, and not being able


162
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,116
to build on another one.


163
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:51,956
And this is really
frustrating and cumbersome.


164
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,536
Well, the good news
is in Xcode 8,


165
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,636
you can now have multiple
development certificates.


166
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:00,146
So -- yeah [applause].


167
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:07,206
Each of your machines can have
their own dedicated certificate


168
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:08,396
and private key.


169
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,566
So you never have to sync
private keys for development,


170
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,966
and you don't have
to see this again.


171
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:20,026
These changes apply just for
development certificates.


172
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,336
Your distribution certs
still have a limit of one


173
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,436
that you need to manage.


174
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:30,286
These are created both through
Xcode or the developer websites.


175
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:34,476
And these are created
in Xcode 8 and later.


176
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:39,526
And if you have an old copy
of Xcode on your machine,


177
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:43,156
and you create one of these new
signing certificates, it works.


178
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,466
They're 100% backwards
compatible.


179
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:50,436
So that's what we've changed


180
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,226
about signing certificates
in Xcode 8.


181
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,966
I'd like to turn the stage
over to my colleague, Itai,


182
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:59,136
who's going to tell you
about the new workflows


183
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:02,296
in Xcode 8 [applause].


184
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,286
>> Good morning everyone.


185
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:09,436
So Joshua's walked us
through the fundamental pieces


186
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,306
that are involved in
signing your applications.


187
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:15,806
You need a signing certificate
and a provisioning profile


188
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:18,516
that matches your device
and your app's entitlements.


189
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:21,656
But many of you also
have app extensions.


190
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:22,686
Watch apps.


191
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,266
Or embedded frameworks
in your app.


192
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,586
And each of those brings its
own signing requirements.


193
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,216
All this can add up to
a complicated picture,


194
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,226
where signing becomes
a bit of a puzzle.


195
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:37,406
And fitting all the pieces
together can be pretty


196
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,326
difficult sometimes.


197
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,986
So Xcode for many releases
has provided assistance


198
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:43,996
to help make this easier.


199
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:49,416
In Xcode 7, the Fix Issue button
would appear whenever Xcode


200
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,536
detected that something was
wrong with your signing setup.


201
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:57,166
Now sometimes clicking on Fix
Issue would fix the problem,


202
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,056
and you can return to
developing your app.


203
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:01,776
But a lot of the times it
wouldn't fix the problem.


204
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:04,146
Or you had to click
it multiple times.


205
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:08,466
And in all cases, Xcode
wasn't very communicative


206
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,866
about what the issue was.


207
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,066
What it did when you
clicked Fix Issue, and why.


208
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:16,046
And really, if Xcode knew
how to solve the problem,


209
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,586
why did it need to interrupt
your development workflow


210
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:21,076
and make you click a button?


211
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:24,196
Interacting with signing
in Xcode 7 often felt


212
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:25,966
like you were talking
to a black box.


213
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,926
You couldn't see inside, but you
could mash the red panic button


214
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:29,956
whenever you got frustrated.


215
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:32,606
So that didn't work
out very well.


216
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,796
And in Xcode 8 we've gotten
rid of the Fix Issue button.


217
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,286
But we've also done a lot more.


218
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,896
[ Applause ]


219
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:46,006
We fully redesigned how
signing works in Xcode 8.


220
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,856
There's a brand new
signing infrastructure


221
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,876
which is much faster and
more reliable than before.


222
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,346
On top of that, we
built new workflows,


223
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:58,056
and a new user interface
in the General tab.


224
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:01,736
So you can see and manage
your signing settings all


225
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:02,576
in one place.


226
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:06,696
Then we took a look at
how Xcode communicates


227
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:08,196
with you about signing issues.


228
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,316
A lot of the error messages
were not very actionable


229
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,066
or communicative.


230
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,366
And so we've revised
them all in Xcode8.


231
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,446
So that you see much
more helpful


232
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,846
and actionable information
when something goes wrong.


233
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,146
And for those of you
who are very curious


234
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:24,996
about what Xcode
does on your behalf


235
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,016
when it fixes a signing problem.


236
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:28,866
We've added new status
reporting.


237
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:31,886
So you can always see exactly
what Xcode did and why.


238
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:36,426
So as Joshua mentioned
at the beginning,


239
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:40,356
there are two new ways of
working with signing in Xcode 8.


240
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,176
The first one is
automatic signing.


241
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,396
Now automatic signing has
been fully redesigned,


242
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:50,316
and it takes care of all of
your signing needs for you.


243
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:55,416
You'll never need to create a
profile, or update your app ID.


244
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,496
And Xcode will do it
all in the background.


245
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:59,536
So while you're developing
your application,


246
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:01,816
Xcode will keep your
signing up to date.


247
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,726
For those of you who
want full control


248
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,336
over how your application
is signed,


249
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,506
you can enable customized
signing.


250
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:15,046
In this mode, Xcode will
never create or modify one


251
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,526
of your provisioning profiles.


252
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:18,736
And it will never change
your signing settings.


253
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:21,606
So let's take a look
at how these work


254
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:22,576
in a little bit more detail.


255
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:24,276
Starting with automatic signing.


256
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,826
When you create a new project,


257
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:30,316
automatic signing
will be on by default.


258
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,856
But if you're an
experienced developer,


259
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:36,196
or you're opening an existing
project, you can enable it


260
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:38,646
in the General tab in
this new signing UI.


261
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,236
All you have to do
is check the box.


262
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:46,006
And then tell Xcode
your development team.


263
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:50,346
From that point on, Xcode will
take care of creating profiles


264
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,096
and signing certificates
for you.


265
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,806
And it will even show you
the profile and certificate


266
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:57,626
that will be used when
you build your app.


267
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:01,256
So what sorts of things will
automatic signing do for you?


268
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:04,686
Well, it will create your
signing certificates.


269
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,766
So if you're developing
an iOS app,


270
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,696
it'll create an iOS
development certificate for you.


271
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:14,206
It will also create and update
your app ID's and profiles.


272
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:15,256
And it does this


273
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,926
in the background while you're
working on your application.


274
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:19,976
So you can stay focused
on developments.


275
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:24,286
But there are still
some instances


276
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,806
where Xcode 8 will prompt you.


277
00:14:26,286 --> 00:14:29,186
In particular, when you connect
a new device to your Mac.


278
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:31,826
One that's not already
registered


279
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:32,876
on your development team.


280
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:35,926
Xcode will ask you
before it registers it.


281
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,816
Because we know device limits
are finite, and you want


282
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,896
to have full control over
how those are allocated.


283
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:46,166
And finally, if you're
curious about what Xcode does


284
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,676
on your behalf in
the background,


285
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,336
you can view the signing report


286
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:51,946
to see exactly what
Xcode did, and why.


287
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,786
So let me show you how this
all works on the demo machine.


288
00:14:56,036 --> 00:15:00,746
So I'm going to show you
automatic signing on Xcode 8,


289
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,466
using a brand new iOS app.


290
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,536
I'll hit Next.


291
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,216
And I'll give this a name.


292
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:12,756
I'm not a great cook,
so I like easy recipes.


293
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:16,586
Now the first thing I'd
like to call your attention


294
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:20,766
to in the new project assistant
is the new popup labeled "Team".


295
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:23,126
When you create your project,


296
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:26,176
you can immediately choose the
development team that you'd


297
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,286
like to use for signing.


298
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:28,966
And from that point on,


299
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:31,106
your project will
already be configured


300
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,496
for automatic signing
with the right team.


301
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:36,846
So I'll just hit Next.


302
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:41,196
And I'll create this
on my desktop.


303
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:44,306
So what did Xcode just do?


304
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,296
It created a brand new project,


305
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,916
and automatic signing
is turned on by default.


306
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:51,466
When I created the project,


307
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,156
it immediately generated
the signing certificate


308
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:56,156
and a provisioning
profile for me.


309
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,746
I can zoom in on here
so it's easier to see.


310
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,786
If I'd like to change
my development team,


311
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,556
I can also do that there.


312
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:14,406
So that's how easy it is to
set up a brand new project.


313
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:17,316
I can immediately build
and run on a device.


314
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,106
I never had to click "Fix Issue"


315
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,396
or configure any
profiles myself.


316
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:24,856
All I did was create a new
project, and tell Xcode my team.


317
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,506
But let's make this a
little more interesting.


318
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:32,636
As Joshua mentioned earlier,
you can use the Capabilities tab


319
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,066
to enable platform
features that you'd


320
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,586
like to use, like Cloud Kit.


321
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:38,846
So let's do that in
this application.


322
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:42,396
We'll go to the Capabilities
tab.


323
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,166
And here I see all
the capabilities


324
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,556
that my app can support.


325
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:50,156
And all I have to do is flip
this switch to turn one on.


326
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:55,826
I'd like to use Cloud Kit
here, and Push Notifications.


327
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:01,456
So when I did that, Xcode made
a few changes to my project.


328
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:02,846
It linked frameworks.


329
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,516
It modified my Entitlement's
file.


330
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:07,616
But it also communicated
with the developer portal


331
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,406
to download a new profile.


332
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,536
And now I can build
and run my app.


333
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:15,435
And I can immediately
start using these features.


334
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,695
Again, I never had to
click a Fix Issue button,


335
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,856
or type in any entitlements
myself.


336
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:23,715
Now, I happen to know that
Xcode downloaded a new profile,


337
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,066
because I'm an Xcode engineer.


338
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:27,236
But most of you probably aren't.


339
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:31,656
So if you're curious about what
Xcode did, you can always click


340
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:33,176
over to the Reports Navigator.


341
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:36,916
Where you'll see a brand new
report called Update Signing.


342
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,506
Whenever Xcode resolves a
signing problem for you,


343
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,796
one of these reports
will be created.


344
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,036
Let's take a look at
the most recent one


345
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:48,096
to see what it contains.


346
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,956
And I'll zoom in to
make that easier to see.


347
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:56,246
So here we can see Xcode
diagnosed a problem.


348
00:17:56,886 --> 00:18:00,286
And I can see more information
about that problem by selecting


349
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:01,736
that row and expanding it.


350
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:06,226
So Xcode's telling me my
existing profile doesn't


351
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:07,066
support iCloud.


352
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,936
And immediately below that,


353
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,656
I can see that it created
a new profile for my app.


354
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:17,106
So that's how easy it is to
see exactly what Xcode does


355
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:19,216
on my behalf whenever
it fixes a problem.


356
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:29,546
[ Applause ]


357
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:31,446
Now there are a few more
things you should know


358
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:32,636
about automatic signing.


359
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:36,396
The first one is that it
does development signing.


360
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,546
Distribution is handled
through a different workflow;


361
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:41,696
which Joshua will describe
a little bit later.


362
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:46,396
And it's limited to Xcode
created provisioning profile.


363
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:49,846
These of course are profiles
Xcode makes on your behalf,


364
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,456
and it keeps them up-to-date


365
00:18:51,636 --> 00:18:53,316
as you're working
on your application.


366
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:58,876
And as a result of these,
you can use automatic signing


367
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,406
without ever having to worry


368
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,246
about your distribution signing
assets being touched by Xcode.


369
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,616
So your distribution certificate


370
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:09,036
and provisioning profile
will never be modified


371
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,096
by automatic signing.


372
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:14,436
So automatic signing.


373
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,736
It's been completely
redesigned in Xcode 8.


374
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,886
It stays out of your way,
and it manages signing.


375
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,266
So you can focus on
what's really important,


376
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,376
which is developing your app.


377
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,296
Now let's take a look at
the other side of the fence.


378
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,486
Customized signing.


379
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:34,536
As you'll recall, this is a
mode where you have full control


380
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:35,816
over how your app is signed.


381
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:40,706
You can enable customized
signing


382
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,726
by unchecking the checkbox
in the General tab.


383
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,426
And once you've done that,


384
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:49,516
Xcode will let you choose
different provisioning profiles


385
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,286
for each of your
build configurations.


386
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:55,576
This is really handy if you have
a continuous integration system.


387
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:57,896
Or you need different
profiles for free


388
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,076
and paid versions of your app.


389
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:00,876
Now you have the
power to do that.


390
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,086
And you can configure this
all within the General tab.


391
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,626
You don't have to visit the
Build Settings Editor anymore.


392
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:10,946
So this is a really
powerful new UI


393
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:12,856
for configuring your
signing settings.


394
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,276
But we wanted to take
this one step further.


395
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:19,096
Those of you who have manually
chosen profiles in the past,


396
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:22,476
have probably run into
some weird installation


397
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:25,366
or runtime issues usually
having to do with entitlements.


398
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:28,956
And we wanted Xcode to give
you more helpful information


399
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:31,466
about that before you
run into those issues.


400
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:35,086
So we've added new
error reporting right


401
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:36,176
within the General tab.


402
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,956
And you can see this right
alongside your settings.


403
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,216
So it's easier to
choose the right profile.


404
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:46,166
Here I can see that my profile
doesn't support the capabilities


405
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,256
that my app is using.


406
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:49,646
So I know exactly what
I need to do in order


407
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:50,646
to resolve the problem.


408
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:58,566
In addition, I can
see more information


409
00:20:58,566 --> 00:20:59,956
about my provisioning profile


410
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:02,146
by clicking the profile
info button.


411
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,736
And here I can see
a lot of details.


412
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,556
Like when my profile
was created.


413
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,676
Which capabilities it supports.


414
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,536
And again, it's easy to
tell when there's a problem,


415
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:15,286
exactly what I need
to do to resolve it.


416
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:20,366
Now customized signing
is limited


417
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,156
to manually created profiles.


418
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,826
These are profiles
that you or someone


419
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,966
on your team has created
using the developer website.


420
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,456
And Xcode will never
modify these.


421
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:34,176
And you can choose
any type of profile.


422
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:37,236
So as I mentioned, if you want
to use development profiles


423
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:40,376
for some build configurations,
and distribution profiles


424
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:45,766
for others, you're
free to do that.


425
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:47,236
Now this is a really cool thing.


426
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:49,956
Especially for those of
you experienced developers


427
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:52,126
who have manually chosen
profiles in the past.


428
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:53,876
There's a new build setting


429
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:56,736
in Xcode 8 called
Provisioning Profile Specifier.


430
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,196
And what this does is it
references your profiles


431
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:00,836
by name.


432
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:05,816
Now the reason this is a
big deal is because prior


433
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:08,516
to Xcode 8, Xcode would
reference your profiles


434
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:10,296
by their unique ID.


435
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,426
Whenever a new developer
joined your team,


436
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:13,696
or you added a new device,


437
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,736
you'd need to generate a
new version of your profile.


438
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,246
And when you did that,
you'd get a new unique ID.


439
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:21,466
So then you'd need to
update your project.


440
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:26,376
Well, now in Xcode 8, since
we reference profiles by name,


441
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:29,216
all you need to do is
generate a new profile,


442
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:31,586
and Xcode will automatically
pick it up.


443
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:36,326
You don't need to update your
project [applause] thank you.


444
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:40,396
[ Applause ]


445
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,516
So let's take a look


446
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:43,806
at how customized signing
works on the demo machine.


447
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:54,356
Okay. I'm going to show you
another app I've been working


448
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,596
on called, Scrapbook.


449
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,186
And let me zoom in on that.


450
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,936
So Scrapbook is set up
for customized signing.


451
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:06,166
I've chosen different
profiles for the free


452
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,506
and paid versions of my app.


453
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:10,226
And it's really easy
to configure


454
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:11,636
that in the General tab.


455
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:13,226
This is all I had to do.


456
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,846
Just select different
profiles from those pop ups.


457
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,716
And since I don't see
any error messages here,


458
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,856
I already know I can
build and run on a device,


459
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,886
and everything will work.


460
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,536
But as in the earlier demo,


461
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,456
let's make this a
little more interesting.


462
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:32,106
I'd like to use the Capabilities
tab so I can use iCloud


463
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,186
and Push Notifications
in this app as well.


464
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:38,006
Now if you've used the
Capabilities tab in the past


465
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:40,976
with a manually specified
provisioning profile,


466
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:43,966
you might've noticed that it
sometimes would change your


467
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:44,816
signing settings.


468
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:46,676
Or make changes that
you didn't really want.


469
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:51,406
In Xcode 8, the Capabilities
tab is now safe to use


470
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:52,696
in customized signing mode.


471
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:56,386
It'll make the local changes
that are safe to make,


472
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:58,816
such as updating your
entitlements PLIST.


473
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,096
But it won't touch
your profiles.


474
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:04,426
It'll just tell you what steps
you need to take manually


475
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:06,066
in order to resolve
those problems.


476
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,626
So let's take a look at that.


477
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:16,256
I'll click on Capabilities,
and then turn on iCloud


478
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,096
and Push Notifications.


479
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:25,216
Now Xcode is showing me
checkmarks next to the steps


480
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,356
that it was able to complete.


481
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:29,756
And little error icons next
to the steps that I still need


482
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:31,496
to complete on the
developer website.


483
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:36,056
I can see more information
about this in the General tab.


484
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,626
I'll zoom in on that.


485
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:44,306
And if you look at
that error message,


486
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:47,206
you can see Xcode's telling
me my selected profile doesn't


487
00:24:47,206 --> 00:24:49,076
support iCloud and
Push Notifications.


488
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:51,806
That's kind of obvious
since I just enabled those.


489
00:24:52,436 --> 00:24:53,666
But it's really clear.


490
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,196
I can tell exactly what I need
to do to fix this problem.


491
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,776
Whereas in the past, if I
had tried to build and run,


492
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:01,886
my app either wouldn't install
or wouldn't run correctly.


493
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:06,046
And finally, if I want
to see more information,


494
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:08,096
I can click the Profile
Info button.


495
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:12,626
And Xcode will show me more
detail about my profile.


496
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:15,676
Like the capabilities that it
supports and those it doesn't.


497
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,876
So again, it's easy to
see exactly what I need


498
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:20,056
to do to fix a problem.


499
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,146
So let's go fix this one.


500
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:26,296
As I mentioned earlier, in
customized signing mode,


501
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:28,676
Xcode won't modify
profiles for me.


502
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:31,776
I need to visit the developer
website to do it myself.


503
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,336
So I'll open up the
developer website and click


504
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,456
on Certificates,
Identifiers, and Profiles.


505
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:42,426
The first thing I need to
do is update my app ID.


506
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:44,766
So I'll select App IDs.


507
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:48,536
And I'll choose the app ID I've
already created for this app.


508
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:52,246
This shows me all the
capabilities that are available.


509
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:53,666
I'll hit, Edit.


510
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:57,026
Scroll down and turn on iCloud.


511
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:01,576
Now this alert message that
I'm seeing is reminding me


512
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:03,296
that after I update my app ID,


513
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:05,236
I also need to download
a new version


514
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:06,556
of my provisioning profile.


515
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,006
So I'll just hit, Okay.


516
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:13,586
And then I'd like to enable
the newer version of iCloud.


517
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:14,806
So I'll turn that on.


518
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:17,596
And again I'm reminded
that I need a new profile.


519
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:21,616
So I'll click, Okay.


520
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:24,136
Scroll down and turn
on Push Notifications.


521
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:25,906
And now I'm done.


522
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,466
The next step is
updating my profile.


523
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:31,196
So I'm going to click
on Development.


524
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,286
And you'll see the two scrapbook
profiles are now marked


525
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:35,906
as invalid.


526
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:38,456
That's because I've made
changes to my app ID.


527
00:26:38,756 --> 00:26:40,896
But I haven't regenerated
the profiles yet.


528
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,386
So they're out of date.


529
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:45,496
Let's update the
Scrapbook Free profile.


530
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:48,976
I'll select it and click, Edit.


531
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:51,306
And I can scroll down
through all of this.


532
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:54,656
I'm not making changes
to certs or to devices.


533
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:56,726
And I'll click on Generate.


534
00:26:57,336 --> 00:26:59,196
And then download
the new profile.


535
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:03,226
Now the very last step is I
need to install this profile


536
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:04,846
so that Xcode can use it.


537
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:08,176
I can do that just by clicking
it in the Downloads folder.


538
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:11,336
So what just happened there?


539
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:12,936
I'll zoom in on that.


540
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:16,866
When I clicked on the
profile, Xcode installed it,


541
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:20,386
and immediately updated
to start using it.


542
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,366
So we can see the errors in
the free build configuration


543
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,936
of my app have disappeared.


544
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:28,596
You might also have noticed


545
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:30,816
that I didn't make any
project changes here.


546
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:34,056
This is provisioning profile
specifier working behind


547
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:34,526
the scenes.


548
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:37,226
Once I installed the new
version of the profile,


549
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:40,056
Xcode just started
using it automatically.


550
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,296
Now I can build and run
the free version of my app,


551
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:44,836
and everything will work.


552
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,176
I can use iCloud and Push.


553
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:48,776
But it looks like I still need


554
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:50,486
to update the premium
version of my app.


555
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:53,446
Does everybody want to see me do
that on the developer website?


556
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:54,606
Or we get the idea?


557
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:57,896
Okay. It's a little bit tedious.


558
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,216
If you were paying
attention to the earlier demo,


559
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:03,026
you might have noticed
this is actually --


560
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,876
all those steps I just performed
are the exact same steps


561
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:08,686
that Xcode performed for
me in automatic signing.


562
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:11,996
So that's customized signing.


563
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:15,426
A brand new mode in Xcode 8,
where you have full control


564
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:16,696
over how your app is signed.


565
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:19,416
Xcode won't interfere
with your settings,


566
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,206
or modify your profiles.


567
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:24,336
But I'd like to encourage
you all to try


568
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,546
out automatic signing.


569
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:28,666
It's been completely
redesigned in Xcode 8,


570
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,066
and it's provides a really
seamless development workflow


571
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,346
that I think you'll
really enjoy.


572
00:28:32,936 --> 00:28:35,626
Now I'd like to invite
Joshua back


573
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,606
up to show you some best
practices [applause].


574
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:40,556
>> Thanks Itai [applause].


575
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:47,776
So we just saw the new
workflows in Xcode 8


576
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:50,826
that makes it really easy
and fast to manage signing.


577
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,486
Now I'd like to talk
about some best practices


578
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:56,806
for managing signing
in your projects.


579
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:00,836
The first thing is,
use automatic.


580
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:04,756
Automatic is designed to make
your life as easy as possible.


581
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:07,436
And it works great


582
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:10,756
with individual developers,
or large teams.


583
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,526
So you should add all of the
developers that work on your app


584
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,766
to your development team.


585
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:21,246
You should use the Capabilities
tab to manage entitlements.


586
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,716
So you can avoid visiting
the developer website


587
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:26,426
to configure things
like iCloud containers.


588
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:33,296
If you use customized signing,
don't set code sign identity.


589
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:36,036
You have a specific
signing certificate


590
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:37,756
that is linked to your account.


591
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:41,266
So if you set this to your
particular signing cert


592
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:43,186
and someone else
pulls your project,


593
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:44,946
they won't be able to build.


594
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:47,516
So you should leave that
with the default value.


595
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,616
Instead of visiting the
Build Settings Editor,


596
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,116
you should use the new UI


597
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,456
in the General tab
of the Target Editor.


598
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:59,936
This allows you to see more
information about the profile.


599
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:04,736
And it also correctly sets
the profile specifier by name,


600
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:07,096
so you can avoid churn
in your projects.


601
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:11,306
You should also use
the Capabilities tab


602
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:14,566
in Customized Signing Mode to
manage your entitlements PLIST.


603
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:19,526
And if you use development
signing for all


604
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,276
of your project's configuration,
you should try out automatic.


605
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:26,606
When you get back to your
Mac, go check that checkbox


606
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:30,966
in the target editor
and try it out.


607
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:34,436
When it comes to
distributing your app,


608
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:37,306
Xcode has a dedicated
workflow for this.


609
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:40,576
And it's based around
building an archive.


610
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:44,396
Archives contain a
copy of your app.


611
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:47,306
And it's important to note


612
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,306
that you should use
development signing.


613
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,426
If you sign your app with
a distribution certificate,


614
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:56,296
you won't be able to
test the exact bits


615
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,666
that you were trying to develop.


616
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:00,746
So this should be
development signed.


617
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,636
And when it comes time
to distribute that,


618
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,276
when you use the organizer,


619
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:09,696
Xcode will resign the app using
your development certificate


620
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,466
and provisioning profiles.


621
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:14,656
And if you clicked
Upload it will go straight


622
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:15,436
to iTunes connect.


623
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:20,406
Or if you clicked Export,
you'll get an IPA file or an app


624
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:22,316
that has been distribution
signed.


625
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:28,866
So that's the best practice
for distributing your content.


626
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,746
We've covered a few
things today.


627
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:33,966
We've talked about the new
changes to signing certificates


628
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,216
that makes it really easy
to set up new machines.


629
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:40,326
We've talked about the
new automatic workflow,


630
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:43,896
which takes a lot of the pain
out of developing your apps.


631
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:47,636
And we talked about the new
customized signing mode.


632
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:51,016
So you can configure your
projects as you see fit.


633
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,356
If that's what you desire.

And with that, thank you.
