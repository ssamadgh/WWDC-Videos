00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:18,500
[ Music ]


2
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:28,046
>> I guess I'm on.


3
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,456
[ Applause ]


4
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:32,506
Thank you.


5
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:37,576
We're going to be moving the
attendee bash to my house


6
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:40,936
over in Berkley, it's a
lot more fun over there.


7
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:47,776
So welcome to Session
717, Beyond Dictation,


8
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:51,706
Enhanced Voice-Control for
macOS and Applications.


9
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,506
I'm Sal Saghoian, I'm
the Product Manager


10
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,996
for Automation Technologies
at Apple.


11
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:01,386
Today we're going to be
talking about the Mac,


12
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:09,176
macOS and what happens when you
combine the speech recognition


13
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:15,806
architecture in the macOS with
the native automation frameworks


14
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:17,246
that are available to you


15
00:01:17,556 --> 00:01:20,316
to produce some really
incredible results.


16
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:23,986
Now when you're talking
about speech recognition


17
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:28,066
and dictation it's grouped
into four different categories.


18
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:33,296
The first dictation is
basically about transcription,


19
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:37,096
about you speaking something
that getting transcribed and put


20
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,816
into the current text field.


21
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:47,246
Enhanced dictation advances that
ability by adding the ability


22
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:51,406
to edit the text and to
navigate within a text field.


23
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:56,596
Advanced commands
include the ability


24
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,516
to control an application's
interface,


25
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:02,736
as well as perform
dictation tasks as well.


26
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,716
You can click buttons, tabs,
menus, those kinds of things.


27
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:11,986
And finally, user commands are
custom dictation commands you


28
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,836
create yourself to
perform the kind of things


29
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:18,136
that aren't a part of the
standard library of commands


30
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,556
that come with the computer.


31
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:24,286
So in macOS in the
latest version a lot


32
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,726
of things got moved
around, so what I'm going


33
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:30,616
to do is take a very short
couple minutes and review


34
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:34,086
where all these different
technologies live,


35
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,006
how to turn them on
and then we're going


36
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:37,976
to have some real fun.


37
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:43,416
So begin with we'll take
a look at basic dictation.


38
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:50,306
Now if you open up the System
Preferences app the controls


39
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:53,836
for speech and dictation
used to be in this window,


40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,636
but instead of where they
were there is now the


41
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,696
Siri preference.


42
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:02,146
And if we open the Siri
preference you'll see


43
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:05,286
that there are no controls in
there for dictation and speech.


44
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:10,196
It's important to understand
that Siri and dictation


45
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:13,106
and speech are two
different technologies.


46
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:16,146
They have different
functions, different uses,


47
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,466
and different purposes.


48
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:20,306
So if we close this
and we go back


49
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:24,156
out to the main preference
window and we search


50
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:26,306
for the word dictation
in the search field


51
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,786
at the top right you'll see


52
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:33,006
that interestingly the keyboard
preference is now selected.


53
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:39,566
And if we open that you'll see a
new button added to the Tab bar


54
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:42,476
of that window at the end
and it's for dictation.


55
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:46,766
If we select that there are
the dictation controls now


56
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:50,826
in macOS are now within the
Keyboard System Preference pane.


57
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:54,136
There's a couple of radio
buttons there initially


58
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:55,606
for turning it off and on.


59
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:58,956
And when you turn on
dictation, basic dictation,


60
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:02,786
you'll see this sheet drop
down and it has two bits


61
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,976
of information that are
important to understand.


62
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:13,206
The first is that what you say
gets recorded by the computer


63
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:16,505
and sent to Apple servers
so that it's transcribed


64
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,166
and that text is then sent
back to your computer.


65
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:26,366
In addition, for accuracy they
send up the names and addresses


66
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:31,526
from your contacts list so
that they can better match some


67
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,016
of the phrases that
you're saying.


68
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:35,976
If those terms are
okay with you,


69
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,656
then you just click the
Enable Dictation button


70
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:41,566
and now dictation is on.


71
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:45,196
And you can dictate
into any text field


72
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:50,056
like a TextEdit document,
into a messages window,


73
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:54,626
into a mail message, and even


74
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:58,356
into a URL input
field for Safari.


75
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:02,056
You can use dictation
anywhere on the computer


76
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,366
where you have a text field.


77
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:07,566
And it's good for doing short
things, names, addresses,


78
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:10,106
some short phrases, it's
really good for that.


79
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,326
But it does have
some limitations


80
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:15,206
in that you do need an
active Internet connection


81
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:16,686
to connect to the servers.


82
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:21,606
And it's also not intended
for use with long dictations


83
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:26,056
like if you're doing a business
letter, it's not really designed


84
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:27,736
for that kind of thing.


85
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,916
You'll have to keep activating
the dictation command all the


86
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,206
time and there really are no
editing controls for dealing


87
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:35,796
with mistakes or
changes you want


88
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:37,486
to make to the dictated text.


89
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:41,626
Which brings us to
the next category,


90
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:43,416
which is enhanced dictation.


91
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:46,346
Not only can you
dictate into text fields,


92
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,946
but you could navigate between
the different text fields


93
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:52,926
of a window and edit the text
that you have there as well.


94
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,216
That was a pretty nice
little animation there,


95
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:55,816
did you like that?


96
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:59,256
So if we go back to our
Preferences window here,


97
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:02,416
below the On Off button
that we just turned off


98
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,186
and on is a checkbox called
Use Enhanced Dictation.


99
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:09,696
And when you select this
three things happen.


100
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:14,476
The first is it allows your
computer to be used offline.


101
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:18,676
You no longer have to --
require an Internet connection


102
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:19,916
to Apple servers.


103
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:24,876
All the transcription is done
locally on your computer.


104
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:28,676
In addition, you can
dictate continuously.


105
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:31,176
So you can sit there
over a 20 minute period


106
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:34,996
to dictate a letter and work
continuously with the computer


107
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:37,356
so that it will actually
grab what you say


108
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,596
and type it in for you.


109
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,796
And the third thing is that
the computer can now give you


110
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,016
live feedback.


111
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:48,276
It can give you an audio
sound or a visual cue


112
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:51,036
that it has heard you, that it
has recognized what you have


113
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:51,546
to say.


114
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:57,526
So we're going to turn
that on and then go back


115
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,296
out to the main Preferences
window.


116
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:04,416
Now to see what kind of commands
are available to us we're going


117
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,456
to go to the Accessibility
System Preference pane


118
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:10,596
and scroll down that
list on the left


119
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,636
and select the thing
that says Dictation.


120
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,616
Your preferences for using
dictation on the computer


121
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:20,866
in an enhanced mode are now
displayed here on the right.


122
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:24,936
You have an option to mute the
audio when you're dictating.


123
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:26,266
So if you have iTunes playing


124
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,946
and you started dictation
it automatically mutes it.


125
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:32,726
You can have it play
a confirmation sound,


126
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:35,206
which is usually like a
little [swish sound] just


127
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,486
to let you know that
it heard you.


128
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:41,406
You'll hear this being used when
I do some demos here for you.


129
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,886
And you can also
assign a key word


130
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:47,876
so that the computer will
not react to what you say


131
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,736
until it hears that
key word first


132
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,576
like computer what time is it.


133
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:57,296
So to see the commands that
you've now enabled we're going


134
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:01,066
to click the Dictation Commands
button and we get this sheet


135
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,476
that comes down and it
lists all the commands.


136
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,626
Commands are grouped into suites


137
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,726
and suites contain
one or more commands.


138
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:14,266
You can search through all the
available commands using the


139
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:16,156
search field at the top.


140
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,816
And when you have a command
selected you can turn it off


141
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:22,956
or on by selecting that
checkbox to the left of it.


142
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:28,076
And you can also see the
syntactical options available


143
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:30,306
to you on the right-hand side.


144
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:34,416
A lot of commands can be spoken
a variety of different ways


145
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,006
and all of those different
ways will trigger the command


146
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:37,765
to execute.


147
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:40,986
So let's look at the first suite


148
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,586
of commands, the
Selection Suite.


149
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,606
This suite is designed
to select text.


150
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:49,146
So you can select a word,
a paragraph, a sentence


151
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,416
and you'll notice that
there is even a command


152
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,796
for selecting a phrase.


153
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:57,486
The Navigation Suite
is for navigating


154
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,836
within your editing area.


155
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:03,136
So you can go to the end, go
to the beginning, go to the end


156
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:04,646
of the sentence that
kind of thing.


157
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:08,236
You can scroll up, scroll
down, move left, move right.


158
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:12,026
So it's really designed to
help you move around a window


159
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:16,456
between different fields and
scrolling the view plane.


160
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,916
There is a short editing suite
that contains the ability


161
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:24,326
to cut, copy, paste, as well
as perform some transformations


162
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:27,436
like capitalize,
lowercase, uppercase,


163
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,596
those kinds of things.


164
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:32,646
And you'll notice that there
is one special command there


165
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:33,876
called Replace.


166
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:36,796
So you can say replace
this phrase


167
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,476
with this phrase,
that's quite handy.


168
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,796
There's a small formatting suite
for doing things like bold,


169
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,976
italicized underline and
there is a small system suite


170
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:52,936
for stopping dictation and for
also displaying a floating HUD


171
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:55,246
that lists all of the commands.


172
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:57,606
So if you're in the
middle of a dictation


173
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,646
and you're not sure what
command is available,


174
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:02,976
you can say show Commands and
this little HUD will appear.


175
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:07,586
So together these make a
pretty comprehensive set


176
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:10,846
for doing some basic
good editing


177
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:12,126
of what you're dictating.


178
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,336
And to show you I
recorded a little video


179
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:17,226
of me doing it in pages.


180
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:21,296
So I just said something
it gets transcribed.


181
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,656
Replace Brazil with America.


182
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:41,236
Select power, capitalize that,
go to end, new line, new line,


183
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:48,056
the future of wind
power is amazing period.


184
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:53,676
So I dictated to the computer,
it transcribed what I said.


185
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:57,906
I said select -- wait
until you see me live.


186
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:02,366
So then I used the Replace
command, I selected Brazil,


187
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,526
changed it to America,


188
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:06,366
I capitalized something,
I navigated around.


189
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:10,096
So you get the idea that, you
know, this is very powerful.


190
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,516
Enhanced dictation
gives you many things.


191
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:17,116
It allows you to work
continuously offline


192
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:21,276
on your computer with no
interaction necessary.


193
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:23,126
It's giving you live feedback,


194
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,016
but it does have
some limitations


195
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,256
and I call it it's procedural.


196
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:31,136
It means that it's
like describing how


197
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:33,026
to make a peanut
butter sandwich.


198
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:36,646
You hold the jar with this
hand, you turn the top this way.


199
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:39,146
So you have to guide
the computer


200
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,726
through the process
of what you're doing.


201
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:45,976
You have to tell it to move to
the end, new line, new line.


202
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:49,566
And that can take some
getting used to in order


203
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:50,986
to be able to do that smoothly.


204
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:57,756
The next category of recognition
is advanced commands and that's


205
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:01,076
where you augment the dictation
abilities with the ability


206
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:03,516
to control the application
interface.


207
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,556
So not only are you
being able to dictate,


208
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:08,986
but you can push buttons.


209
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,196
So if we go back to
this accessibility sheet


210
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:13,996
that we were looking at down


211
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:19,906
at the bottom is a checkbox
called Enable Advanced Commands.


212
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:26,466
And if you select that it turns
on new suites and expands some


213
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,526
of the suites of commands
that are available.


214
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:33,896
So the Navigation Suite now
expands to include things


215
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,566
for controlling the
application interface.


216
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:40,456
You can say show numbers
and a number will be placed


217
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,766
over every control
in the application


218
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,666
and then you can just speak
the number and that button


219
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:48,656
or menu will be pressed
and activated.


220
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:54,166
The System Suite is now
expanded to include the ability


221
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:58,716
to search spotlight and
that is really useful.


222
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:00,766
You can also show commands


223
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:03,106
and hide commands just
the same way as before.


224
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:07,686
There is now an Application
Suite for switching


225
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,976
between applications, for
quitting an application,


226
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,216
and hiding an application.


227
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:17,236
And there's a small Document
Suite that lets you open,


228
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:22,056
create, save, close documents
within an application.


229
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:27,236
So in addition to this existing
set of commands that we have,


230
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:32,236
the new set augments
that and expands some


231
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:33,396
of the key things there.


232
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,926
So let me show you how
that works when you use it.


233
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,786
And in this case
I'm going to use it


234
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,426
to create a document in Keynote.


235
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:46,376
So switch to Keynote and Keynote
will come forward, Show Commands


236
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:50,046
and you'll get that
floating HUD that has a list


237
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,766
of all the commands
that are available.


238
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,546
And if we look at the
document section there,


239
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,016
there's a command for new item.


240
00:13:56,456 --> 00:14:00,816
And this is same thing as going
Command End on the keyboard


241
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:03,576
or selecting New
from the File menu.


242
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:09,176
So I'll say New Item, it
recognizes and since we're


243
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:11,566
in Keynote it brings
up the Template Picker


244
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,256
so I can pick what kind of
presentation I want to make.


245
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:17,726
I'm looking to make
a wide presentation


246
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,486
and at the top is a
button that I would click


247
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,566
if I was doing this by hand


248
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:26,376
to see the wide presentation
templates.


249
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:30,006
So I'll click Wide and that
will press the button for me


250
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,456
and reveal all the
wide presentations.


251
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:34,836
Now I'm looking for parchment,


252
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:37,006
so it doesn't appear
in this view.


253
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:40,746
So I'll have it scroll the
window by saying Scroll Down


254
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,826
and then there's
parchment at the very end.


255
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:47,306
And I can select that by
saying Click Parchment.


256
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:53,166
And once I do it will open
up a new Keynote document


257
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:56,196
with the parchment theme.


258
00:14:57,256 --> 00:15:02,766
So you can see that advanced
commands augment dictation


259
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:06,216
by giving you control of
the application interface.


260
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,576
All the buttons and
tabs are available.


261
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:12,516
But again, like the
other categories


262
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:15,366
of speech recognition
there are some limitations


263
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,066
and it too is procedural.


264
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:19,446
You notice I had to
walk through each step


265
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:24,356
of doing the things required
to create a Keynote document.


266
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:28,276
I'm basically using my voice
as a mouse or a keyboard


267
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:34,656
and not all applications have
complete accessibility support.


268
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:36,616
Generally, they do
have good support,


269
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:38,516
but that could also be an issue.


270
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:41,016
You might not be able to
give a command for the thing


271
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:42,176
that you want it to do.


272
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:47,096
But here's the good
news user commands.


273
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,746
This is where we leave the
world of accessibility behind.


274
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:56,036
This is where the power of
automation and the power


275
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:58,576
of speech recognition
fuse together


276
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:01,076
to produce incredible tools.


277
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:04,546
So let me show you how you
access these on the computer.


278
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:09,836
So in this window is a
secret button for turning


279
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:15,036
on this power ability and it
is right here, this + button.


280
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:19,056
It doesn't look like much, it
looks like any other + button,


281
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:24,956
but when you press that + button
a new suite is added called User


282
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:29,196
Commands and by default a new
blank command is set up for you.


283
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:34,396
So now we can create our own
command and to do that I'm going


284
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:38,326
to describe some parameters on
the left-hand side beginning


285
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:41,686
with what is the phrase that
I want to use as a command.


286
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,046
So let's say I want to create
a command to tell the computer


287
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,856
to take my picture right.


288
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,886
So I enter take my
picture in there.


289
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:54,246
So when I say the words take my
picture the computer will do the


290
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,236
actions I want it to do.


291
00:16:56,826 --> 00:17:01,236
Now you can determine if this
command is always available


292
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:04,116
or only within a
specific application


293
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,646
by selecting it from
this pop-up.


294
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:08,195
I'm going to leave it
set for Any Application.


295
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:14,326
And to perform the action you
have a menu of possible things


296
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:19,026
that the computer will do for
you upon dictating that command.


297
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:22,776
You can have the computer
open up certain finder items


298
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,996
like certain documents
that you want opened.


299
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:28,766
You can have the computer
open a specific URL.


300
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,746
You can have it paste
text that you've liked


301
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:33,736
like your favorite
legalese statement.


302
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:37,816
You can have it paste data like
your favorite corporate logo.


303
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,706
You can have it press
a keyboard shortcut.


304
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,066
You can have it select any
menu in any application


305
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:48,046
and you can even have it
run an Automator workflow


306
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:50,586
or AppleScript or
JavaScript script.


307
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:52,846
And as a matter fact
the OS ships


308
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:55,836
with nine pre-done
Automator workflows for you.


309
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:59,936
The first three here are
for starting a recording


310
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,076
in the QuickTime player.


311
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:02,976
You can say new audio recording,


312
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,066
new screen recording,
new video recording.


313
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:08,806
There is one for going to
the Apple website of course


314
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:13,066
and there are five for
navigating within iTunes.


315
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:16,286
So you can say show me
the top family movies


316
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:18,186
and it will go right
to that page


317
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,246
within the iTunes application.


318
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:24,416
And at the bottom is
a choice for other


319
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,036
that will let you pick
your own Automator workflow


320
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:31,206
or own JavaScript or
AppleScript script and make


321
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,966
that the action that gets run.


322
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:35,786
But you'll notice there is
one for take my picture,


323
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:38,866
so I'm going to select that
and click the Done button


324
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,266
to create this command.


325
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:43,876
And it automatically gets
added to the list of commands.


326
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:48,736
So my user suite now has one
command called take my picture


327
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:51,006
and this is what it looks
like when you run it.


328
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:57,396
So I start dictation, I go
take my picture, it recognizes,


329
00:18:57,656 --> 00:19:04,306
brings up the camera picker, I
smile and it takes my picture


330
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:06,386
and puts it in photos
for me automatically.


331
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:14,016
So user commands are different
than the other types of commands


332
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,446
because they're task oriented.


333
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,496
They're not so much procedural
where you're telling it


334
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:21,656
to do this, then
this, then this.


335
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:25,766
You're basically
giving a command


336
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:30,226
to execute this particular task
no matter how many steps it


337
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:32,316
takes, no matter
what it needs to do.


338
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:36,436
And it really does expose
all the power of automation


339
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:40,036
that is available to you
on the operating system.


340
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:43,786
And you still get all the
other dictation abilities


341
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:45,506
that you currently have
with the other ones.


342
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:49,156
It's hands-free, always
on, visual feedback,


343
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:50,826
you don't need a net connect.


344
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,126
It is incredibly powerful,


345
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:56,506
but as you saw how
many steps it took me


346
00:19:56,506 --> 00:20:01,766
to make a user dictation command
if I wanted to make a hundred


347
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,106
of those to really do
something with a particular app,


348
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:07,056
it might be a little
bit cumbersome


349
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:09,606
to create that until today.


350
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:14,976
Today, there's a set of
custom dictation commands


351
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:17,356
that I'm going to give you today


352
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:22,026
that will let you control
the Finder iWork and Photos


353
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,656
and some of the other apps.


354
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:26,926
And they take advantage
of this automation


355
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:30,526
and speech recognition
technology together.


356
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:36,566
So let me switch over here and
we'll watch these in action.


357
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:43,486
Okay, so I'm getting over a
cold my voice is a bit lower,


358
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:46,056
so we'll see if she even
pays attention to me today.


359
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,856
And I have a mic set
up here because we're


360
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,496
in this huge boomy
[phonetic] room.


361
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:53,006
But let me tell you
when I'm in the office


362
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:57,156
at Apple I just use the computer
it's open there connected


363
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:00,446
to my monitor and I can talk to
this thing from across the room


364
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:01,406
and it works perfectly.


365
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:05,356
So I'm going to be using
this today and I expect one


366
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,626
or two errors, but
let's see what happens.


367
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,056
So let's try that thing


368
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:12,806
about creating a new
presentation in Keynote.


369
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:21,266
Switch to Keynote, make
a new presentation okay.


370
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:25,006
How about let's make
a different one.


371
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:28,216
Make a wide presentation,
oh okay.


372
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:33,686
How about one with a
particular template.


373
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:38,076
Make a new wide presentation
using the gradient template.


374
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:42,456
Oh that's pretty good,
let's try a different theme.


375
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:47,926
Make a new standard presentation
with the brush canvas theme.


376
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:51,536
Pretty good.


377
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:54,486
Close all without saving.


378
00:21:57,606 --> 00:22:02,556
So the whole idea of
having to be procedural


379
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,036
to create a document
you saw me go


380
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:07,226
through all the steps
is now like no.


381
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:11,296
I'm thinking about what I need
to do, give me a new document


382
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,106
with this template, this
width I'm done, I'm there.


383
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:19,166
So that's good for
creating a new document,


384
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,606
let's see how you can work
with an existing document.


385
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,326
So let me pull up a document
that I have on the computer


386
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:29,496
and let's work with
it a little bit.


387
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:32,596
Search spotlight for
presentation the States


388
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:41,000
of the United States,
open result.


389
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:50,046
She's chugging today.


390
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:54,976
Start at the top.


391
00:22:55,516 --> 00:23:02,606
[ Music ]


392
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:05,206
Oh I'm good with slides,
I'm good with slides.


393
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:08,508
[ Music ]


394
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:11,536
Next slide.


395
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:18,016
Go to slide nine.


396
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,206
Read the presenter notes.


397
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:29,176
Read the presenter notes.


398
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:32,816
>> California's diverse
geography ranges


399
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:35,886
from the Sierra Nevada in
the east to the Pacific Coast


400
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:38,646
in the west and from the
redwood forests of the northwest


401
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:41,666
to the Mohave Desert
areas in the southeast.


402
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:47,036
>> Tell me about this image.


403
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:50,666
>> Although Death Valley is a
below sea level basin a great


404
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,526
diversity of life flourishes
in this land of extremes.


405
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,176
>> Take a break.


406
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,656
Take a break.


407
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:07,146
Export the presenter
notes to mail.


408
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,186
Export presenter notes to mail.


409
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:16,576
That's pretty handy I could
use that a couple times.


410
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:20,826
Switch to Keynote.


411
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:25,526
Show related items.


412
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:30,696
So we have a spotlight window
down here with all the items


413
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,896
that are related to this.


414
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:36,516
There's a GarageBand file with
the shaker song in it okay.


415
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:39,256
There's even the email
that I just sent.


416
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,316
There's a bunch of
images that I used.


417
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:45,516
There's a picture
of the US flag.


418
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:51,236
There's also an audio
recording that I put in right,


419
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:53,286
that was the audio
recording and some links.


420
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:57,866
So it was really easy for me
to find things that are related


421
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:02,096
to the document that I'm working
on just by asking for them.


422
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:04,156
Close this without saving.


423
00:25:04,776 --> 00:25:11,436
So you can see this concept


424
00:25:12,146 --> 00:25:16,556
of having task oriented
things is really useful


425
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:20,816
because it doesn't really
interfere with the mental flow


426
00:25:20,816 --> 00:25:24,686
that you have going, especially
when you're creating something.


427
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:28,436
So let me use user commands
and dictation commands


428
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:30,586
to create some content.


429
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:33,806
So we've seen it open a
document, create a new document


430
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:35,476
and we've seen it
work with a document.


431
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:39,456
Let me actually create some
content using these commands.


432
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:43,186
Switch to photos.


433
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:51,216
These are some photos I took on
my trip down the Rhone River.


434
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,326
I took one of those
Viking type cruises.


435
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,696
Lots of fun I highly
recommend that.


436
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:57,856
Select all photos.


437
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:02,466
Help me to add titles.


438
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:08,146
>> Enter the title
for image one of five.


439
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:11,066
>> You know, normally doing this
kind of thing is a real pain


440
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:13,806
because you've got to get down
there in the interface and look


441
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:14,886
at these little things.


442
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:19,396
And, you know, being able
to have this guide you


443
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:22,026
through something sometimes
is just the easiest way


444
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:22,956
to do something.


445
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:26,686
On the Rhone River yeah,


446
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,866
you need that special
character there.


447
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:30,176
Rhone River.


448
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:33,246
>> Five of five.


449
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:35,706
>> This was an incredible
Roman temple right


450
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:38,116
in the middle of town.


451
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:38,986
>> Done.


452
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:43,536
>> So using that command I was
able to add titles to a bunch


453
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,806
of images really quickly.


454
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:53,000
Select all photos, make a
new presentation with these.


455
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:09,036
Okay, so it just did [applause].


456
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,686
Yeah, I mean that's
a pain right,


457
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:16,916
who wants to do the 40 steps
that it takes to do that.


458
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:20,236
I can think of it why can't I
just ask the computer do it,


459
00:27:20,316 --> 00:27:21,806
obviously it can right.


460
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:23,926
Go to slide one.


461
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,936
Change master slide
to title center.


462
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,086
Scratch that.


463
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,606
Change master slide
to title center.


464
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:45,926
And let's see vacation photos.


465
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:59,696
Select Photos, capitalize
that, stop, edit.


466
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:05,516
Okay, let's see what
I've got here.


467
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:09,916
Move the slide to the end.


468
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:11,396
Okay.


469
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:12,946
>> Done.


470
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:15,506
>> And then I want this
to go down around there.


471
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:18,956
I think no, the lock came
first and then that okay.


472
00:28:19,026 --> 00:28:21,906
This needs some tweaking,
this is bad.


473
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,076
Edit this in photos.


474
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:30,546
So the computer knows where
that photo came from doesn't it.


475
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:34,666
Why should I have to go spend my
time doing that kind of thing?


476
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,026
Let's set it to crop and I'll
straighten this out a little bit


477
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:43,216
and then as long as I'm adding
I'm going to crop it to get rid


478
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:44,356
of the guy standing there


479
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,426
and make this a little bit
more interesting, more focused


480
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:51,576
on the lock rather than the
rest of the stuff around it.


481
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:54,996
And Photos has some
nice little tools


482
00:28:54,996 --> 00:29:00,176
for doing that, so
that looks good.


483
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:01,546
Show this in Keynote.


484
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:05,186
Show this in Keynote.


485
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,716
It knows where it
is in Keynote right.


486
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:15,746
Let me select it,
update this image.


487
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:17,476
Update this image.


488
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:23,966
So I don't have to go
through that whole process


489
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:25,646
about doing stuff
I'm just thinking,


490
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:27,376
I'm creating here
on the fly right.


491
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,036
Let's make his little bit bigger


492
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,656
so that it looks a little
bit more interesting.


493
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:37,936
And then -- oh this is
great, the Popes' Palace,


494
00:29:37,936 --> 00:29:38,916
it's really interesting.


495
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:42,616
Show this in Maps.


496
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:52,006
So here it is in Maps and
let's use the nice 3-D feature


497
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,116
of Apple Maps.


498
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:56,566
And let's see if we can get a
nice background for that photo


499
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:59,926
to show people the context and
the fact that the thing's right


500
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:01,976
in the middle of this
old Roman part of town.


501
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,546
You can see the circular
area that was


502
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:08,246
like the original
village there right.


503
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,786
Okay, export this
map to Keynote.


504
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:18,606
All right, very good
and let's kind


505
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:21,296
of crop this in here
a little bit.


506
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:22,306
There we go.


507
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:28,596
I haven't done the command
yet for crop the slide.


508
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:30,756
It's a good idea though.


509
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:33,086
Let's go paste it and
put it to the back here.


510
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:36,146
I'm going to copy this and
put this on top of this,


511
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:37,756
it's like a little trick right.


512
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:41,316
So that I can do like a
magic move and then reveal.


513
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:45,866
So I need to apply a magic move.


514
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:48,066
Apply magic move.


515
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:50,426
Apply a dissolve.


516
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,356
Do that again.


517
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:58,346
Do that again.


518
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:02,336
Do that again.


519
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:08,686
Okay, so I got the transitions
and then oh, Pont du Gard.


520
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:12,016
Okay, this one we need
to fix a little bit.


521
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,426
Scale this to fit slide width.


522
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:19,206
All right, that's good.


523
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:23,426
And make a long panoramic
sequence.


524
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:25,436
>> Done.


525
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:30,806
>> Okay and while we're
at it put descriptions


526
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,976
on top of every image.


527
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:37,716
That could take a while to do.


528
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:43,186
And so after this trip I was so
impressed with these locations


529
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:45,596
that I went on the
Internet, I did some research


530
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:48,586
as to how many people visit
these sites every year.


531
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,236
And I have a spreadsheet
that has that information.


532
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:57,946
Search spotlight for
spreadsheet tourism in France.


533
00:31:59,376 --> 00:31:59,976
Open result.


534
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:08,626
Select the table.


535
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:14,936
Select the table.


536
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:17,536
Export this table to
Keynote as a chart.


537
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,546
Export this table to
Keynote as a chart.


538
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:29,656
Good, that could be handy.


539
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,326
And let's scale this
down a little bit


540
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,176
so that it fits there nice.


541
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:38,736
Okay, start from the top.


542
00:32:39,556 --> 00:32:44,626
All right, so this was a Roman
temple right in the middle


543
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:46,056
of town, it's been
around forever.


544
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,566
They actually turned it into
a movie theater for a while.


545
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:52,546
And this was us going through
a lock on the Rhone River,


546
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:54,946
there's about four or five
locks during the course of that.


547
00:32:55,286 --> 00:32:57,166
This is the power
station that they use


548
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,076
to provide power for Arles.


549
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:02,706
And this is Pont du Gard,


550
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:05,376
which is this incredible
Roman aqueduct


551
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:07,426
that was built like
3,000 years ago.


552
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:11,976
And the fact that this huge
thing that's three stories tall


553
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:15,796
it's still here today and
still in the condition it's


554
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:17,516
in is absolutely amazing.


555
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:23,196
It spans this entire long valley
and I'll bet if we try to do


556
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:26,126
that today it would run in
the billions of dollars.


557
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:27,596
But it's quite impressive.


558
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,926
And that's Pont du Gard.


559
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:36,076
And of course, there
is the Popes' Palace


560
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:40,816
and it's located right in the
center of the old Roman town


561
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:42,086
like you can see here.


562
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,526
And people find these
sites really interesting,


563
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,346
there's millions and
millions means of people


564
00:33:47,346 --> 00:33:48,906
that visit these every year.


565
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,066
Save this presentation.


566
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:59,566
And as a matter fact, why
don't I while I'm at it,


567
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:02,446
but I don't have
a free port here.


568
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,736
Let's see if I can copy
this to my thumb drive.


569
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:11,456
So I'm going to stick
a thumb drive in here.


570
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:15,406
Save this presentation to
my thumb drive and eject it.


571
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,216
Scratch that.


572
00:34:21,456 --> 00:34:23,755
Scratch that.


573
00:34:24,726 --> 00:34:29,246
Save this presentation to
my thumb drive and eject it.


574
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,536
>> Saving document
vacation photos


575
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,146
to drive digital briefcase.


576
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:35,985
Dismounting digital briefcase.


577
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:41,996
>> So this is the kind of thing
that you can do where, you know,


578
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,856
you're still in the
application you don't have


579
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:46,146
to leave what you're doing
to dismount something,


580
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:47,815
to eject something,
to copy something.


581
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:48,045
>> Done.


582
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,896
>> That deals something
with the Finder.


583
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:52,306
I mean you just tell
the computer to do it.


584
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:54,176
It knows how to do
this stuff right.


585
00:34:54,496 --> 00:34:57,306
Why shouldn't we just be
able to tell it to do that?


586
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:00,356
So where do you get this stuff?


587
00:35:01,686 --> 00:35:03,000
Add a blank slide.


588
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:28,506
Turn this into a QR code.


589
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,986
Scale down 10%.


590
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:37,496
Scale down 10%.


591
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,486
Scale down 10%.


592
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:43,136
There we go.


593
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:48,036
So all of this material is
available for to you today


594
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,506
and I'm going to show
you where to get it.


595
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:57,926
So let's go back to the slides
here and my slide advancer.


596
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:01,926
So what are these type
of commands useful for?


597
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:05,956
Well we saw that they're really
good for when you want to remain


598
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:09,436
in context and you want actions
and tasks performed for you.


599
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:13,646
They are really good for
performing multistep tasks


600
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,786
and like when I had to
go through and name all


601
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:19,726
of those images, so that I could
use their descriptions later.


602
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:23,476
They're also good for tasks
that require dexterity.


603
00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:28,616
Can you imagine copying the
description from an image file


604
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:32,956
on a slide and then creating a
text box, placing it just so on


605
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:35,676
that and doing that for
an entire presentation?


606
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:39,416
Boy, you have to be a wizard
to be able to do that quickly.


607
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:41,376
But with voice command,


608
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:45,016
with a dictation command that's
just asking that be done.


609
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:47,286
You can also move data.


610
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:52,126
So like I had the map in Maps,
I wanted it over in Keynote.


611
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:55,856
So voice commands and dictation
commands are perfect for that


612
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:59,016
and excellent for
data transformation.


613
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:04,466
So I had a table with data that
I wanted as a chart in Keynote


614
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:08,316
and I was able to give it a
command and have that executed.


615
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:12,756
You can perform tasks
that aren't available


616
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:14,836
in the application
UI that you're in.


617
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:17,726
For example, turn
this into a QR code.


618
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:20,436
That's a perfect example of
something you'd want to do


619
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:23,686
in a presentation, but
it's just not there.


620
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:28,736
And things that the user wants
to do, but doesn't know how.


621
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:31,526
Man, all the people in
my family do not know how


622
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:35,296
to use the Clipboard, do not
know how to do a screen capture,


623
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:37,526
do not know how to use AirDrop.


624
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:41,166
So being able to do that with
a spoken dictation command


625
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:41,996
is perfect.


626
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:44,976
So what are they good for?


627
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:49,106
Dictation commands are good for
solving all of these problems


628
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:51,056
and for being a solution.


629
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,206
So how does it work?


630
00:37:55,826 --> 00:38:00,776
Well, I only have a couple
minutes so I'm going to kind


631
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:06,586
of boot out of that for a second
and jump past that section.


632
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:11,426
It's basically magic and
I'm going to kick back in


633
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:16,456
and tell you where to go
to get these resources.


634
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:19,036
Everything you need to
know about how they work


635
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:22,776
and the collection I just
showed you is available for you


636
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:24,986
on dictationcommands.com.


637
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:30,236
So to summarize, the power
of speech recognition


638
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:33,726
and automation working
together makes it


639
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:37,326
so that dictation is no
longer just another way


640
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:39,956
to enter text into a text field.


641
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:44,456
And speech is no longer just
an assistive technology.


642
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:50,426
And now voice is a peer
to touch, keys and cursor.


643
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:53,476
You can use your
voice the same way


644
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:56,016
that you use the other
inputs into the computer.


645
00:38:57,286 --> 00:39:02,466
And this is what's possible
when you have macOS and all


646
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,336
of these technologies
working together.


647
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:06,636
It's only something that
can happen on a Mac.


648
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:10,416
So thank you so much for
being part of my day.


649
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,646
Thank you for being here.


650
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:14,496
Thank you for being part of
this session I appreciate it.


651
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:20,500
