[ Background Conversation ]


2
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:22,716
>> Good morning.


3
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:26,006
I'm glad you could make it.


4
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,676
My name is Robb, and together


5
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:28,786
with my coworkers, Wenson and


6
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:29,756
Tom, I'm going to take you on a


7
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:31,326
deep dive today through the new


8
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:32,485
eight drag-and-drop APIs we are


9
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:34,216
introducing in iOS 11.


10
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:36,776
So, we have a bunch of new APIs


11
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:38,166
for you, but I don't want you to


12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:38,866
get intimidated.


13
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:40,066
Even though we have a lot of


14
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,656
ground to cover, you can


15
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:44,186
gradually adopt these APIs and,


16
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:45,466
in fact, if you are one of the


17
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,006
few people who use Collection


18
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,176
view or Table view, there is a


19
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:49,296
dedicated session for you


20
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,886
tomorrow in Hall 2 that you can


21
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,216
check out, and it's followed


22
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:54,526
back-to-back by one on


23
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,406
NSItemProvider.


24
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:57,156
If you ever wondered what the U


25
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,736
in UDI stands for, do not miss


26
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:00,236
this session.


27
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:02,126
This session, however, is going


28
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:03,126
to split in two halves.


29
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,336
First, we're going to talk about


30
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:05,536
the drag side of things, the


31
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,996
drag interactions, it's


32
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:08,476
delegate, the session, the


33
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:09,476
associated drag item and


34
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:11,006
previews, and then Tom is going


35
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,226
to take over in the second half,


36
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:13,656
and do a similar thing for the


37
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,256
drop side.


38
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:16,546
So, we have a lot of stuff to


39
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:17,756
talk about, and we're going to


40
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:19,296
start with advanced drag


41
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:19,926
interactions.


42
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:22,516
So, as you already know, drag


43
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,016
and drop on iOS is not only a


44
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,106
way to share data between


45
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:27,676
applications, it's also a fluid


46
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:29,296
user interaction, and with these


47
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,156
kinds of complex user


48
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:33,686
interactions, consistency is


49
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:34,786
key, and you achieve this


50
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:36,186
consistency by using


51
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:37,166
UIDragInteraction.


52
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:38,316
You can take one of those and


53
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:39,916
install it on any of your views.


54
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:40,966
You don't have to subclass


55
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,026
anything, or even worse, go in


56
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:43,796
and change the existing


57
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:45,096
superclass of the custom views.


58
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:46,596
Just install one of them, and it


59
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:47,886
will do the necessary gesture


60
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:48,716
bookkeeping for you.


61
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:50,106
You do, however, have to


62
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:51,346
implement


63
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:53,716
UIDragInteractionDelegate, which


64
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:55,426
at least return a UIDragItem.


65
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,386
You can [inaudible] into a bunch


66
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:59,556
of notifications about lifecycle


67
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:00,926
and perform some animations, and


68
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:03,076
we'll go over those in a second.


69
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:05,196
If none of this makes any sense


70
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:06,346
to you, I would recommend you


71
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:07,786
catch up on Introducing Drag and


72
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:08,976
Drop, which is a session we had


73
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:10,946
yesterday, so if you missed it,


74
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,456
you will have to check out the


75
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:14,626
video, and that will kind of


76
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:15,336
cover the basics.


77
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,176
However, if the basics were good


78
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:18,696
enough, you wouldn't be here


79
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:20,096
today, so let's look at some of


80
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,536
the behaviors that native


81
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:24,116
applications in iOS 11 employ,


82
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:25,626
and what your users will come to


83
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:26,676
expect of your applications,


84
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:27,136
going forward.


85
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:30,586
So, here you see me in Mail, and


86
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:31,876
you can see that, as I start a


87
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,446
drag with a long press on a


88
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,516
message, I can then tap


89
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:36,366
subsequent messages and they


90
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:39,016
will flock to the drag session


91
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:40,396
that I have already in progress,


92
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:41,836
so the little batch count keeps


93
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:42,346
increasing, there.


94
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,796
This is not something you get


95
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,286
out of the box for free, but


96
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:46,426
it's not very hard to implement,


97
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:47,176
either, and I'm going to show


98
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:47,596
you how.


99
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,726
So, in this example, I've


100
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:50,556
already implemented


101
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:51,776
UIDragInteractionDelegate,


102
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:54,556
specifically the required method


103
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:55,276
dragInteraction


104
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,076
itemsForBeginning session, in


105
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,866
which I create an NSItemProvider


106
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,796
for the message I want to drag,


107
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,996
then I create a UIDragItem with


108
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,846
said itemProvider set to


109
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:07,726
localObject to the message, so I


110
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,466
can later easily refer back to


111
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,226
the message, and then I return


112
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:12,086
the dropped-in array.


113
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,846
Now, you could use the exact


114
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:15,906
same implementation for


115
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:17,306
dragInteraction itemsForAddingTo


116
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,106
session withTouchAt point, and


117
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:19,646
that would work.


118
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:21,416
However, there is some edge


119
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,886
cases that I want you to think


120
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,416
about as you implement flocking


121
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,836
by opting into this method.


122
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,176
First, if you implement this


123
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,676
method, your dragInteraction can


124
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,126
now flock with any other


125
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:32,246
dragInteraction in your


126
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,416
application, not with


127
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,216
dragInteractions in other


128
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:35,246
applications, because we


129
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,086
currently don't allow


130
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:37,686
cross-application flocking, but


131
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:38,876
that dragInteractionDelegate


132
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,236
that Bob's implementing in that


133
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:41,916
other department, you can


134
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:42,946
potentially flock with that, so


135
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:43,916
you want to be aware.


136
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,536
In this case, I decided that I


137
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
only want to flock my messages


138
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:51,226
with other messages, so I


139
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:52,356
iterate over all the items in


140
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:54,016
the session, and if any of them


141
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:56,736
does not have an NSItemProvider


142
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,556
that has a UDI conforming to


143
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,136
this type, in this example,


144
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,956
private.example.mail, I'll abort


145
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:03,876
by returning an empty array, and


146
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:04,886
this will give other gesture


147
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:07,086
recognizes to recognize the tap


148
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,256
that triggered this flocking


149
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:08,936
attempt.


150
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,646
Similarly, by default, the same


151
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,176
dragInteraction, therefore the


152
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:15,846
same UI view can flock multiple


153
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:16,726
times.


154
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,935
We can't possibly know if that


155
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:18,676
makes sense for your


156
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,086
application, or if maybe


157
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,316
different regions inside your


158
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,676
view correspond to different


159
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,456
drag items, so you have to tell


160
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:25,606
us.


161
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:26,786
And, in this case, I check if


162
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:28,226
the local object of any of the


163
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,516
other items already in the


164
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:30,786
session correspond to the


165
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:31,896
message that I want to check


166
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,506
now, and if it's already there,


167
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:34,986
I also abort, using an empty


168
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:35,236
array.


169
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:36,616
So, this is how you get


170
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:37,016
flocking.


171
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,326
Another behavior that Mail has


172
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,346
is this.


173
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,176
As I long-press on a thread,


174
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:45,976
instead of lifting one item that


175
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:49,076
represents the thread, one item,


176
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:51,296
I instead lift three that each


177
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,756
represent a message in this


178
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,016
thread, as indicated by the


179
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:57,096
little blue bubble, there.


180
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,186
As we've already seen,


181
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:00,706
UIDragInteractionDelegates drag


182
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:02,366
item itemsForBeginning session


183
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,666
returns an array, so it stands


184
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,646
to reason we can, in fact,


185
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:06,276
return multiple items here, and


186
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,416
then that's something I'll do


187
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:08,626
here.


188
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,466
So, I grab all the messages from


189
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:13,596
my mailThread, I sort them, and


190
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:14,646
I'll explain why in a second,


191
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,126
and then I return a UIDragItem


192
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,156
for each of them in the exact


193
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:20,026
same fashion that you've seen


194
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:20,336
before.


195
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:21,716
Now, the reason that I'm sorting


196
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,686
them is that the order of the


197
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:24,576
array that you return here


198
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,696
matters, and it's so that the


199
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:27,586
last item in the array is going


200
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:29,346
to be the topmost object of your


201
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,196
lift, and since I want the


202
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,716
newest message first, I sort


203
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:33,876
them so that the oldest is the


204
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,596
first in the array.


205
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:35,966
And, this would work.


206
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:37,536
However, if this was all we


207
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:41,006
implemented, all the items would


208
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,996
lift with the same preview.


209
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,016
That means they would have the


210
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:45,366
same visual representation and,


211
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:46,856
by default, the preview that we


212
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,846
create is going to be based on


213
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:49,856
the view that the interaction is


214
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:51,036
installed on, so that would mean


215
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:52,146
that all three messages would


216
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:53,826
have the thread as their visual


217
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:54,486
representation.


218
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,246
And, since I don't want that, I


219
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,286
implement the optional


220
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:58,006
dragInteraction


221
00:05:58,006 --> 00:05:59,536
previewForLifting item session,


222
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:00,956
in which I get to return my own


223
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:01,476
drag preview.


224
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,096
So, what I do here is, I first


225
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,336
attempt to find the message


226
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:08,496
associated with that item, and


227
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,456
if I have it, I grab its


228
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:11,686
associated message views through


229
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:12,856
its helper method I happen to


230
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,246
have, and initialize my


231
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:16,186
UITargetedDragPreview with that.


232
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,116
And, that would mean that all of


233
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,286
the messages that I'm lifting


234
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,106
would have their own


235
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,426
representation based on the


236
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:23,766
message view dedicated to them.


237
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,336
And, last but not least, here's


238
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,806
another thing that Mail can do


239
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,756
that is kind of tricky.


240
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,456
You see me here dragging photos


241
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:35,146
from Photos to Mail, and if you


242
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,696
pay attention, you'll notice


243
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,786
that the photos lift into an


244
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,066
appropriate size for the entire


245
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,146
width of the compose sheet.


246
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,926
So, how is it that Mail already


247
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,256
knows how much room to make, and


248
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,426
where to target the preview?


249
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:49,916
Is it because the data just


250
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,226
happened to arrive so quickly?


251
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,746
No. You should not make any


252
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,386
assumptions here.


253
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:56,826
In my demos, the data's going to


254
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:58,186
arrive in time, but that may not


255
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:00,186
be the case for your users, and


256
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,116
there's a better way to handle


257
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:01,706
this situation.


258
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:04,176
It turns out that NSItemProvider


259
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:06,146
has a property called


260
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,356
preferredPresentationSize, which


261
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:09,436
allows you to communicate the


262
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:10,726
size that you expect something


263
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:11,826
to be represented at on the


264
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:12,926
other side, kind of out of


265
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:14,686
channel, so even though I'm


266
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,166
initializing the NSItemProvider


267
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,486
with the file here, I happen to


268
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:18,896
know the size, and I can set its


269
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,016
preferredPresentationSize


270
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:21,476
accordingly, and then Mail is


271
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:22,546
able to read that out on the


272
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,126
other side, and everything else


273
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:24,996
is just the same.


274
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,446
Now, you can take my word for it


275
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,806
that this works, but we've only


276
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:29,976
known each other for what, nine


277
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:30,266
minutes?


278
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:31,956
So, Wenson's going to show you a


279
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:33,526
demo now.


280
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:41,636
[ Applause ]


281
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:42,526
>> Alright.


282
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:43,156
Thank you, Robb.


283
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,096
>> So now, before I jump into


284
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,356
the demo, there's a couple of


285
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:51,166
things I'd like to say.


286
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:53,056
All of the sample code that I'm


287
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,586
about to show you will all be


288
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,426
available online, and I strongly


289
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:57,346
encourage you all to check it


290
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:57,636
out.


291
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,536
Second of all, we will be going


292
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:01,236
over not one but two demo apps


293
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:01,506
today.


294
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,236
First one is called Drag Source,


295
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,696
and it will focus on drag


296
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:05,306
interactions.


297
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,346
Second one, Drop Destination,


298
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,676
will focus, as you might have


299
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:09,876
guessed, on the drop side.


300
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,966
So, with that said, let's take a


301
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:15,266
look at our first demo app.


302
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:19,236
So, in here, we see four stacks


303
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:22,516
of images, and currently, we


304
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:24,026
have implemented very basic


305
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,996
cases of drag interactions, so


306
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:27,396
we're able to drag a single


307
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:28,776
image out of each stack.


308
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,816
So, that works great, but it


309
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:33,076
would be kind of cool if we


310
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:34,946
could drag an entire stack of


311
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,876
images out as individual items,


312
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:37,996
one per each image.


313
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:39,546
So, let's take a look at the


314
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:40,785
code and see what we can do.


315
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:43,726
Now, currently, if you look at


316
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:45,916
this, we just consider the last


317
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,676
image view, and use it to create


318
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:50,046
a new drag item, just using that


319
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:50,776
last image view.


320
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:52,746
Instead, it's a pretty short


321
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,266
stretch to enumerate through all


322
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,606
of our available image views and


323
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:59,206
return drag item for each one.


324
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,926
So, we're going to do just that,


325
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:02,916
and now let's see how it


326
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,436
behaves.


327
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,636
So, watch what happens when I


328
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:07,306
begin a drag on the second stack


329
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:07,886
of images.


330
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,196
You'll notice that there's a


331
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,746
badge count of three this time.


332
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:12,876
That indicates that there are


333
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:13,996
three items in the drag,


334
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:15,176
corresponding to the three


335
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:16,196
images in the stack.


336
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,066
Now, if I bring up Photos on my


337
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,706
right side, here, you'll notice


338
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:23,496
that I can actually drop these


339
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,266
three images into Photos, and


340
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,976
it'll save them as individual


341
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:28,346
items.


342
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,356
Now, while we're in Photos,


343
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:31,166
there's something else I'd like


344
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:31,646
to show you.


345
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:34,586
So, I've begun a drag on one of


346
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:36,636
these images, and now, if I tap


347
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:38,386
on these other two images,


348
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:39,676
you'll see that we add those to


349
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:41,106
the existing drag session as


350
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:41,616
well.


351
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:43,506
So, as Robb mentioned, this is


352
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:44,896
not a behavior we get for free.


353
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:46,506
Luckily, it's pretty easy to


354
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:47,916
implement, and I'll show you


355
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:48,126
how.


356
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,096
So, going back to the code, all


357
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:51,946
we've got to implement is


358
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:53,246
itemsForAddingTo session.


359
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,706
So, the thing to notice here is


360
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,286
that we can actually use the


361
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:59,296
exact same logic to construct


362
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:01,086
drag items in itemsForAddingTo


363
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:03,086
session as in itemsForBeginning


364
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:03,466
session.


365
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,776
So, to make this easier for


366
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,026
ourselves, we'll just take the


367
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:08,456
logic that used to have in


368
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:09,746
itemsForBeginning session and


369
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,616
introduce a new helper method.


370
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,466
I'm going to call this dragItems


371
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:13,946
for session.


372
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,056
Then, in both places, when we


373
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:18,226
are adding to an existing


374
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:21,526
session, right here, and when we


375
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,886
are creating a new session in


376
00:10:23,886 --> 00:10:25,716
itemsForBeginning session, we'll


377
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:27,076
simply turn around and call this


378
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:27,566
new helper.


379
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:31,466
OK? So, that should give us the


380
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:34,236
ability to add more images into


381
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,176
our existing drag session, and


382
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,036
as you can see, as I tap on each


383
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:39,186
of these other three views,


384
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:42,116
we're able to add all 10 images


385
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,416
into the drag session.


386
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,216
So, that works pretty well, but


387
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:46,986
there's one caveat.


388
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:49,166
So, notice here, I'm going to


389
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,276
start a drag on the first stack


390
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,616
of images, and I'm just going to


391
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:52,616
keep on tapping the first stack


392
00:10:52,616 --> 00:10:53,196
of images.


393
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,606
So, you can see that I'm able to


394
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:56,946
arbitrarily add a whole ton of


395
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,546
images that I probably shouldn't


396
00:10:58,546 --> 00:10:59,166
be able to add.


397
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,656
This seems like a bug to me.


398
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,916
I have 26 copies of each image


399
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,916
now in the drag session.


400
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,316
So, let's figure out how we can


401
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:06,776
fix that.


402
00:11:07,696 --> 00:11:09,396
Now, here's our helper that we


403
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:11,826
just introduced, and what we can


404
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,496
do here is, instead of using all


405
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:14,476
the imageViews to create


406
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,126
dragItems every single time we


407
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,816
tap, what we're going to do is


408
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,086
filter out the imageViews, so we


409
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:20,516
don't use an imageView to create


410
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:22,106
more than one dragItem.


411
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:25,606
So, with those three lines of


412
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,636
code, I'm going to hop back into


413
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:29,866
the app and show you how it


414
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:30,936
works.


415
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,686
OK. So now, I've begun a drag on


416
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,696
the first stack of images, and


417
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:35,756
I'm going to tap the next three


418
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:36,146
stacks.


419
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:37,666
Now, watch what happens when I


420
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,936
try to add more items.


421
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,486
Our bug seems to be fixed.


422
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:42,826
We can no longer add redundant


423
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:44,286
items to our drag session.


424
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,056
So, these were just some basics


425
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:47,396
for manipulating the drag items


426
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,256
that we supplied through our


427
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:48,826
delegates.


428
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:50,426
I'd like to now hand it back to


429
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,646
Robb to discuss some of the more


430
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,176
advanced techniques for


431
00:11:54,176 --> 00:11:55,916
customizing animations and drag


432
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:56,426
previews.


433
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:04,546
[ Applause ]


434
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,076
>> So, let's add some polish to


435
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:07,716
our previews.


436
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,906
One thing that's often the case


437
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,676
is that the view that you want


438
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:14,956
to lift is not quite ready for


439
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,356
prime time, so maybe there's


440
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:17,656
some highlighting state, or you


441
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:18,956
have some overlay that you want


442
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:19,456
to fade out.


443
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,306
And, the lift is actually a


444
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,956
great point to do that, because


445
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,946
during the lift, the view is


446
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,406
still live, so any changes you


447
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,086
make inside of that view will be


448
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,606
reflected during the animation,


449
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:31,456
and it's only that, at the point


450
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,696
where the user starts moving


451
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,216
their finger that we perform a


452
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:37,226
snapshot, and that state is what


453
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,466
the user will see for the rest


454
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,296
of the drag interaction.


455
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,806
The way you could animate


456
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:45,636
alongside the lift is like so.


457
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:47,286
There is an option delegate


458
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:48,406
method, dragInteraction


459
00:12:48,406 --> 00:12:49,796
willAnimateLiftWith animator


460
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,526
session, in which you get handed


461
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:54,696
an animator object, and here I'm


462
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:57,206
going to just grab all the


463
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:58,756
messages that I have on the


464
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:00,016
items in the session, and find


465
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,356
their associated messageViews.


466
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:02,826
So now, I have an array of


467
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,296
messageViews, and for each of


468
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,426
them, I will just add an


469
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:08,406
animation to the animator in


470
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:09,906
which I fade out an overlay by


471
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,056
setting its alpha to zero.


472
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,266
And then, in the completion


473
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,866
block, I will set the alpha back


474
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,176
to one, and what that will do is


475
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:18,576
that as the view lifts up, the


476
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,646
overlay will fade out.


477
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:21,456
If the user lets go and the view


478
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:22,456
settles back into place, the


479
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:23,806
overlay will fade in, because


480
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:24,976
the animator is able to


481
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,206
automatically revert this


482
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:26,676
animation.


483
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:28,716
Then, when the drag starts, we


484
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,266
will snapshot the view, and


485
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,536
after that, the completion block


486
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:33,086
will get called, and the overlay


487
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:34,896
will be reinstalled.


488
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:37,436
So, that means in the snapshot,


489
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:38,636
there won't be an overlay, but


490
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:39,616
in the view that remains inside


491
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,736
the application, there will be.


492
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:42,706
But, what if the view that


493
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:45,356
you're lifting, the view that


494
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,416
you're lifting is not the view


495
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,076
that the interaction is


496
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,306
installed on, or what if the


497
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:51,266
view isn't square, or what else


498
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:51,676
can we do?


499
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:53,056
So, we already saw that


500
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,536
UIDragPreview can be initialized


501
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:55,756
with the view, but there are two


502
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:57,466
other parameters, and I'll go


503
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:58,566
over each of them individually.


504
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:00,906
The first is a parameters object


505
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,426
that allows you to customize the


506
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,086
appearance, and the second one


507
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,076
is a target that's used for


508
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:05,536
positioning.


509
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,756
So first, the parameters.


510
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,116
That is an instance of


511
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,786
UIDragPreviewParameters, and it


512
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:11,676
has two properties.


513
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,136
The first is a color, and that's


514
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,286
going to be the background color


515
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,676
of the view that we will install


516
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:17,346
behind your view, because a lot


517
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:18,366
of views aren't actually fully


518
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,486
opaque, and it would look not so


519
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,886
good if we just lifted them as


520
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:22,256
they are.


521
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,366
However, you get to customize


522
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,776
this color in any way you want.


523
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:27,536
You can make it black, or clear.


524
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,376
You can really go to town, here.


525
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:31,516
The second property is a little


526
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,236
more complicated.


527
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:35,336
It's a UIBezierPath that lets us


528
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:37,346
know what the visible region of


529
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,396
your view should be, so if your


530
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,426
view is not square, you could


531
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:42,546
set a rounded rectangle here.


532
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,576
But, there are some things to be


533
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:44,926
aware of.


534
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:46,596
So, by default, if you don't


535
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,236
supply drag preview parameters,


536
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:50,676
so you don't set a path on the


537
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:52,026
drag preview parameters you


538
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:53,696
supply, we will lift the entire


539
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:53,926
view.


540
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:56,206
If you wanted to crop out the


541
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:57,786
subrect phon, so in this case,


542
00:14:57,786 --> 00:14:58,856
the rounded rectangle with the


543
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,236
kid in it, you could supply a


544
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:02,176
Bezier path, and it would result


545
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:03,136
in something like this.


546
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:04,976
So, it's important, however,


547
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:07,476
that the Bezier path that you


548
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:09,486
supply has to make sense within


549
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:10,526
the coordinate space of the


550
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:10,806
view.


551
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:12,006
So, in this case, the bounds


552
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,176
that I initialized this rounded


553
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,896
rectangle with have an origin


554
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:16,586
that is relative to the origin


555
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:18,436
of the container, as indicated


556
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,526
in gray, sorry, as, the origin


557
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:21,956
of the view, as indicated in


558
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:23,256
gray, so that's the top left


559
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:23,586
corner.


560
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:25,826
And, you want to also make note


561
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,126
of the midpoint, because it's


562
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,306
the midpoint of the visible path


563
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,646
that we'll later use for


564
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:30,836
positioning, when we talk about


565
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:31,216
target.


566
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:33,566
So, this is how you would get


567
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:35,206
this kind of preview.


568
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:36,816
However, you're not limited to


569
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,556
giving us a path that is smaller


570
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:39,426
than the view.


571
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:41,376
You can also give us one that's


572
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:41,656
bigger.


573
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,016
So, in this case, I chose an


574
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:45,196
origin that is negative, and it


575
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:46,046
works in the [inaudible] of the


576
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,536
view, and that would result in


577
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:49,086
this kind of platter that frames


578
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:49,536
the picture.


579
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:50,526
And, the color you see here is


580
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:51,906
in fact a background color that


581
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:52,636
defaulted to white.


582
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:54,546
Now, if you're bold enough to


583
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:55,416
implement your own text


584
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,936
rendering, there's a dedicated,


585
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:59,236
thank you, style that you can


586
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:01,856
use to match the way that we


587
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,626
lift text, so you want to refer


588
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:05,816
to the documentation for that.


589
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:08,336
And, the target, so the target


590
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:10,696
is used to position a transitory


591
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:12,266
view that we will use to perform


592
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,376
the animation with inside your


593
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:13,926
view hierarchy.


594
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,136
If you don't supply your target,


595
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:17,386
we will infer one based on the


596
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:18,396
superview of the view that you


597
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:18,866
provided.


598
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:20,906
That means if you provide a view


599
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:22,996
as your view in the direct, in


600
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:25,026
the targeted direct preview, if


601
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:27,446
that view is not in the view


602
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,716
hierarchy, you will have to


603
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:29,436
supply your target.


604
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:31,396
Otherwise, we can infer one.


605
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:33,746
This UIDragPreviewTarget has


606
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,426
three parameters.


607
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,336
The first is the container.


608
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:36,106
This is where we're going to


609
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:37,576
install the view, so you want to


610
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,366
be aware of any add or remove


611
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,806
subview calls in that container.


612
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:42,756
And, the second one is a


613
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:44,116
position, and the third is a


614
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:44,596
transform.


615
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:45,686
The transform is only relevant


616
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:46,916
on drop, and it allows you to


617
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,326
rotate or scale on set down.


618
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,466
The position, however, is a


619
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,376
little more tricky.


620
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,706
So, as I mentioned, if you give


621
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:56,076
us a point in your container, as


622
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,476
indicated in gray, by default we


623
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,216
will center the midpoint of your


624
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:01,346
view around this position, so if


625
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,126
you don't supply a visible path,


626
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:04,276
it would look like so.


627
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:05,806
However, if you do supply a


628
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:07,695
visible path, then as I said,


629
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:10,836
the midpoint of the bounds of


630
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:12,146
this path will be centered


631
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:12,836
around this point.


632
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:14,236
So, it's no longer the midpoint


633
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:14,766
of the view.


634
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,205
It's the midpoint of the visible


635
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:16,536
path.


636
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,986
And, it also means that if your


637
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:18,886
path is a little bit more


638
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:21,205
complicated, such as this one,


639
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:22,836
where I just unioned two rounded


640
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,205
rectangles together, the


641
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,415
midpoint is now not even in any


642
00:17:26,415 --> 00:17:27,556
of the two rectangles.


643
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:28,746
It's still the midpoint of the


644
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:29,996
enclosing bounds of both of


645
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:30,486
these shapes.


646
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:33,506
But, if you already had a chance


647
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,986
to look at iOS 11, you have


648
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:36,466
noticed that a lot of the apps


649
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:38,026
in the system are actually able


650
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,926
to update the preview after the


651
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,426
lift, so here you can see Maps,


652
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,676
and as I move this little Apple


653
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,536
Park cell around, it gets


654
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:47,786
replaced by this little map


655
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:49,386
snippet after the fact.


656
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:50,846
So, how can we do that?


657
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:51,906
Well, it turns out, there's a


658
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,496
second preview class in the


659
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:54,716
systems, next to


660
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:55,866
UITargetedDragPreview, and that


661
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,506
is UIDragPreview which, as you


662
00:17:58,506 --> 00:17:59,266
might have guessed, is very


663
00:17:59,266 --> 00:17:59,766
similar to


664
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,766
UITargetedDragPreview, but it


665
00:18:01,766 --> 00:18:03,406
doesn't have a target.


666
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:04,636
All the other semantics still


667
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,366
apply, and the view that you


668
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,836
initialize this preview with may


669
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:09,606
or may not be in the view


670
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:09,976
hierarchy.


671
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:11,006
It's not relevant anymore, at


672
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,406
this point.


673
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:14,146
But, how will you update this


674
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:14,566
preview?


675
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:17,396
First, you want to find a spot


676
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,366
in your session lifecycle where


677
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:19,906
it's appropriate.


678
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:21,526
So, in this case, I chose


679
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:22,986
sessionDidMove, and what I want


680
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:24,756
to do here is that as the user


681
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,946
moves out of the listView in my


682
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:28,716
hypothetical Mail app, I want to


683
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:29,886
replace what they're dragging


684
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,056
with a little envelope graphic.


685
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,796
So first, I perform a hit check


686
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,456
to see if I'm still inside the


687
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:35,566
listView, and if I am, I just


688
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:36,916
abort by returning nothing.


689
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:39,646
And then, I iterate over all the


690
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:41,716
items that have a message as


691
00:18:41,716 --> 00:18:43,046
their localObject.


692
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:45,536
I check if I have already


693
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:46,776
updated this item, because this


694
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:47,946
operation is not free, and


695
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:49,736
sessionDidMove may get called


696
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,336
quite frequently, but if I


697
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,586
haven't, then I will set the


698
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,986
previewProvider, and this is a


699
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:56,396
block that we will later call to


700
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,206
update the preview, and inside


701
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,166
the block, I first create an


702
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,316
imageView with the image I would


703
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:02,536
like, and then I initialize a


704
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:03,976
new drag preview with this, and


705
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,166
it's important to realize that


706
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:06,886
we may not actually call in this


707
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:07,256
block.


708
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:09,766
So, if you are lifting many


709
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:11,476
messages, we may not, we may


710
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:12,616
decide not to display all of


711
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:13,826
them, and we wouldn't bother


712
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,036
calling in a preview block for


713
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:15,986
the views that we don't actually


714
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:16,576
show on the screen.


715
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:18,436
And, last but not least, I have


716
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:19,296
to do some bookkeeping.


717
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,846
So, theory is still second to


718
00:19:21,846 --> 00:19:23,036
practice, and Wenson's going to


719
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,136
give you another demo, and I'll


720
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:24,726
see you in the last.


721
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:25,076
Thank you.


722
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:30,546
[ Applause ]


723
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:31,256
>> Alright.


724
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:32,316
Thanks again, Robb.


725
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,176
So now, I'd like to introduce


726
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,216
the second example we are going


727
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,646
to be looking at in Drag Source.


728
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:39,266
So, check this out.


729
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,806
When I drag on this image of two


730
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,296
QR codes, we have a drag session


731
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:45,686
that contains two items.


732
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:46,996
What are these two items?


733
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,446
Well, if I drop it in Photos,


734
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:49,486
we'll see that it's actually the


735
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:50,936
cropped images of the QR codes.


736
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:51,946
So, I've gone ahead and


737
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:53,196
detected, where are the QR codes


738
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:54,746
are already in this image?


739
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:56,546
Now, the thing we can polish


740
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,576
here is the drag preview.


741
00:19:58,796 --> 00:19:59,496
So, we haven't done any


742
00:19:59,496 --> 00:19:59,976
customization yet.


743
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,866
And so, by default, we use the


744
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,446
entire image view to represent


745
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:06,176
either of the items, either of


746
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,406
the QR codes.


747
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,336
That is, we are actually seeing


748
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:11,586
the entire image view twice, two


749
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,536
of them stacked on top of each


750
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:12,746
other.


751
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:14,456
It would be kind of cool if we


752
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:16,026
could use just the cropped image


753
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:17,336
of the QR code as the drag


754
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,106
preview as we are lifting, and


755
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:19,956
when we are dragging them


756
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:20,316
around.


757
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:22,726
So, let's take a look at what we


758
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:23,956
need to do this.


759
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,336
First thing we're going to do is


760
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,736
implement previewForLifting


761
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,596
item, so in here, we're going to


762
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:30,756
take some information about the


763
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:32,896
QR code, namely the cropped


764
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,526
image of the QR code, as well as


765
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,886
some geometry describing where


766
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,146
it is in the image, and we're


767
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:38,346
going to use it to create a new


768
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:39,226
UIImageView.


769
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:41,346
Then, we're going to create a


770
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:43,316
drag preview target and drag


771
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:44,296
preview parameters.


772
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:45,776
Note that right here we set the


773
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,136
visiblePath to a new


774
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:48,156
UIBezierPath that's a


775
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:49,546
roundedRect, and that will give


776
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:51,006
us a nice rounded preview.


777
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:52,406
So, we combine all of this


778
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:53,826
information into a new targeted


779
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:55,956
drag preview, and with this


780
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:58,616
change, we should see a much


781
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,276
more polished drag preview when


782
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:01,546
we lift.


783
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:03,626
Now, check out what happens when


784
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:04,366
I begin to lift.


785
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:06,286
So, instead of the entire image


786
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:07,666
view popping up this time, we


787
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,496
see individual rects for the QR


788
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,126
codes get lifted up, and as I


789
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,666
drag, you can see that these are


790
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,516
the two QR codes flying around,


791
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,686
so that looks pretty good, but


792
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:20,706
there's something that looks


793
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:21,916
kind of weird, and I'm about to


794
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,216
show you.


795
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,266
Watch what happens to the QR


796
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,736
codes when I let go.


797
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:26,176
Now, I've let go somewhere that


798
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:26,876
doesn't actually accept the


799
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:28,456
drop, and so we'll do a cancel


800
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:28,926
animation.


801
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,476
The problem is that we haven't


802
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,476
actually told UIKit where the


803
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:34,116
drag preview should animate to


804
00:21:34,116 --> 00:21:34,766
when we cancel.


805
00:21:35,316 --> 00:21:36,376
So, let's fix that problem.


806
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:38,406
We're going to do that by


807
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:39,046
implementing


808
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:40,436
previewForCancelling item.


809
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:42,746
This looks and works a lot like


810
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:43,686
previewForLifting item.


811
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:45,696
In fact, observe that if we want


812
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:46,946
the QR codes to go back to their


813
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,496
original locations, what we can


814
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:50,096
actually do, similar to what we


815
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:51,786
did in the first example, is


816
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:53,446
take our code that used to live


817
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,176
in previewForLifting item and


818
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:56,916
factor it out into a separate


819
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:57,246
helper.


820
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:58,056
So, we're going to call it


821
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:59,706
dragPreview for item, and what


822
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:03,506
this is going to do is return


823
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:05,256
the original location of the QR


824
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:07,556
codes in both the places where


825
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:09,736
we are lifting and when we are


826
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:10,236
cancelling.


827
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,646
So, I'm going to call that


828
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:14,576
helper in these two places


829
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:18,176
really fast, and rerun the


830
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:18,656
application.


831
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,656
Alright. Now, let's see what


832
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:23,466
happens when I cancel.


833
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:25,566
And, see that they fly back to


834
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:26,876
their original locations and


835
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:27,576
then settle down.


836
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:29,346
So, that looks so much better


837
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,856
than it did before, but there's


838
00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:31,806
one more thing I'd like to show


839
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:31,996
you.


840
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:35,246
So, we're going to hop on over


841
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:36,536
to the right side, where we have


842
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:38,966
Photos, and you can notice that,


843
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,706
as I drag some images, we'll


844
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:41,796
fade out the background of the


845
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,536
image views to kind of indicate


846
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,806
that we are currently dragging


847
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:45,926
an image from that view.


848
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,826
There are a lot of apps around


849
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,336
the system that do this, and we


850
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:50,586
can certainly get the same


851
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,166
effect in our own demo app.


852
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:53,796
So, I'll show you how.


853
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,956
What we're going to do is


854
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:58,036
implement a few alongside


855
00:22:58,036 --> 00:22:58,716
animations.


856
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:00,826
So, as we animate the lift, we


857
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:02,206
get this animator object that


858
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:03,686
we're able to attach alongside


859
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:04,466
animations on.


860
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,646
So, we're going to add this new


861
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:07,396
block that sets our alpha to


862
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:10,056
0.5, our alpha being the alpha


863
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,466
of the overall image view.


864
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,796
So, we're going to fade out the


865
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:13,666
image view as the lift is


866
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,406
happening, and as the lift is


867
00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:16,736
canceling, I'm sorry, as the


868
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,396
drag preview is canceling, we


869
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,656
are going to revert the alpha to


870
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:20,576
1, so we're going to fade the


871
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,436
view back in.


872
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:23,266
Now, it would be kind of a shame


873
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:25,486
if our alpha were permanently


874
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:27,966
ghosted at 0.5, so when the drag


875
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,756
session ends, we've got to be


876
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,326
careful and set our alpha back


877
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,216
to 1, to make sure that we're at


878
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:34,506
full opacity when the drag


879
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,086
finishes.


880
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,806
So, with those changes, I've


881
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,056
rerun the app, and now watch


882
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:42,956
what happens when I begin the


883
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:43,196
lift.


884
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,326
You can see, this nicely


885
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:46,976
indicates exactly where the QR


886
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:48,556
codes are by fading out the rest


887
00:23:48,556 --> 00:23:51,136
of the image view, and as I


888
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:52,786
cancel, you notice that the rest


889
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:54,146
of the image view fades back in


890
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:55,066
just as nicely.


891
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:57,026
So, that's all good and


892
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:57,496
polished.


893
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:58,796
Let's look at our third example.


894
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:00,776
This is Draggable Location Image


895
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:03,226
View, and in here, the trick is


896
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:06,406
that we're adding not only the


897
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,506
image as a representation to the


898
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:09,656
item providers when we start a


899
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,646
drag, but we are also adding the


900
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:12,296
location.


901
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:15,106
What that means is that I'm able


902
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:16,416
to drop into an application that


903
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,206
accepts location, such as Maps,


904
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:20,146
at it will actually navigate me


905
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:21,896
and drop a pin at the location


906
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,236
where this photo was taken,


907
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:24,516
which is, of course, the Golden


908
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:25,016
Gate Bridge.


909
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:26,506
So, that looks pretty good,


910
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:27,736
except for one thing.


911
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:29,946
Now, when I begin a drag, I


912
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:31,106
haven't done any customization


913
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,986
around the drag preview, and so


914
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,456
this default drag preview, which


915
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:35,356
is the entire image view,


916
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:36,936
doesn't do a really good job of


917
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:37,916
really highlighting the fact


918
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,956
that we have a location, and not


919
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:40,686
just an image.


920
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:41,556
It looks just like we're


921
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:42,636
dragging an image right now.


922
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:44,416
So, let's fix that.


923
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:45,836
Now, we're going to go into


924
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:47,006
Draggable Location Image View.


925
00:24:47,006 --> 00:24:48,356
This is where our logic is going


926
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,776
to live, and we're going to


927
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:51,146
implement sessionWillBegin.


928
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:53,376
So, what do we want to do when


929
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:54,376
the session is about to begin?


930
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:56,536
We're going to take our drag


931
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,676
item that we've created, and


932
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,556
we're going to set the


933
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,116
previewProvider property to a


934
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:00,756
new block.


935
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:02,446
Now, in this block, what we're


936
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:03,696
going to do is create a new


937
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:04,576
LocationPlatterView.


938
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:05,596
This is just a custom view I


939
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:06,926
wrote that knows how to


940
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:08,466
represent both an image, as well


941
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,226
as some text describing the


942
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:11,156
location of the image.


943
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:13,366
And, we're going to create a new


944
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,986
UIDragPreview using this


945
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:15,616
information.


946
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:20,346
OK. So, with that change, we


947
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:21,636
should be able to see a much


948
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:24,136
nicer, hotter representation for


949
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:24,816
our drag preview.


950
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:26,746
So, watch what happens when I


951
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:27,356
begin a lift.


952
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,066
Now, interestingly, there's


953
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,726
actually no difference.


954
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:32,886
The reason is because we put our


955
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:34,936
logic into sessionWillBegin, and


956
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,966
the session does not begin until


957
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:38,236
I actually start moving my


958
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:38,586
finger.


959
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:40,546
So now, I'm going to start


960
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:41,876
moving, and look at that.


961
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:43,406
The drag preview has now morphed


962
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:44,966
into this platter representation


963
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,336
that shows both the image.


964

[ Applause ]


965
00:25:50,106 --> 00:25:51,266
That now shows both the image,


966
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:52,646
as well as the location, and as


967
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:53,766
always, I'm able to drop into


968
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:54,136
Maps.


969
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:56,186
It'll navigate me and drop a pin


970
00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:56,346
there.


971
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,236
So, we've discussed a number of


972
00:25:58,296 --> 00:26:00,526
the advanced techniques on the


973
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:01,906
drag interaction side of things.


974
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,446
I would like to now hand it to


975
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:05,026
my other colleague, Tom, to


976
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:06,976
discuss some of the advanced


977
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,416
APIs used to customize drop


978
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,086
interactions.


979
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:15,016
[ Applause ]


980
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:17,756
>> Thanks, Wenson, for finally


981
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:18,756
dragging me into this.


982
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,476
No, I'm happy to be here.


983
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:23,646
So, let's talk about the drop


984
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:23,976
side.


985
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:26,356
Let's take a deep dive into a


986
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:26,616
drop.


987
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:28,636
We're going to talk about drop


988
00:26:28,636 --> 00:26:30,616
sessions first, and that will


989
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,306
bring us to actually performing


990
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:32,736
a drop.


991
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:34,956
So, what is a drop session?


992
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:36,396
It's the other side of a drag


993
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:36,776
session.


994
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:37,766
It gives you access to


995
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:39,266
everything related to a drop.


996
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,536
You can get access to the drag


997
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
location where the user is


998
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,016
dragging inside your view.


999
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,366
It gives you access to the items


1000
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:48,386
in the view, what type of data


1001
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:50,216
is there, and actually their


1002
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,046
data in the end.


1003
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:52,576
It gives you access to the


1004
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:54,376
configuration, so you can act


1005
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:55,116
appropriately.


1006
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:56,986
And finally, it gives you access


1007
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:58,346
to the drag session itself when


1008
00:26:58,346 --> 00:26:59,516
you're dragging locally, but


1009
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:00,586
more about that later.


1010
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:06,016
One thing to keep in mind about


1011
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:08,256
drop interactions is that only


1012
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:09,506
one interaction would handle


1013
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:11,036
only one active drop session at


1014
00:27:11,036 --> 00:27:11,706
the same time.


1015
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:13,336
Why is this?


1016
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:15,376
Because, it would fit most use


1017
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:16,476
case scenarios.


1018
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:18,766
That means that once the user is


1019
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:20,596
dragging around and enters your


1020
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:23,046
interaction, any other session


1021
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:24,286
that comes around and tries to


1022
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,186
enter your interaction won't be


1023
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:26,616
picked up.


1024
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:29,476
Remember, you can drag with more


1025
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:30,436
than one finger at the same


1026
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:30,726
time.


1027
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,826
Now, if you don't want this


1028
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:34,376
behavior, and you do want more


1029
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:35,856
than one session to be active on


1030
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:37,046
your view at the same time,


1031
00:27:37,326 --> 00:27:38,346
there's a few options.


1032
00:27:38,816 --> 00:27:40,236
You can add more interactions,


1033
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:41,336
just add a few more drop


1034
00:27:41,336 --> 00:27:42,386
interactions, and they will all


1035
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:43,636
be handled at the same time.


1036
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,846
They can have the same logic, or


1037
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:46,936
they can have different logic.


1038
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:47,616
Doesn't really matter.


1039
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:49,456
Or, there's a property you can


1040
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:50,766
set on the interaction called


1041
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,666
allowSimultaneousDropSessions.


1042
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:54,356
Set it to true, and that will


1043
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:56,166
lift the block on only one


1044
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,826
session, and you can handle more


1045
00:27:57,826 --> 00:27:58,926
than one session at the same


1046
00:27:58,926 --> 00:27:59,176
time.


1047
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,256
But, your delegate has to handle


1048
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:01,916
this properly.


1049
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:05,106
Let's talk a bit about how a


1050
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:05,746
drop works.


1051
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,076
We've been over this yesterday


1052
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,286
in the introductory talk, but


1053
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,116
let's gloss over it.


1054
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:10,986
User is dragging something, it's


1055
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,266
approaching your view.


1056
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,836
Before we do anything, we'll


1057
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:16,526
call canHandle session on your


1058
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:18,266
interaction delegate, and that


1059
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:20,466
will trigger, depending on what


1060
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,226
you return here, will allow you


1061
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,546
to handle the session or not.


1062
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,546
If you return false, it will be


1063
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:26,826
as if the view doesn't appear to


1064
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,206
the drop session, and nothing


1065
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:28,576
will happen.


1066
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:30,776
If you return true or do not


1067
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:32,086
implement this, will continue


1068
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,416
and call sessionDidEnter to


1069
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,466
indicate that the drag has


1070
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,736
entered your view.


1071
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:39,146
User then moves their finger


1072
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:39,996
around, and will call


1073
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:42,286
sessionDidUpdate repeatedly, and


1074
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:43,166
you have to return a drop


1075
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:43,866
proposal here.


1076
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:45,856
Now, keep in mind, this will be


1077
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,146
called a lot of times, so try to


1078
00:28:48,146 --> 00:28:49,876
do at least minimal work here.


1079
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:51,636
Don't do too much, because your


1080
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,546
frame rate will suffer and users


1081
00:28:53,546 --> 00:28:54,686
don't like that.


1082
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:57,416
When a user lifts their finger,


1083
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,326
will execute a drop.


1084
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,476
More about that later.


1085
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:01,666
And finally, will call


1086
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,916
sessionDidEnd to indicate that


1087
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,466
the session has ended and your


1088
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:05,836
interaction, by default, is


1089
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:07,646
ready to accept new sessions


1090
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:08,016
again.


1091
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:11,186
Now, let's pretend that the user


1092
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,376
did not lift their finger, and


1093
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:13,936
bring them back.


1094
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:16,826
If they move outside, we'll call


1095
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:18,266
sessionDidExit to indicate that


1096
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,866
the session has left your view.


1097
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:21,536
It does not mean that the


1098
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:22,476
session has ended.


1099
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:24,376
It's still going on, so if the


1100
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,656
user lifts their finger outside


1101
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,886
of your view, we'll call


1102
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,506
sessionDidEnd again to indicate


1103
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:30,696
that the session has actually


1104
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:31,086
ended.


1105
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,016
Now, let's pretend again that


1106
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:35,186
the user did not lift their


1107
00:29:35,186 --> 00:29:36,206
finger, and bring it back,


1108
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:38,806
outside of the view, they bring


1109
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:40,056
it back in again, we'll call


1110
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:42,086
sessionDidEnter again, and start


1111
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:43,616
calling sessionDidUpdate to


1112
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,146
update the session and get a


1113
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:45,826
drop proposal.


1114
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:48,806
Now, pretend that the user has


1115
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:50,666
rested on a place inside your


1116
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,896
view where you cannot accept a


1117
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:52,246
drop.


1118
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:54,206
You'll return an operation


1119
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,586
cancel or forbidden.


1120
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,386
If the user then lifts their


1121
00:29:57,386 --> 00:30:00,596
finger, we'll call sessionDidEnd


1122
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:00,976
right away.


1123
00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:02,076
Nothing happens.


1124
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:03,446
No drop is executed, and we're


1125
00:30:03,446 --> 00:30:06,706
just canceling the drop.


1126
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,086
Let's focus on this drop


1127
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,166
proposal for a second.


1128
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:10,696
I'm not going to talk about the


1129
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:11,906
drop operations that was covered


1130
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:13,196
yesterday in the introductory


1131
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:14,846
talk, but there's two more


1132
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:15,856
properties that might be


1133
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:16,276
interesting.


1134
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,456
First, precision mode.


1135
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,586
If you set precision mode by


1136
00:30:19,856 --> 00:30:22,206
setting isPrecise to true, your


1137
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:25,396
will hit tests inside your view


1138
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,816
slightly above the touch of the


1139
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,246
user.


1140
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:29,586
So, the actual hit test location


1141
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:30,996
inside your view will be not


1142
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,706
under the finger, but slightly


1143
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:33,006
above.


1144
00:30:33,676 --> 00:30:35,216
This allows more precise


1145
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,506
dropping inside your view,


1146
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:37,736
because the user can actually


1147
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,306
see where they are dropping.


1148
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,276
A good example is the Text


1149
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:41,876
controls.


1150
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,666
They use precision mode to show


1151
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,536
with carets where the user will


1152
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:47,166
actually drop the items inside a


1153
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,026
Text view.


1154
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:50,166
You can see it here, that the


1155
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,746
caret is shown slightly above


1156
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:53,196
the touch where the user is


1157
00:30:53,196 --> 00:30:54,096
touching the glass.


1158
00:30:54,596 --> 00:30:55,846
If you would not do this, the


1159
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:57,216
caret will be below the finger,


1160
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:58,306
and it will be very hard to


1161
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,466
precisely drop inside a specific


1162
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:02,306
point in the text.


1163
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:03,876
So, if you do implement


1164
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:06,836
precision mode, please indicate


1165
00:31:06,836 --> 00:31:08,986
some UI at the drop site to


1166
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:10,406
indicate to the user where they


1167
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:12,356
will be dropping this items.


1168
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:14,506
Next up is


1169
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,216
prefersFullSizePreview.


1170
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:18,876
This brings us to preview


1171
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,286
scaling.


1172
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:20,296
As you might have noticed by


1173
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,786
playing around with iOS 11, if


1174
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:24,036
you start to drag something, it


1175
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:24,996
will scale it down.


1176
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:26,366
The system will always scale


1177
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:26,886
things down.


1178
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:28,386
Why do we do this?


1179
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:29,466
Because it doesn't make a lot of


1180
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:30,896
sense to have a big preview


1181
00:31:30,896 --> 00:31:32,346
covering the screen and your UI,


1182
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:33,646
because it's interactive.


1183
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:36,006
If you blocked the screen with a


1184
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,716
preview that's too large, it's


1185
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:39,256
hard to navigate around, so we


1186
00:31:39,256 --> 00:31:42,026
scale those down, but in certain


1187
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,996
cases, it might be interesting


1188
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:45,586
to prefer a full-size preview.


1189
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:47,886
For example, you have a list and


1190
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:49,406
this list you can reorder.


1191
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:50,656
So, you pick something up and


1192
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:51,506
try to drag it up.


1193
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,436
It would not make sense to scale


1194
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:55,956
that whole item down, so you can


1195
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,666
add prefersFullSizePreviews


1196
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:57,876
here.


1197
00:31:58,456 --> 00:31:59,626
There's two ways to do this.


1198
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:00,836
At the drag site, there's drag


1199
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:01,356
interaction


1200
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:03,006
prefersFullSizePreviewsFor


1201
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:03,466
session.


1202
00:32:04,176 --> 00:32:05,566
Return true here, and we'll try


1203
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:07,536
to keep those previews full


1204
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:09,636
size, and at the drop site, you


1205
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,296
can set the flag to true on the


1206
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,096
drop proposal.


1207
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:15,146
Note that this is a preference.


1208
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,616
You can ask to scale, not to


1209
00:32:18,616 --> 00:32:20,366
scale, but we might not always


1210
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:20,866
honor it.


1211
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:22,326
There's certain conditions where


1212
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:23,726
the system will scale down


1213
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:24,216
anyway.


1214
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:27,026
A few of these are flocks.


1215
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:29,106
So, if you add more items to the


1216
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:31,036
drag, we will always scale those


1217
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,846
items down, even if you prefer


1218
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:33,746
full-size scaling.


1219
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:37,316
A single preview, if you are


1220
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:40,066
dragging one item and dragging


1221
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,176
it outside your app, we will


1222
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,896
always scale that down, too.


1223
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:45,396
And finally, once something is


1224
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,836
scaled down, we will never scale


1225
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:47,476
it back up again.


1226
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:48,396
So, keep that in mind.


1227
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:49,846
It's a preference, but not


1228
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:50,906
something set in stone.


1229
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:54,096
Let's go to performing a drop.


1230
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:55,166
When you're ready to perform a


1231
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,746
drop, user lift their finger,


1232
00:32:57,256 --> 00:33:00,286
and we'll have to start loading


1233
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:01,166
the data at this point.


1234
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:03,146
In fact, this is the only moment


1235
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:04,716
in time where you can actually


1236
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,746
request data and allow it to


1237
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:09,886
succeed, because in any other of


1238
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,556
the lifetime calls, if you try


1239
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,966
this, it will always fail.


1240
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:14,666
Only in performDrop you have a


1241
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:15,746
chance of getting data.


1242
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:17,486
There's cooperation required on


1243
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:18,706
the other side, so that's why I


1244
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:19,836
say, "There's only a chance,"


1245
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:21,276
but usually you will get some


1246
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:21,666
data.


1247
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:23,276
These data loads are always


1248
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:24,716
asynchronous, so please don't


1249
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:25,196
block here.


1250
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:26,836
If you block for too long and


1251
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:28,376
you don't know how long this


1252
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:30,886
data will be taking to arrive


1253
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,426
there, will kill your app, and


1254
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:33,416
that's not the best user


1255
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:34,756
experience for our users.


1256
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:35,856
So, don't do this.


1257
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:39,006
Load data in the background will


1258
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:40,856
animate the items down into your


1259
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:42,226
view so the user can see you


1260
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,736
dropped, and then finally, we'll


1261
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:44,996
call concludeDrop to indicate


1262
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:46,186
that the animation is done, and


1263
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:47,696
as far as the user is concerned,


1264
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:48,836
the drop is finished.


1265
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,116
This does not mean that the data


1266
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:53,726
is there yet.


1267
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,356
If you can see, the first call


1268
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:56,456
here is still going on.


1269
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:57,796
But, more about that later.


1270
00:33:58,916 --> 00:33:59,696
How do you load data?


1271
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:02,826
There's a very useful call on


1272
00:34:02,826 --> 00:34:04,626
the session called loadObjects


1273
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,626
of class completion.


1274
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:06,986
It's very good to load


1275
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:07,776
homogeneous data.


1276
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:09,565
If you have only images in the


1277
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:11,596
drag or in the drop, and you


1278
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:12,826
know you can only accept those,


1279
00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:14,886
use URImage as class here, and


1280
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,246
it will give you back a nice


1281
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:17,946
array sorted exactly the same as


1282
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:19,426
the sessions, in the sessions


1283
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:22,596
items array, and we'll give it


1284
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:23,025
right to you.


1285
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:23,906
We'll do the heaving lifting


1286
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,016
behind your back, and you'll get


1287
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:25,806
a nice array back.


1288
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,126
This completion block will be


1289
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:28,726
called on the main queue, so you


1290
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:30,246
can update URI right away.


1291
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:32,806
If you have more mixed data


1292
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:33,826
here, or you wanted some more


1293
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:35,545
control, you can just iterate


1294
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:37,446
over the session items and load


1295
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:38,766
each of them individually, if


1296
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:39,126
you want.


1297
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,266
Use loadObject, or


1298
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,926
loadDataRepresentation, or


1299
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:44,216
loadFileRepresentation on the


1300
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,156
item provider.


1301
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:46,266
It gives you more fine-grained


1302
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:47,356
control over what you want to


1303
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:49,335
load and how, and it even allows


1304
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:51,416
you to load multiple file


1305
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,116
representations for each item,


1306
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:53,876
if you choose to.


1307
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:55,795
Keep in mind that this


1308
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:56,806
completion block will be called


1309
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:59,496
on the background queue, so if


1310
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:00,806
you want to do URI work here,


1311
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:01,876
dispatch to the main queue.


1312
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:04,536
I'm going to hand it over back


1313
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,096
to Wenson to show off how that


1314
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:07,426
actually works in practice.


1315
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:13,546
[ Applause ]


1316
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:14,226
>> Alright.


1317
00:35:14,686 --> 00:35:15,206
Thanks, Tom.


1318
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:17,036
So now, I'd like to introduce


1319
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:18,706
the second part of our demo.


1320
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:21,476
This is the, this is the second


1321
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:22,466
demo app, called Drop


1322
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,136
Destination, and what we'll be


1323
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:25,696
doing here is building a photo


1324
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:26,836
gallery very similar to the


1325
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:28,216
Photos app, where dropping


1326
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:29,956
images will populate this area


1327
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:31,436
with additional Image views.


1328
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,306
So, the idea is that this flow


1329
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:34,816
should work.


1330
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:35,896
I should be able to drop here,


1331
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:37,906
and I should see more Image


1332
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:38,306
views.


1333
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:39,456
Now, of course, that didn't


1334
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,156
happen, so let's go into the


1335
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:42,516
code and see why that's the


1336
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:42,826
case.


1337
00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:44,846
So, this is where most of our


1338
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:45,796
logic is going to live,


1339
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,006
Droppable Image Preview


1340
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:48,736
Controller, and here, you can


1341
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:49,926
see that all we've implemented


1342
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:50,846
is sessionDidUpdate.


1343
00:35:51,546 --> 00:35:52,796
So, it's no wonder that the drop


1344
00:35:52,796 --> 00:35:53,936
doesn't work, because we haven't


1345
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,416
actually implemented any drop


1346
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:55,966
handling yet.


1347
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:57,306
I'm going to implement


1348
00:35:57,306 --> 00:35:59,306
performDrop right here, and in


1349
00:35:59,556 --> 00:36:01,346
this method, we are going to


1350
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:02,886
iterate through all of our items


1351
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:03,326
in the session.


1352
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:05,126
Now, for each item, if we are


1353
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:06,916
able to load a UI image, we're


1354
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,206
going to go ahead and insert a


1355
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:09,296
new Image view into our


1356
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:11,426
hierarchy and kick off a load


1357
00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:12,286
from the itemProvider.


1358
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:13,906
Now, when the itemProvider is


1359
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:14,786
done loading, we're going to


1360
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,356
call back to the main queue and


1361
00:36:16,356 --> 00:36:17,826
set the image of the Image view


1362
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:19,526
that we just inserted to this


1363
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:20,606
new image returned by the


1364
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:21,386
itemProvider.


1365
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:23,986
So, with that little change, we


1366
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:25,966
should be able to get this flow,


1367
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:27,146
this basic flow to work.


1368
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:31,196
So, let's see what happens.


1369
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:33,306
Now, the first thing you'll


1370
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:34,296
notice is that now there's a


1371
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:35,466
green plus-three badge.


1372
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:36,596
This indicates that there is


1373
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:37,806
indeed an action to be


1374
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:39,486
performed, and that action, of


1375
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:41,656
course, is inserting new images.


1376
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:42,916
So, that works.


1377
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:44,286
It's very basic, though.


1378
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,476
There is now another feature I'd


1379
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:47,706
like to highlight while we're


1380
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:48,066
here.


1381
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:49,776
So, you might have noticed this


1382
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,946
area at the bottom that says


1383
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:52,546
Drop here to delete photos.


1384
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:54,366
It does what it says on the tin.


1385
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:56,326
When I drop it here, we remove


1386
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:57,226
it from the top area.


1387
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:58,886
So, that's kind of nice, but the


1388
00:36:58,886 --> 00:36:59,956
thing is, we haven't done any


1389
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,386
customization around the drop


1390
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,976
preview yet, and so by default,


1391
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:04,666
images just kind of fly towards


1392
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:05,706
the center and fade out.


1393
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,456
I'm going to now hand it back to


1394
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,376
Tom to see what we can do to


1395
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:09,976
make this better.


1396
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:15,546
[ Applause ]


1397
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:16,786
>> Turns out, you don't need a


1398
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:18,776
lot of codes to perform a drop.


1399
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:20,776
So, let's talk about drop


1400
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:22,426
previews and their animations.


1401
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:25,356
Let's bring back this diagram,


1402
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:28,096
but it turns out that it's a bit


1403
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:29,986
more of a simplification, and


1404
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:30,836
there's more going on.


1405
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:31,836
So, let's bring this


1406
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:33,626
concludeDrop to the side, and


1407
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,096
let's talk about what's going on


1408
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:35,646
in between.


1409
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:37,936
Started loading our data, and


1410
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,026
once we've performed our


1411
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:42,436
completes, we ask you for a


1412
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:44,056
preview for dropping the item by


1413
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,476
calling previewForDropping item


1414
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:46,906
with defaultPreview, giving you


1415
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:47,736
a default preview.


1416
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:49,526
You can return a new preview


1417
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:51,746
here, or return the default


1418
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,146
preview, or nil, whatever you


1419
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:53,526
want.


1420
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:54,796
More about that later.


1421
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:58,056
So, any of the previews we get,


1422
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:00,046
or the defaults we have, we'll


1423
00:38:00,046 --> 00:38:01,836
use these and animate those down


1424
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:03,846
into your view, so the user can


1425
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:04,926
actually see something dropping.


1426
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,056
While that's going on, we'll


1427
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,806
animate willDropWith animator so


1428
00:38:09,806 --> 00:38:11,216
you can animate alongside.


1429
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:13,746
Now, as Robb mentioned before,


1430
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,096
same as in the lift side, the


1431
00:38:16,096 --> 00:38:17,296
drop side is live, too.


1432
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:19,586
While you're dragging, there is


1433
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:20,706
a snapshot, but while you're


1434
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:21,956
dropping or canceling or


1435
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:23,536
lifting, the view is live, so


1436
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:25,066
you can also update the view you


1437
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,036
give us here, or animate


1438
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,526
alongside any other UI you have.


1439
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,556
Those animations finish, and


1440
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:34,826
we'll call concludeDrop to


1441
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:36,826
indicate to you that the drop is


1442
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:38,496
finished and, as far as the user


1443
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:39,956
is concerned, they can continue


1444
00:38:39,956 --> 00:38:40,976
with their business.


1445
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:46,426
Now, again, this does not mean


1446
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:48,076
that the data is already there.


1447
00:38:48,516 --> 00:38:49,846
You can see here, and that's


1448
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,746
just two examples, there's one


1449
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,086
very long load object call


1450
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:54,186
that's going on beyond


1451
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:54,996
concludeDrop.


1452
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:56,796
There's one that, like, ends in


1453
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:58,466
the middle between willAnimate


1454
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,166
and previewForDropping, and even


1455
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,646
the previews are animating at a


1456
00:39:01,646 --> 00:39:02,916
different duration.


1457
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:04,426
That's because, depending on


1458
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,106
what target you give us, they


1459
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:07,656
might take longer to travel


1460
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:07,956
there.


1461
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:09,776
Something that's farther away


1462
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:11,276
from the finger will take a


1463
00:39:11,276 --> 00:39:12,336
little bit longer than something


1464
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:13,546
that's closer to your finger.


1465
00:39:14,136 --> 00:39:15,016
So, keep this in mind.


1466
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,026
The animations do not take the


1467
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:17,586
same time.


1468
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:18,716
They are slightly different.


1469
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:23,866
So, we have drop previews, and


1470
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:25,626
as Wenson already showed, we


1471
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:26,886
also have cancel previews.


1472
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,166
They look almost exactly the


1473
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,506
same, and the same goes for


1474
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:30,406
lifting previews.


1475
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:32,276
It's the same approach, but just


1476
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:33,206
different locations.


1477
00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:36,036
Wenson's previews demos showed


1478
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:37,186
that it's probably better to


1479
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:39,456
implement previewForCanceling


1480
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:40,566
item, because it gives a better


1481
00:39:40,566 --> 00:39:41,496
user experience.


1482
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:43,036
You can fly back the items.


1483
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:45,876
When you update the UI, you can,


1484
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:46,866
I mean, the user can navigate


1485
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,516
around so your original UI can


1486
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,806
be very different than the one


1487
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,476
that you started at, so keep


1488
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:56,176
this in mind.


1489
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:56,886
Additionally,


1490
00:39:56,886 --> 00:39:58,496
willAnimateDropWith animator is


1491
00:39:58,566 --> 00:39:59,376
very similar to


1492
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:00,976
willAnimateCancelWith animator.


1493
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:03,956
And again, different occasions,


1494
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:04,916
but the same approach.


1495
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,476
The UIDragAnimating protocol


1496
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:08,816
here is very similar to


1497
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:10,626
UIViewPropertyAnimator, so


1498
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:12,626
you'll be right at home, there.


1499
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:14,986
Now, let's talk about this


1500
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:15,956
default preview we give you.


1501
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,016
Why do we give it to you?


1502
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:20,636
You could just return it here,


1503
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:21,556
and you get this.


1504
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:25,206
Well, that's fine, but that's


1505
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,086
not why we give it to you.


1506
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:27,726
So, if you do want the default


1507
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:28,816
preview, and you want the


1508
00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:31,086
default animations, just return


1509
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:31,516
nil here.


1510
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:32,806
That indicates to the system


1511
00:40:33,086 --> 00:40:34,036
that you're fine with the


1512
00:40:34,036 --> 00:40:36,066
defaults and the system can do


1513
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,556
what it wants to animate


1514
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:38,776
everything down, and how it


1515
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:39,336
represents it.


1516
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:41,316
So, why do we give you this


1517
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:41,996
default preview?


1518
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:44,426
Well, you can retarget it.


1519
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:46,626
That's why we, what we want you


1520
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:46,896
to do.


1521
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:47,946
If you retarget it, you know


1522
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,106
where it's going to be inside


1523
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:49,506
your view.


1524
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,436
We'll animate it down into the


1525
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:53,516
target you specified, and that's


1526
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,016
a better experience.


1527
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,056
That only works, of course, if


1528
00:40:57,056 --> 00:40:58,266
you know where to target to.


1529
00:40:58,266 --> 00:40:59,466
If you don't know the location,


1530
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:00,656
you can't retarget.


1531
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,446
And finally, you can create your


1532
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:06,646
own custom preview and make your


1533
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:07,176
own UI here.


1534
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,506
You're free to do what you want.


1535
00:41:09,326 --> 00:41:11,336
The preview you give us will


1536
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,416
animate to the target you


1537
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:13,026
specified.


1538
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:15,566
There's a few limits here.


1539
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:16,906
If there's fewer items in the


1540
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,466
flock, then we'll ask you a


1541
00:41:18,466 --> 00:41:20,126
preview for each of the items


1542
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,456
and give you an alongside


1543
00:41:21,456 --> 00:41:23,176
animation for each of the items,


1544
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,836
so depending on how much they


1545
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:27,256
are, you'll get these.


1546
00:41:27,756 --> 00:41:31,416
If there are many items in the


1547
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:33,776
flock, or in the session, then


1548
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:35,426
we'll use the default previews


1549
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,596
for all of them, so we won't ask


1550
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,386
you for preview.


1551
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:40,916
We do give you one alongside


1552
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,976
animation to go with that one


1553
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:44,696
animation for all the items.


1554
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:47,316
Don't take my word for it.


1555
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,046
Wenson's going to show how to do


1556
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:49,976
this.

1558
00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:55,486
>> Thanks again, Tom.


1559
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:58,206
So, to jog your memory, the part


1560
00:41:58,206 --> 00:41:59,776
that we'd like to polish is this


1561
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:00,606
drop animation.


1562
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:02,396
Let's find out how to do that.


1563
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:04,796
So, we're now in Droppable


1564
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:06,616
Delete View, and over here,


1565
00:42:07,106 --> 00:42:08,366
first thing we're going to do is


1566
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:09,726
implement a previewForDropping.


1567
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:12,306
So, given the item, we're going


1568
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:13,446
to create this drag preview


1569
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:13,836
target.


1570
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,656
Now, this looks very similar to


1571
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:17,896
what we've done before, only


1572
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:19,166
this time, we have an explicit


1573
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,316
transform set, so what this is


1574
00:42:21,316 --> 00:42:22,956
going to do is animate our


1575
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:24,496
default preview's width and


1576
00:42:24,496 --> 00:42:26,546
height to 10% of its original


1577
00:42:26,546 --> 00:42:26,936
value.


1578
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:28,366
So, you're going to specify that


1579
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:28,846
transform.


1580
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:29,826
We're also going to set the


1581
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:31,506
center to the be the iconView


1582
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:31,806
center.


1583
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:33,656
The iconView is, if you go back


1584
00:42:33,656 --> 00:42:35,336
to the app, this little trash


1585
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,056
can at the very bottom, here, on


1586
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:37,466
the left.


1587
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:39,866
So, we're going to animate to


1588
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,256
there, and we're going to


1589
00:42:41,256 --> 00:42:42,966
retarget the default preview to


1590
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:44,516
that location using this target.


1591
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:46,296
But wait, there's more.


1592
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:49,486
We can actually do a little more


1593
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,006
polish here.


1594
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:52,026
Let's add an alongside animation


1595
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:53,016
on the drop, as well.


1596
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:55,686
So, let's add a transform to the


1597
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:57,766
iconView to the trash can as the


1598
00:42:57,766 --> 00:42:59,076
drop is taking place.


1599
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,106
So, we're going to transform it


1600
00:43:00,146 --> 00:43:01,986
to 1.25 scale.


1601
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:03,176
That's going to make it grow


1602
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:04,676
slightly, by 25%.


1603
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:06,836
Now, we don't want to have it


1604
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:09,746
permanently at 125% size, so


1605
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:10,886
we're going to set the transform


1606
00:43:10,886 --> 00:43:12,316
back to the identity when we


1607
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:13,646
conclude the drop.


1608
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:16,566
So, with these little tweaks,


1609
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:18,656
should be able to see a little


1610
00:43:18,656 --> 00:43:20,006
more polished experience.


1611
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:23,216
I'm going to go back and drag


1612
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:23,826
some photos here.


1613
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:25,386
So, pay attention to what


1614
00:43:25,386 --> 00:43:26,916
happens to the photo when I drop


1615
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:27,026
it.


1616
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:29,276
You see, this time it goes into


1617
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:30,736
the trash can and disappears.


1618
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,416
And, speaking of the trash can,


1619
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:34,326
you also see that kind of grow


1620
00:43:34,326 --> 00:43:36,306
in size and then shrink when the


1621
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:37,256
drop is concluded.


1622
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:39,376
So, that looks a lot better than


1623
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:39,996
it did before.


1624
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:40,176

00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:45,816
So, I'd like to now show you


1627
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:47,076
something that might not look as


1628
00:43:47,076 --> 00:43:47,266
good.


1629
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:50,396

last panel of Drag Source.

Views.


1633
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:55,106
Now, they're called slow because


1634
00:43:55,106 --> 00:43:56,446
they're stimulating items coming


1635
00:43:56,446 --> 00:43:58,726
in from a remote server far, far


1636
00:43:58,726 --> 00:43:59,006
away.


1637
00:44:00,176 --> 00:44:01,876
If I drop these four photos into


1638
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:03,346
here, it's going to take a


1639
00:44:03,346 --> 00:44:04,656
really long time to load.


1640
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:07,296

But, as is the theme of this


1645
00:44:13,566 --> 00:44:15,286

1646
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:16,116
customized away.

clearly see that there's not one


1662

line here that's equally in

00:44:49,846 --> 00:44:51,206
different time, and the preview

00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:23,316
That's a real-life use case.


1682
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:26,776
So, you saw this Cancel button,


1683
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:28,666
because we don't want to user to


1684
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:29,586
be waiting forever.


1685
00:45:29,766 --> 00:45:31,306
We don't know how long the data


1686
00:45:31,306 --> 00:45:32,556
will take to arrive.


1687
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:34,446
Might be two seconds, might be


1688
00:45:34,446 --> 00:45:35,056
two minutes.


1689
00:45:35,056 --> 00:45:36,586
So, we give the user a way to


1690
00:45:36,586 --> 00:45:37,056
cancel.


1691
00:45:37,426 --> 00:45:38,946
If that happens, we'll call the


1692
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:40,746
completion blocks with nil data


1693
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:41,996
and an error set so you can


1694
00:45:41,996 --> 00:45:43,346
detect this.


1695
00:45:43,946 --> 00:45:46,246
Additionally, both sessions and


1696
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:47,346
item providers provide


1697
00:45:47,466 --> 00:45:48,326
ProgressReporting.


1698
00:45:48,326 --> 00:45:48,816
The session is


1699
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:49,996
ProgressReporting, so you can


1700
00:45:50,196 --> 00:45:51,346
observe its progress.


1701
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:53,346
And, the item provider load


1702
00:45:53,346 --> 00:45:55,596
methods all return a progress


1703
00:45:55,596 --> 00:45:57,366
object you can also use.


1704
00:45:59,516 --> 00:46:00,876
Progress has a cancellation


1705
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,576
handler which is a perfect spot


1706
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:03,776
to handle the cancel.


1707
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:06,266
Add you code there to handle any


1708
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,306
of the items coming in and not


1709
00:46:08,306 --> 00:46:09,696
being there, and you can remove


1710
00:46:09,696 --> 00:46:11,656
them again from your modal.


1711
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:14,916
Now, this also brings us to


1712
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:16,246
showing custom progress, like


1713
00:46:16,246 --> 00:46:17,406
Wenson said before.


1714
00:46:17,616 --> 00:46:19,996
If you don't want this app modal


1715
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:21,386
UI, you can turn it off by


1716
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:22,086
setting session


1717
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:23,686
progressIndicatorStyle to none,


1718
00:46:23,686 --> 00:46:25,566
and then we won't show the UI at


1719
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:26,286
all.


1720
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,406
Now, this does mean you have to


1721
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:29,786
provide that experience to the


1722
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,916
user, yourself.


1723
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:32,466
You can do this by observing the


1724
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:33,296
progress again.


1725
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:34,186
There's a progress on the


1726
00:46:34,186 --> 00:46:35,786
session, and the per-item


1727
00:46:35,786 --> 00:46:36,966
progress returned by the item


1728
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:37,616
providers.


1729
00:46:38,406 --> 00:46:39,636
If you do this, use this


1730
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:41,296
progress to indicate some UI


1731
00:46:41,296 --> 00:46:43,906
there where the user is, where


1732
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:45,986
you can see, for each item, if


1733
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:47,706
it's loading or, in general, for


1734
00:46:47,706 --> 00:46:49,406
your view, but please allow the


1735
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,256
user to cancel or navigate away,


1736
00:46:51,256 --> 00:46:53,026
so they are not blocked on using


1737
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:53,416
your view.


1738
00:46:53,946 --> 00:46:57,466
But, the big question remains,


1739
00:46:57,466 --> 00:46:59,126
how do I generate a preview if I


1740
00:46:59,126 --> 00:46:59,856
don't have any data?


1741
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:01,186
I want to create this custom


1742
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:02,306
preview, but it doesn't work.


1743
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,256
Well, turns out, you can't.


1744
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:05,786
If there's no data, you cannot


1745
00:47:06,986 --> 00:47:07,736
create a new one.


1746
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:10,126
Just use the default previews.


1747
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:11,076
They're a pretty accurate


1748
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:12,366
representation of what's


1749
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:13,396
actually in the item.


1750
00:47:14,346 --> 00:47:16,256
Was set by the drag side, and so


1751
00:47:16,256 --> 00:47:17,636
you can actually use this to


1752
00:47:17,636 --> 00:47:18,396
animate this down.


1753
00:47:19,026 --> 00:47:21,446
We target it, add a transform,


1754
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:22,936
you can change however you want


1755
00:47:23,556 --> 00:47:23,626
it.


1756
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:27,836
You can also make a placeholder


1757
00:47:27,996 --> 00:47:28,686
progress view.


1758
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:30,516
If you have something that you


1759
00:47:30,516 --> 00:47:32,386
want to show, and like, show a


1760
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:34,226
spinner there, that's probably a


1761
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,406
good idea, if it makes sense for


1762
00:47:36,406 --> 00:47:36,626
your UI.


1763
00:47:36,626 --> 00:47:39,126
One of the great things is that


1764
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:40,556
Collection view and Table view


1765
00:47:40,556 --> 00:47:42,086
have built-in support for this,


1766
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:43,656
so you don't have to worry about


1767
00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:43,756
it.


1768
00:47:43,756 --> 00:47:45,736
It's very easy to turn on.


1769
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:48,716
So, I know it's early, tomorrow


1770
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:51,766
at 9 a.m., fourth day of WWDC,


1771
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:53,116
but please come to this session.


1772
00:47:53,116 --> 00:47:56,066
It will be worth your time.


1773
00:47:56,286 --> 00:47:57,816
So, never assume the data will


1774
00:47:57,816 --> 00:47:58,396
be there.


1775
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:00,616
That's the one advice I can give


1776
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:00,846
you.


1777
00:48:01,686 --> 00:48:03,406
Even if you are testing, and


1778
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,186
locally it might be, the data


1779
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,486
might be there right away, this


1780
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:08,836
might not be the case for your


1781
00:48:08,836 --> 00:48:09,416
users.


1782
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,766
You don't know how it's going to


1783
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:11,556
be in the field.


1784
00:48:12,796 --> 00:48:13,886
And, always account for the


1785
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:14,656
worst case.


1786
00:48:15,146 --> 00:48:16,196
That's the best approach you can


1787
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:17,736
take, even if it goes fast, does


1788
00:48:17,736 --> 00:48:19,266
good, but assume that it's going


1789
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:20,336
to take a while.


1790
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:23,236
If implemented properly, this


1791
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:24,976
could look like this.


1792
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:35,856
Custom preview, custom progress


1793
00:48:35,856 --> 00:48:37,706
here, so your user is not


1794
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:37,966
blocked.


1795
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:41,566
Finally, let's talk about how to


1796
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:43,556
improve your in-app experience


1797
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:45,056
by adding drag and drop.


1798
00:48:45,366 --> 00:48:46,216
Drag and drop is something you


1799
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:48,946
can use, to use between apps,


1800
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,496
but you can also use it to


1801
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:51,426
enhance your own app.


1802
00:48:52,216 --> 00:48:53,886
There's a few nice things we


1803
00:48:53,886 --> 00:48:55,736
added to accommodate that.


1804
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:57,476
First is localDragSession on


1805
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,466
UIDropSession.


1806
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:00,086
This gives you access to the


1807
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:01,176
drag session, as I mentioned


1808
00:49:01,176 --> 00:49:01,876
before.


1809
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:04,536
You can access any kind of data


1810
00:49:04,536 --> 00:49:05,276
in the drag session.


1811
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,856
The items again, any stages that


1812
00:49:07,856 --> 00:49:08,956
are, is available.


1813
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:11,736
It only works for in-drag apps.


1814
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:13,006
If you're dragging outside your


1815
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:14,296
app, the drop session will not


1816
00:49:14,296 --> 00:49:16,076
have corresponding local drag


1817
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:18,396
session.


1818
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,806
Additionally, as Robb showed


1819
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:21,256
before, there's localObject on


1820
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:22,036
UIDragItem.


1821
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:25,646
It's a very good container for


1822
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:26,446
local data.


1823
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,556
You can use it to have states,


1824
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:30,286
set some states in


1825
00:49:30,286 --> 00:49:32,456
itemsForBeginning session, and


1826
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:34,056
use that state to generate a


1827
00:49:34,056 --> 00:49:35,306
lift preview, for example.


1828
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:37,316
Or, you can use it to transfer


1829
00:49:37,316 --> 00:49:38,826
data from the drag site to the


1830
00:49:38,826 --> 00:49:39,316
drop site.


1831
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:41,396
That's much easier than building


1832
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:43,276
itemProviders that will transfer


1833
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:44,586
your data outside your app.


1834
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:46,506
If you do allow the drag to go


1835
00:49:46,506 --> 00:49:47,716
outside your app, you still have


1836
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:48,646
to do that, of course.


1837
00:49:49,176 --> 00:49:51,296
And finally, there's


1838
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:52,956
localContext for UIDragSession


1839
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:55,646
which allows you to keep states


1840
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:57,046
for that drag session and the


1841
00:49:57,046 --> 00:49:58,526
drop session, of course,


1842
00:49:59,586 --> 00:50:01,276
locally, without resorting to


1843
00:50:01,276 --> 00:50:04,086
app global states, and it makes


1844
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:05,396
things a bit easier for you.


1845
00:50:08,496 --> 00:50:10,276
How do you keep a drag inside


1846
00:50:10,276 --> 00:50:10,576
your app?


1847
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:12,266
There's a method you have to


1848
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:14,316
implement on the dragInteraction


1849
00:50:14,316 --> 00:50:15,176
delegate called


1850
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:16,216
sessionIsRestrictedTo


1851
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:17,296
DraggingApplication.


1852
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:19,466
If you return true here, then


1853
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:20,826
the drag won't be able to leave


1854
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:21,176
your app.


1855
00:50:21,346 --> 00:50:23,076
The user will still be able to


1856
00:50:23,466 --> 00:50:24,526
drag outside your app, of


1857
00:50:24,526 --> 00:50:26,336
course, but any of the drop


1858
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:28,116
sessions outside your app will


1859
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:30,006
not see the drag.


1860
00:50:30,286 --> 00:50:32,396
So, visually, it will look the


1861
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,886
same, but nothing will be able


1862
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:35,546
to accept it, only inside your


1863
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:35,756
app.


1864
00:50:35,896 --> 00:50:38,076
You can also inspect this on the


1865
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,326
drag and the drop session, if


1866
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:40,356
you want to.


1867
00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:45,196
One last thing, local drag and


1868
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:46,866
drop for iPhone, this is


1869
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:47,896
disabled by default.


1870
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:50,206
On iPad, it's enabled by


1871
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:50,616
default.


1872
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:53,496
This is because you want your


1873
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:56,066
apps to behave according to size


1874
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:57,586
class so that if you have a side


1875
00:50:57,586 --> 00:50:59,136
app, that works, too, but still,


1876
00:50:59,136 --> 00:51:00,346
on the iPad, you can drag out


1877
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:02,546
into another app, but an app of


1878
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:04,396
the same size will not work on


1879
00:51:04,486 --> 00:51:04,886
iPhone.


1880
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,756
So, if you do go on to enable


1881
00:51:06,756 --> 00:51:08,006
drag and drop inside your app


1882
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:09,686
also on the phone, you have to


1883
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:11,786
enable it by setting isEnabled


1884
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:14,176
on the drag interaction to true.


1885
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:16,276
That will enable the


1886
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:17,666
interaction, even on the phone.


1887
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:21,446
I'm going to hand it over to


1888
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:22,676
Wenson for a final demo.

[ Applause ]


1890
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:29,396
>> Thanks again, Tom.


1891
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:30,866
So now, we're going to put


1892
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:31,676
together everything we've


1893
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:33,346
learned so far to implement our


1894
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:34,796
own custom progress UI.


1895
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:36,706
Let's just jump right into the


1896
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:37,036
code.


1897
00:51:37,276 --> 00:51:38,556
So, we're going back and


1898
00:51:38,556 --> 00:51:40,046
revisiting Droppable Image Grid


1899
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:40,686
View Controller.


1900
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,226
Now, here's the function that we


1901
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:43,656
implemented earlier for


1902
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:44,676
performDrop.


1903
00:51:44,676 --> 00:51:46,616
We're just going to add a few


1904
00:51:46,616 --> 00:51:47,166
lines here.


1905
00:51:48,286 --> 00:51:49,746
It's going to look something


1906
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,546
like this.


1907
00:51:53,686 --> 00:51:54,906
First of all, we're going to set


1908
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:57,216
the progressIndicatorStyle to


1909
00:51:57,216 --> 00:51:57,536
none.


1910
00:51:57,736 --> 00:51:59,046
This is going to instruct UIKit


1911
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:00,526
to not show the app modal


1912
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:01,036
dialog.


1913
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:03,506
Next, we're going to remember a


1914
00:52:03,506 --> 00:52:05,486
little bit of state for the drag


1915
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:06,566
item that is being dropped.


1916
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,596
Now, the important thing here is


1917
00:52:08,596 --> 00:52:09,566
that we're going to remember the


1918
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,656
view that we are inserting into


1919
00:52:11,656 --> 00:52:13,006
the view hierarchy of the grid,


1920
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:14,796
as well as this progress that's


1921
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:16,546
returned when we load object on


1922
00:52:16,546 --> 00:52:17,176
the item provider.


1923
00:52:17,496 --> 00:52:19,156
This is going to come in handy


1924
00:52:19,256 --> 00:52:20,566
right now when we implement


1925
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:21,566
previewForDropping.


1926
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:24,296
So, the first thing we do here


1927
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:25,486
is we're going to read some


1928
00:52:25,486 --> 00:52:27,566
state out of our item states


1929
00:52:27,566 --> 00:52:28,076
dictionary.


1930
00:52:28,226 --> 00:52:29,406
This is going to describe


1931
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,606
information about the item that


1932
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,516
is being dropped.


1933
00:52:33,056 --> 00:52:34,386
Namely, it will allow us to


1934
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:35,636
create a new progress spinner


1935
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:35,816
view.


1936
00:52:36,306 --> 00:52:37,396
This is a custom view that just


1937
00:52:37,396 --> 00:52:39,826
knows how to represent a spinner


1938
00:52:40,686 --> 00:52:42,026
indicating the progress of a


1939
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:42,316
load.


1940
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,366
So, we'll create this custom


1941
00:52:44,366 --> 00:52:44,986
view right here.


1942
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,316
The rest is very similar to what


1943
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:46,996
you've seen before.


1944
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:48,166
We'll create a target, create a


1945
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,816
drag preview using that target


1946
00:52:50,556 --> 00:52:51,456
and parameters.


1947
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:53,706
So, consider this.


1948
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:55,766
What happens if the image


1949
00:52:55,766 --> 00:52:57,036
actually loads really fast?


1950
00:52:57,176 --> 00:52:59,536
What will happen is, we'll show


1951
00:52:59,536 --> 00:53:00,596
something at their destination


1952
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:02,196
while the drop is still


1953
00:53:02,196 --> 00:53:03,626
animating, so we'll see this


1954
00:53:03,626 --> 00:53:04,626
drop preview flying to the


1955
00:53:04,626 --> 00:53:06,196
destination that already has


1956
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:07,616
content, and the drop preview is


1957
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:08,876
going to show this spinny


1958
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:09,846
loading progress.


1959
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:10,516
It's going to look kind of


1960
00:53:10,516 --> 00:53:10,826
weird.


1961
00:53:11,426 --> 00:53:12,846
So, this will handle that edge


1962
00:53:12,846 --> 00:53:13,916
case right here.


1963
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:15,506
What we're going to do is set


1964
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:16,886
the alpha of our destination


1965
00:53:16,886 --> 00:53:17,806
view to zero, so we're going to


1966
00:53:17,806 --> 00:53:19,096
hide whatever we show at our


1967
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,996
destination while the drop is


1968
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:21,656
taking place.


1969
00:53:22,316 --> 00:53:23,286
Now, when the drop is finished


1970
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:24,296
animating, we're going to set


1971
00:53:24,296 --> 00:53:25,206
the alpha back to one, and


1972
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:26,506
what's going to happen is that


1973
00:53:26,506 --> 00:53:27,286
the drop preview at the


1974
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:29,306
destination will fade away and


1975
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,756
give way to show the actual


1976
00:53:31,756 --> 00:53:32,986
destination view underneath,


1977
00:53:32,986 --> 00:53:34,166
because we set the alpha to one


1978
00:53:34,326 --> 00:53:34,736
this time.


1979
00:53:35,776 --> 00:53:36,536
So, that should take care of


1980
00:53:36,536 --> 00:53:36,756
that.


1981
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:38,386
There's one last bit of


1982
00:53:38,386 --> 00:53:39,536
bookkeeping we should do, and


1983
00:53:40,306 --> 00:53:41,046
that's implementing


1984
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:41,686
concludeDrop.


1985
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,826
Now, when the drop is finished,


1986
00:53:42,826 --> 00:53:43,896
we've just got to do a little


1987
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:45,376
bit of good bookkeeping and


1988
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,796
remove all of the items that are


1989
00:53:47,796 --> 00:53:49,076
no longer relevant in our


1990
00:53:49,076 --> 00:53:50,376
dictionary of item states.


1991
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:52,726
So, that was a lot of, those


1992
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:53,776
were a lot of changes.


1993
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:55,606
Let's see it in action.


1994
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:02,216
So, I'm going to repeat the same


1995
00:54:02,216 --> 00:54:03,656
scenario with Slow Draggable


1996
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:04,206

1997
00:54:04,496 --> 00:54:05,286
Watch what happens.


1998
00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:07,866
This time, we get a different


1999
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,856
progress UI for each drop that


2000
00:54:09,856 --> 00:54:11,236
is happening, each item that is


2001
00:54:11,236 --> 00:54:13,026
being dropped, and that is


2002
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:14,976
really cool, because it allows


2003
00:54:14,976 --> 00:54:16,586
us to do things such as this.


2004
00:54:17,136 --> 00:54:19,476
If I repeat the same procedure,


2005
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:20,816
you can see that I'm able to do


2006
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:21,896
things like scroll the Image


2007
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:23,576
view, sorry, the Grid view, and


2008
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:24,776
also interact with different


2009
00:54:24,776 --> 00:54:27,056
items while the load is


2010
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:27,426
happening.

Anyway, we talked about how drag


2022
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,876
and drop can be a very powerful


2023
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:56,366
and user-driven input-output


2024
00:54:56,366 --> 00:54:57,276
mechanism for your app.

You can animate a lot.


2030
00:55:07,586 --> 00:55:08,866
We talked about how to handle


2031
00:55:08,866 --> 00:55:10,246
asynchronous data, and

00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:11,446

2033

And finally, we mentioned how


2034
00:55:13,356 --> 00:55:14,986
you can use drag and drop even


2035
00:55:14,986 --> 00:55:16,106
inside your app, to make your


2036
00:55:16,106 --> 00:55:17,006
app a lot better.
