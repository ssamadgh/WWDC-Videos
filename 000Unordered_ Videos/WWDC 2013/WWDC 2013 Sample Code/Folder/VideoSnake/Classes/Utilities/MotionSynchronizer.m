 Outputs media samples with synchronized motion samples
 
 The media and motion arrays function like queues, with newer samples toward the end of the array. For each media sample, starting with the oldest, we look for the motion sample with the closest possible timestamp.
 
 We output a media sample in two cases:
 1) The difference between media sample and motion sample timestamps are getting larger, indicating that we've found the closest possible motion sample for a media sample.
 2) The media array has grown too large, in which case we sync with the closest motion sample we've found so far.
