00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:20,526
>> Thanks, Mike.


4
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:21,586
Hello everyone.


5
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:27,236
Design is hard but design


6
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,516
presentations are way harder.


7
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:33,556
I still find them daunting.


8
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:37,476
And today, a presentation about


9
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:39,376
how to present design work at


10
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:40,296
WWDC.


11
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,046
The struggle is real.


12
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,286
In any presentation, we have to


13
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:50,326
take this big and complex topic


14
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,506
and explain it precisely.


15
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,876
Take it right down to its


16
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:55,706
nucleus.


17
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:57,976
And if we don't do that well,


18
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,776
those ideas might die.


19
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:03,596
All that hard work you did


20
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,686
resigned to the depths of your


21
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:06,000
hard drive.


22
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:08,636
Presentation matters.


23
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,146
As a designer at Apple, I have


24
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,616
to present design work all the


25
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:14,006
time.


26
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:17,626
Unfortunately, this year I can't


27
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:19,546
show you too much of that, but


28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,186
I'm going to try and transmit to


29
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,266
you the ten most important


30
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,826
things I've learned about


31
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:27,386
presenting design work in the


32
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,786
next nine minutes or so.


33
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,656
It's going to be punchy.


34
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:33,506
Now when you really think about


35
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:35,726
it, there are three fundamental


36
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:37,346
parts to a presentation.


37
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:41,086
There is me, the presenter, the


38
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:44,356
emotional designer consumed by


39
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:45,966
this problem and the prettiness


40
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:47,976
of it.


41
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:50,136
And there is you, the audience,


42
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:53,146
detectives of design crime,


43
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:55,956
guardians of good sense,


44
00:01:56,756 --> 00:01:58,676
Draculas of deadlines, and


45
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:00,256
captains of code.


46
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,306
And between us, there is this


47
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:04,376
central idea.


48
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,006
The thing we need to agree is


49
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,286
good for our company, good for


50
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:11,266
our customers, something that


51
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,846
makes the world a slightly


52
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:13,776
better place.


53
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:15,766
Let's call it a toaster.


54
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,976
And really a presentation is


55
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,046
just a mechanism to exchange


56
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:24,836
information about that idea, to


57
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:27,126
facilitate decisions and action


58
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,836
one way or another, to make this


59
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:33,906
thing fly or crash right back


60
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,106
down to Earth.


61
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:39,166
So dear presenter, these are the


62
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,886
key things you need to


63
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:41,546
understand.


64
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,396
What are your objectives for


65
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:46,306
this presentation?


66
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:49,756
Clarify your objectives.


67
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,546
Are you trying to get this work


68
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:55,556
approved by your superiors or


69
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:57,136
successfully communicate with


70
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:57,766
engineers?


71
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:00,516
Maybe you're pitching a new


72
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:01,116
idea.


73
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:04,246
Try to imagine what succeeding


74
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:06,286
looks like and work backwards


75
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,256
from there.


76
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:10,456
Identify the questions you need


77
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,666
your audience to help you


78
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,006
answer.


79
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,706
State these and your goals up


80
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:16,096
front.


81
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:20,756
And understand the objectives of


82
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:21,706
your audience.


83
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:23,376
What do they care about?


84
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,986
Remember, your objectives


85
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,146
include addressing theirs.


86
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:33,326
Try not to dive in to details


87
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:36,216
and minutia before you clarify


88
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,036
the bigger picture.


89
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,866
Next is a big one: feedback.


90
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:47,406
As designers, we feel vulnerable


91
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:50,326
and exposed, painting our finest


92
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,276
pictures and teeing them up to


93
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:53,736
be torn to shreds.


94
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,746
Try to entertain the mindset


95
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,496
that there is no failure, only


96
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:00,136
feedback.


97
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:05,116
Take all of it seriously even


98
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:05,936
when you disagree.


99
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:08,826
If you are presenting, you are


100
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:09,626
asking for feedback.


101
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:15,086
It's the whole point and clarify


102
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,406
the problems the audience


103
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,125
identify.


104
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,886
Sometimes people offer solutions


105
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,946
that are unworkable, but the


106
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:23,356
problem they are addressing is


107
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:24,226
totally valid.


108
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,656
So when you have exhausted all


109
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:31,156
possibilities, remember this,


110
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:32,936
you really haven't.


111
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,556
People in your audience will


112
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,156
know things you don't.


113
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,356
So be willing to change your


114
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,366
position, especially when new


115
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,000
information has been presented.


116
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:50,286
Don't pretend to understand


117
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,406
unclear feedback.


118
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:57,446
Clarify the problem this person


119
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:58,666
is trying to address.


120
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:03,006
Don't respond like that.


121
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:04,826
And don't be dismissive or get


122
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,726
overly defensive.


123
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:08,916
It really won't help your case.


124
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,586
Seek advice.


125
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:16,846
Use the wisdom of your


126
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:17,306
colleagues.


127
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,016
Don't be afraid to ask for help.


128
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:22,236
They know how this works.


129
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:23,946
Their input is priceless.


130
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:25,786
Practice with them.


131
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,596
Sense check your deck.


132
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,026
Do a full practice run if it


133
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:30,606
merits it.


134
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,616
Do not deliver it blind.


135
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:34,836
The feedback will make a huge


136
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:35,416
difference.


137
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:39,636
And honestly, don't try to do


138
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:40,756
everything yourself.


139
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:43,546
Teamwork makes the dream work


140
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,536
plus it's really hard to keep


141
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:48,836
track of too many disparate


142
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,076
things as one person, let alone


143
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:53,336
try and explain them to others


144
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:54,856
in a single presentation.


145
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,786
Use your own voice.


146
00:05:58,456 --> 00:05:59,366
Be genuine.


147
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:01,686
Have fun.


148
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:03,476
Make terrible jokes.


149
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:06,926
Quote Bruce Lee.


150
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,056
You wouldn't be giving this


151
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,626
presentation at all if you


152
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:10,816
didn't have the credibility.


153
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:13,626
You've earned it.


154
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:14,986
Express your opinion.


155
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:16,686
You are the expert here.


156
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,536
The audience wants to know what


157
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:20,386
you think and that doesn't mean


158
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,276
you have to have all the


159
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:21,696
answers.


160
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,366
Show your passion.


161
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,496
Why do you care about this?


162
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,796
And explain your process.


163
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,436
Show the journey you've been on.


164
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:34,406
How and why did you reach these


165
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,116
conclusions?


166
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:40,456
Don't be overconfident or


167
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:41,476
insincere.


168
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,956
Sometimes designers can adopt a


169
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:45,386
posture of being super


170
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,426
confident, bordering on arrogant


171
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:48,796
and avoid that.


172
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:50,056
It's just not cool.


173
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,706
And don't say what you think


174
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:53,986
people want to hear.


175
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:56,576
Your vote counts for a lot.


176
00:06:58,606 --> 00:06:59,726
The audience.


177
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,346
It's not a presentation without


178
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:03,086
an audience.


179
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:05,636
Make sure you show them that


180
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:06,226
respect.


181
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:08,686
You need their cooperation to


182
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,076
give life to your ideas.


183
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:12,056
And if you've presented to this


184
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,716
audience before, you'll get --


185
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,396
start to get an idea of what


186
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:17,176
they respond to.


187
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,726
Tailor to them as much as you


188
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,666
can and always have an agenda.


189
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:24,186
Here's what we're going to talk


190
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,686
about in this order.


191
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,276
This is also your chance to


192
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:30,226
assert the point at which you'd


193
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,576
like to field feedback.


194
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:34,156
It almost certainly won't work


195
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:36,286
that way but still do try.


196
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:40,076
And if you've met previously,


197
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:41,566
recap what happened.


198
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:43,636
Like when you're engrossed in a


199
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,706
series but then life happens and


200
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,226
when you pick it up again, you


201
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:48,636
really grateful for that 30


202
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,796
second refresher.


203
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:52,716
Hey, Zach.


204
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,656
Here's a study of the character


205
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:56,666
that you asked for.


206
00:07:58,716 --> 00:07:59,696
Good feedback.


207
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,876
I'm not sure about those emoji


208
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:02,706
either.


209
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,646
Integrate their feedback.


210
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,706
Let them know how it affected


211
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:07,526
your designs.


212
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:10,776
Show that you're listening and


213
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,000
responding.


214
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:16,836
Terrible.


215
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:23,426
Make no assumptions, you know --


216
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,466
people know what things mean or


217
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:27,706
why decisions were made.


218
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,686
You are much further along this


219
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,036
path than your audience.


220
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,956
Anticipate their questions.


221
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,236
Pay attention to their


222
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:34,885
reactions.


223
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,635
And be willing to explain.


224
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:39,976
Do not show up without a plan or


225
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:40,996
try to wing it.


226
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:42,246
It's not a good look.


227
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,866
And also showing your working


228
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:46,636
files, not good.


229
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,136
These things are lazy and


230
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,906
disrespectful of people's time.


231
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,706
And, of course, don't be


232
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,576
dismissive of -- again, don't be


233
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,326
dismissive of anyone's input.


234
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,976
Try to be patient and objective.


235
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,136
Make it relatable to your


236
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:08,706
audience.


237
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:10,436
If not, they may well start to


238
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:11,046
tune out.


239
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,946
Let people see themselves in


240
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:14,706
your story.


241
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,226
If you can elicit an emotional


242
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:19,776
response, excitement, worry, or


243
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:22,656
even fear, it will enhance their


244
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,956
sense of commitment.


245
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:26,986
Ellis goes crazy for that


246
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,006
elderberry jam.


247
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,396
Use what you know about your


248
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,206
audience to your advantage.


249
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,806
Describe what you see and feel.


250
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,256
Don't talk about users like they


251
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:41,136
are a distant third party.


252
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,956
Flow diagrams can be really


253
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:45,726
useful with engineers but when


254
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:47,646
communicating concepts, there's


255
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:48,506
a big disconnect.


256
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,126
Instead, speak in the first


257
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:51,696
person.


258
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:55,196
Here I am at my desk working on


259
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,996
my e-mail and ding, a handy


260
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,446
reminder it's time for


261
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:00,186
breakfast.


262
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,576
I hit the notification and bam,


263
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:05,446
straightaway I can load my toast


264
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:06,986
without even stepping away from


265
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:07,456
my desk.


266
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,296
Just one swipe down and we're


267
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:10,836
toasting.


268
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,626
And a few minutes later I know


269
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,056
to be on my way, perfect timing.


270
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,346
And how cool is that?


271
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:20,716
I can even see my stats.


272
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:23,796
Clearly, this is more powerful


273
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:25,646
if you can demo a prototype.


274
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:29,206
And engage in dialogue.


275
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,346
A presentation should be a


276
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:31,876
dialogue.


277
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,886
Engage with your audience.


278
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,996
Design for the aha moment.


279
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,036
If you can lead people through


280
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,176
your story, their minds will try


281
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:42,346
and predict the ending.


282
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,076
This will keep them engaged.


283
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,446
Ask them questions.


284
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:48,176
Keep them dialed in.


285
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,746
You're here for their feedback


286
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:50,626
after all.


287
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:55,086
Do not deliver a monologue.


288
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,806
This is boring and naive.


289
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:01,476
Think of it as a discussion more


290
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:02,216
than a speech.


291
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,956
And finally, the idea.


292
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:09,736
It is crucial to explain why.


293
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:12,856
Define each problem in a single


294
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:13,656
sentence.


295
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,496
It's a great exercise to really


296
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:16,976
get to the heart of the matter.


297
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,786
You'll need to find agreement on


298
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:21,956
those problem statements with


299
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:22,816
your audience.


300
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,856
Otherwise, you'll be barking up


301
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:25,886
the wrong tree.


302
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,626
Continue to revisit, refine, and


303
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,996
refer back to those statements


304
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:34,266
as you progress and, of course,


305
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,416
where you can, show evidence


306
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,726
that these problems exist.


307
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:39,496
Boom.


308
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,916
Cold, burnt toast.


309
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,166
Tragic problems in this world.


310
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:49,366
Avoid using subjective reasoning


311
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:50,996
for your decisions.


312
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,186
I chose this color because I


313
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:55,176
like it is not remotely


314
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,796
persuasive, especially if your


315
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:58,826
audience don't share your


316
00:11:58,826 --> 00:11:59,566
preferences.


317
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:03,616
And the truth is that people


318
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:04,926
really won't remember your


319
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:05,616
slides.


320
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:07,566
They'll remember how your story


321
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,906
made them feel if it resonated


322
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:13,676
with them so sketch out the


323
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:15,436
narrative of your presentation


324
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:16,206
early.


325
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,636
The most successful designers I


326
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:19,386
know do this.


327
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,126
It's another thing that will


328
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:23,206
help you focus and use your time


329
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,116
effectively.


330
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:27,196
So where you can, incorporate a


331
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,746
story with a distinct beginning,


332
00:12:29,746 --> 00:12:31,546
middle, and an end.


333
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:35,266
People intuitively get stories.


334
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,446
And it'll really help them


335
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:38,426
follow along.


336
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:42,636
Contrast today's reality with a


337
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,416
better future.


338
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:47,446
Nancy Duarte, a master of


339
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:49,606
presentations, discovered in her


340
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:51,006
research that some of the


341
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:52,726
greatest and most effective


342
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,286
presentations follow this


343
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:54,666
structure.


344
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,466
And the key thing here is


345
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:59,076
providing the contrast between


346
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:02,526
what is today's reality and what


347
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:05,236
could be, what the future could


348
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,156
look like if we make the ideas


349
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,616
we're presenting our new


350
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:09,146
reality.


351
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:13,166
Today, people are frustrated,


352
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,326
cold, joyless toast.


353
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:17,486
It's an epidemic.


354
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,766
But imagine happy, flawless


355
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,606
toast at the top of the button


356
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:23,646
on your iPhone.


357
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,416
But don't get too carried away.


358
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:30,786
That is a rookie mistake.


359
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,326
Keep it simple.


360
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,476
The main thing is to keep the


361
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:41,956
main thing the main thing.


362
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:44,556
I love this quote.


363
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,046
And I always find myself coming


364
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:46,526
back to it.


365
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:49,096
It's such a perfect expression.


366
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,726
If I had more time, I would have


367
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,066
written a shorter letter.


368
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:55,466
Relevant not only for


369
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:58,316
presentations and writing


370
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:00,356
e-mails but as a philosophy


371
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,386
toward design.


372
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,436
Don't overload people with too


373
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,526
much information.


374
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:08,166
Strip away everything that isn't


375
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,886
essential to your mission or


376
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:10,586
your message.


377
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:14,116
And finally, don't forget to


378
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:14,956
summarize.


379
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,236
Know your objectives, otherwise


380
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:20,416
what's the point?


381
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,366
Embrace feedback.


382
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:23,696
It's what you're here for.


383
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:26,246
Seek advice.


384
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:28,206
Your colleagues are smart.


385
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:30,496
And use your own voice.


386
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:33,486
It's the best one you have.


387
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:35,376
Respect your audience or they


388
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,706
won't respect you.


389
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:39,416
Make it relatable, otherwise


390
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,336
they'll forget it.


391
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,496
Engage in dialogue to keep them


392
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:47,566
present and explain why.


393
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:48,926
It's the million dollar


394
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:49,446
question.


395
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,786
Utilize storytelling because it


396
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:53,506
works.


397
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:56,226
And keep it simple even though


398
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:56,646
it's not.


399
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,196
Good luck with your


400
00:14:58,196 --> 00:14:58,976
presentations.
