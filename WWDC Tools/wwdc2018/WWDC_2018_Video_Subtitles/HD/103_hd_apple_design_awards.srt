It is great to be back here with

great evening for you.


15
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:52,646
So, thank you for coming out and


16
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:55,036
joining us in this afternoon and

celebration of the winners that


18
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:57,766
we're going to announce, soon.


19
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:00,266
We're here to honor developers


20
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,706
who have done excellent work and


21
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:05,296
with technology adoption, with


22
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:07,066
innovation, making their apps


23
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:07,496
unique.


24
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:11,116
And in my role at Apple and in


25
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:12,426
my team's role at Apple we've


26
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,046
worked with so many of you over


27
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,866
the years, helping you to create


28
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:16,716
great apps.


29
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:20,826
Apps that are engaging and apps


30
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:21,866
that are compelling.


31
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,056
Apps that are high performance


32
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:26,266
and apps that are, honestly,


33
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,116
really great.


34
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,266
And so, it's an honor for me to


35
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:31,756
be here and to be able to lead


36
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:34,126
this award ceremony and honor


37
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:35,706
these developers, tonight.


38
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,726
The work that is done by you, as


39
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,076
the developer committee, speaks


40
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,026
to the heart of Apple.


41
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:44,756
And that heart is, as we all


42
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,376
know, creativity.


43
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,746
In all of its forms, we believe


44
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:52,836
that creativity has always been


45
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,266
humanity's greatest super power.


46
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,476
And when it combines with


47
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:59,886
technology great things come to


48
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:00,326

00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:02,016
Incredible things come to life.

51
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:06,506
that you, as developers, are


52
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:07,776
amazingly creative.


53
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:11,586
Like a paintbrush to an artist,


54
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:15,006
chords to a composer, words to


55
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:17,926
an author, code is an even more


56
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:19,216
advanced creative tool.


57
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,866
Because it can really do and


58
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:23,136
create so much.


59
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:26,926
As developers, you're developing


60
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:28,736

61
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:32,816

62
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:35,086
groundbreaking apps and ideas to


63
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:36,026
take shape.


64
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,006
And each year new and


65
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,366
transformative apps are


66
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,326
introduced bases on those ideas.


67
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,426
And each time this happens you


68
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,116
take creativity to new levels.


69
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:51,436
For example, take a look at the


70
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:53,326

78

80
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:18,166

82
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:22,366
As well as everyday tools that


83
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,636
help you to get things done and


84
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,666
make a, truly make a difference


85
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,256
in this world.


86
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:30,936
The developers of these apps and


87
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,706
so many more over the years have


88
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,406
amazed us with their excellent


89
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:35,126
work.


90
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:38,536
Now, we all understand the


91
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:40,546
incredible hard work that goes


92
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:42,296
into the design and development


93
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,836
of great apps like these and


94
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:44,226

95
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,766
We're all too familiar with the


96
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,056
long nights, long hours,


97
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:52,496
technical hurdles, design


98
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:55,356
challenges, and honestly, often,


99
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:56,606
a really hard to find bugs.


100
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:59,916
But that's why we're here


101
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:00,296
tonight.


102
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:04,506
To honor and celebrate that hard


103
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:05,286

104
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:07,676
Today's winners set a new


105
00:04:07,676 --> 00:04:09,976
benchmark in creativity and they


106
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:11,356
demonstrate the mark of


107
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:13,416
brilliance that makes something


108
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,036
truly great.


109
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:18,315
Okay. We've got something to do


110
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:19,466
here, tonight, which is to give


111
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,646
out a bunch of awards.


112
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:22,406
And we're going to do that in a


113
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:23,536
very large room.


114
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,686
So, if you hear your name


115
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,766
called, if you hear your app's


116
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,946
name called, you need to make it


117
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:30,746
up here fast.


118
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:32,746
Because we want to move this


119
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:34,746
along and it's a big room.


120
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,676
There are two sets of stairs


121
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:37,806
here on either side of me.


122
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:40,086
So, just head towards me, you'll


123
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:41,186
find a set of stairs, you'll


124
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:42,236
make it onto the stage, and


125
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,886
we'll move on from there.


126
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:48,496
So, let's get started.


127
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,206
Identifying the audience for


128
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,916

129
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,426
something that's perfectly


130
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:56,566
suited for them and their needs


131
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:58,116
is really important.


132
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:00,736
The developer of our first


133
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,516

134
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:05,296
perfectly tuned for children and


135
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,936
the way that they learn.


136

Join me in congratulating


137
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:12,286

[ Music ]


139
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,106
All right.


140
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:39,856
So, Bandimal is a fun and


141
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,936
intuitive music composer app.


142
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:44,876
It lets kids explore music and


143
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,546
be the maestro of their own


144
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:47,936
animal band.


145
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,896
And the key to this app is its


146
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:52,366
focus on creativity.


147
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,876
There are no rules, no notes, no


148
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,796
chords, no scores.


149
00:05:58,896 --> 00:05:59,866
Let's take a look.


150
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:00,476
Andrea.


151
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:02,316
>> Thanks, John.


152
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,656
Let's dive right in.


153
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,366
I'll tap on the plus here to


154
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,456
start a new composition.


155
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:08,656
And the music gets started right


156
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:09,216
away,


157
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,660
which we should hear, soon.


158
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:13,666
There we go.


159
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,616
But we're going to need to add


160
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:16,286
some notes.


161
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:19,086
The app has this adorable cast


162
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,816
of animal characters.


163
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:21,986
Each one makes a different


164
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:22,466
sound.


165
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:24,246
I'm going to swipe through them


166
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:25,196
till I find one that I like,


167
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,306
which I guess, I'm going to go


168
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:27,286
with this buffalo, here.


169
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,056
I'll tap down here with my


170
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:31,586
finger to add some notes.


171
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,546
And you can see each note comes


172
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:36,126
with its own special dance move.


173
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:37,216
Now, I'm going to speed up the


174
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:38,716
tempo by turning this dial.


175
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:41,896
And, maybe, after I do that I


176
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,596
decide I want to give my buffalo


177
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:47,566
a nice rest every other beat.


178
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:49,106
There we go.


179
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:52,596
Now, I need a nice lead singer


180
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,056
to complement my buffalo bass,


181
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,756
so I'm going to tap here, swipe


182
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:57,000
through my options.


183
00:06:59,416 --> 00:06:59,976
There we go.


184
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,226
This chicken looks like she'll


185
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:01,836
be a star.


186
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:03,330
Tap down here.


187
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,466
And I'm going to speed up her


188
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:09,716
tempo to match my buffalo bass.


189
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:13,176
And, maybe, I'll do a call and


190
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:16,106
response type thing so they can


191
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,676
interact with each other.


192
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,196
Now, I need one more animal to


193
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:19,646

So, I'm going to tap here.

00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,656
I happen to know there's a

Sounds good.


202
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:39,516
So, as kids create these


203
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:40,686
compositions they're building


204
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:41,746
their sense of rhythm and


205
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,606

206
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:45,086
naturally, without need for any


207
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,096
prior musical knowledge.


208
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:48,766
And the beauty of the app is any


209
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,026
combination of notes is going to


210
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,096
sound good, because it's all


211
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:52,876
playing in pentatonic scale.


212
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,416

natural sounds.


226
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:18,266
I can even add a sound effect by


227
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,176
tapping on these mountains.


228
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:21,486
That's going to give my chicken

236
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,265
And it's a great way for kids to


237
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,806
get creative with music and feel


238
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,976
their ear and their intuition


239
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,456

approach to note taking on the

271
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,216
By combining notes, calendars,


272
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:19,656
and tasks in unique ways and


273
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:20,556
with really powerful

Let me show you what I mean.


287
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:40,676
We start out with On the Agenda.


288
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,996
This is a task manager like


289
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:42,506

290
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,206
I can quickly see my highest


291
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,846
priority items and what I need


292
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,596
to do with all my prior notes


293
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:47,966
attached.


294
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:49,326
I can mark things off as I


295
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:49,836
complete them.


296
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,746
So, now that we're done with


297
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:52,036

298
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,096
And State of the Union.

house renovation, so I need to


301
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,996
remember to call the contractor.


302
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,756
It's super convenient to see all


303
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,516
my prior notes attached before I


304
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,636
make that phone call.


305
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,726
What makes this app really great


306
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:04,656
is its integration with


307
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:05,176
Calendar.


308
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:06,796
So, on the right-hand side here,


309
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,526
you can see all my Calendar


310
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:08,776

311
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:11,106
There's a HealthKit lab tomorrow


312
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,566
and I need to remember to note


313
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:13,466
down a couple of questions.


314
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,386
So, we'll do that together.


315
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:16,816
So, I bring in this note.


316
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:18,686
You can see it brings in all the


317
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:19,776
details from Calendar.


318
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,766
So, the event details, the


319
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,826
location, the attendees.


320
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,186
So, I can focus on creating the


321
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:25,326
note.


322
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:28,326
So, as I create this note, you


323
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:29,946
can see the app supports


324
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:30,546
markdown.


325
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,636
It also supports tagging, which


326
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:34,066
is really nice.


327
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:34,806
So, I'm going to tag this as a


328
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:35,736
HealthKit related note.


329
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:37,646
As I'm making this note, I


330
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,616
realize a colleague and I had a


331
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,686
meeting a couple weeks back,


332
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:41,566
where we brainstormed some


333
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:42,596
HealthKit related questions.


334
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:43,806
So, I'm going to swing over to


335
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,286
Calendar and find that meeting.


336
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:50,046
This meeting with John.


337
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:53,006
Agenda provides this link in the


338
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,756
Calendar in my, so as I click on


339
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,056
this it clicks me right back


340
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:57,966
into this meeting with John.


341
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,666
And here are the questions that


342
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,586
I wanted.


343
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:03,296
So, you can imagine after using


344
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,656
this for a couple weeks, you end


345
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:06,546
up with this really great

00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:08,226

organized.


350
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:15,036
Lastly, because I know I'm going


351
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:16,816
to be doing a lot of HealthKit


352
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,506

353
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,636

355
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,146
And I can save this as an


356
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:23,676
overview.


357
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:24,876
And what this does, it creates


358
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:25,976
this nice little pocket here,


359
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:26,896
where everything HealthKit


360
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:27,976

361
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:29,226
Super convenient.


362
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:31,826
The entire app is created in


363
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,566
Swift and it leverages iCloud,


364
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,236
so it syncs across all of my


365
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:35,726

366
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,566
Agenda is not simply a place to

00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,636

reinforces great note taking

[ Music ]


388
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,496
This is an app that we fell in


389
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,376
love with, just like we did with


390
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,266
its predecessor.


391
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,266
Snowman and Team Alto have done


392
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,006
an incredible job of taking what


393
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:10,216
people love from Alto's


394
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,386
Adventure and improving on it in


395
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:14,296
every way for Odyssey.


396
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:15,856
And I'd like to ask my


397
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,796
colleagues, Adrienne and Jordan,


398
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:18,976
to show it to us, now.


399
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:25,956
>> Thanks, John.


400
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,446
Alto's Odyssey is an endless


401
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,326
sandboarding game, where you


402
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,656
ride through sunswept dunes,


403
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,046
perform midair stunts, all while


404
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:37,966
completing fun challenges and


405
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:39,246
unlocking new characters.


406
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:40,966
So, my colleague Adrienne will


407
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:41,946
be joining us for the demo,


408
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:42,316
today.


409
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:43,416
So, let's get started.


410
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,806
The first thing that we loved


411
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,646
about Alto's Odyssey was that it


412
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:49,756
provides the user with


413
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,436
contextual clues and elegantly


414
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:54,516
pauses the game, so the player


415
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:56,436
learns by playing.


416
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:57,576
So, here she's getting taught


417
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:58,976
how to perform a wall ride,


418
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,016
which is a new feature in the


419
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:00,106
game.


420
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:02,716
There are no carousels that


421
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:03,966
she's swiping through.


422
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:05,996
It's just her and the game.


423
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:08,536
We, also, love that it maintains


424
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:10,406
that same simple control scheme


425
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,316
for Alto's Adventure but ramps


426
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:13,666
up the difficulty with new


427
00:15:13,756 --> 00:15:14,216
challenges.


428
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,816
Control-wise, all Adrienne is


429
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,776
doing is tapping to jump, and


430
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,046
then tapping and holding to


431
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,116
perform some epic flips.


432
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,416
Now, Alto's Odyssey is a real


433
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,956
feast for the senses.


434
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:29,476
Visually, there's so much to


435
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:30,476
look at in this game.


436
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,116
There is elements in the


437
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:33,256
foreground, in the background


438
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,676
like hot air balloons, sand


439
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:36,546
coming off the back of the


440
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:36,976
board.


441
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,706
But each level has such a


442
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,336
striking color palette to it


443
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:42,866
that we fell in love with.


444
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:45,236
That same attention to detail,


445
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,086
also, carries over into the


446
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:47,896
audio, as well.


447
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:49,426
So, actually, let's take a


448
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:50,326
listen to that, right now.

450
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,556
Ah. Again, we love this.


451
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:03,346
And you can, actually, listen to


452
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:04,506
it, too, because it's available


453
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,286
on iTunes and Apple Music.


454
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:09,316
We, also, fell in love with how


455
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,166
it uses the haptic engine on our


456
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,356
devices.


457
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,076
So, Adrienne is getting a slight


458
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:16,036
vibration on the iPhone when


459
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:17,696
she's, when she's landing a


460
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:20,316
jump, performing a wall ride, or


461
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:21,826
even, bouncing off of hot air


462
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:23,356
balloons in the game.


463
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:25,696
It, also, maintains a super


464
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:28,306
smooth 60 frames per second on

00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:30,586
every device, including previous

00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:31,526
generation devices.


467
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,696
In large part, thanks to Metal 2


468
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:34,426
and Unity.


469
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,696
And it even maintains that same


470
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:39,296
simple control scheme across

00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:42,266

472
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:46,796

choice is really important.

Now, as you can see, the whole


540
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,406

00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,586
further by implementing 3D touch


544

00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:17,646
doing a great job demoing today,


767
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:19,036
we're going to take a look at


768
00:28:19,236 --> 00:28:21,436
another scene.


769
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:24,026
Florence has a custom composed


770
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:26,986
soundtrack and it's incredible.


771
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:29,636
Music plays a huge part


772
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:30,436
throughout the entire


773
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:31,686
experience.


774
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:34,466
And this is when you hear music


775
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:35,996
and you decide to tap the notes


776
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:37,246
to follow it.


777
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,656
And you know how music can make


778
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:42,176
you feel, how it can just lift


779
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:42,846
you up.


780
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,396
Well, it also can lead to a


781
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:46,526
really great story.


782
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:48,796
Through beautiful fades,


783
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,136
transitions, and soundtrack,


784
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:52,846
this plays just like a great


785
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:53,396
movie.


786
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:55,616
And the camera holds on moments


787
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:57,196
that mean just a little bit


788
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:57,506
more.


789
00:28:57,766 --> 00:28:59,966
And this well-designed subtlety,


790
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:02,406
well, it makes you want to be


791
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:03,756
more present in your own life


792
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,056
and in your own relationships.


793
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:09,136
So, how does it turn out with


794
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:10,446
this other character?


795
00:29:10,446 --> 00:29:11,716
Well, you're just going to have


796
00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:13,526
to play the game to find out.


797
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:16,846
There's a reason why people have


798
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:17,716
a first love story.


799
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:19,716
Because, it's powerful,


800
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:21,876
emotional, and it has an impact.


801
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:23,836
And if you haven't experienced


802
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:25,906
it yet, well, this game is a


803
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,786
wonderful preview to the real,


804
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:30,456
honest, heart racing, and heart


805
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,586
wrenching roller coaster that is


806
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,386
first love.


807
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:36,456
So, go for it.


808
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:37,956
Play the game of first love.


809
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,626
It's an incredible unforgettable


810
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:40,856
ride.


811
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,356

Calzy from India.

[ Music ]


824
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:31,336
So, this is Raja.


825
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,876
Calzy was created in an effort


826
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,376
to rethink the conventional


827
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,046
calculator.


828
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:38,906
It's an incredibly customizable


829
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:41,296
really well-designed app.


830
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:43,606
And it uses a ton of iOS


831
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:44,356
technologies.


832
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:47,596
It's available for iPhone, iPad,


833
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,596
Apple Watch, Messages, and even


834
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:51,536
as a Today widget.


835
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:53,986
I'd like to ask my colleague,


836
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:56,576
Tyler, to show it to you, now.


837
00:30:56,816 --> 00:30:57,686
>> Thanks, John.


838
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,066
Calzy has a fantastic formula


839
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,456
for innovation, combining great


840
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:03,086
design with the clever use of


841
00:31:03,086 --> 00:31:04,006
iOS technologies.


842
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,176
Let's have a look.


843
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,676
There's Calzy, sweet as pi.


844
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:09,506
As you can see, right there,


845
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,846
it's got a simple yet elegant


846
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:12,376
layout.


847
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,846
And have a look at this, great


848

minds think alike.


849
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:20,336
So, Calzy does everything you'd


850
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,826
expect a calculator to do.


851
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:24,596
This single screen app is packed


852
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:26,966
with features revealed by using


853
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:29,126
3D Touch and haptic feedback for


854
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:30,056
these sliding menus.


855
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:32,026
Perfect for singlehanded use.


856
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:33,776
And if that single hand happens


857
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:34,946
to be your left hand the


858
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:36,426
keyboard is fully adjustable.


859
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:37,776
You can have different keyboard


860
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,196
layouts for the main app, as


861
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,486
well as the widget and the


862
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:42,306
iMessage's app for maximal


863
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:42,946
flexibility.


864
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:46,796
The standard layout, as you see


865
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:47,086
here.


866
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:48,536
Calzy, also, of course, supports


867
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:50,326
the scientific layout, no


868
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,356
rotation necessary.


869
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:53,306
Now, I'm not really a math


870
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:54,746
person, so these are all just


871
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,596
kind of Greek to me.


872
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:58,326
But speaking of science, I was


873
00:31:58,326 --> 00:31:59,416
recently reading an article.


874
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,306
At least, John smiled at that.


875
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,246
I was recently reading an


876
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:04,196
article about a very ambitious


877
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:06,056
effort to quantify the weight of


878
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:07,366
all the biomass on earth.


879
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:08,776
And so, I went to the study and


880
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:09,886
I grabbed some of the numbers


881
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,326
and I put them here in Calzy's


882
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:13,026
Bookmarks function, which is a


883
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:13,996
really handy way to store


884
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:14,596
information.


885
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,506
Here, we can see this is the sum


886
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:18,546
of the biomass of all the taxa


887
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:19,166
on the earth.


888
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:21,376
And it's rendered in gigatons of


889
00:32:21,376 --> 00:32:22,866
carbon, of course.


890
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,236
Anyway, the Bookmark stores both


891
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:27,166
the expression and the value.


892
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,326
So, if we find a new form of


893
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:29,506
life I can always update the


894
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:30,106
expression.


895
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:32,226
And then, the values themselves


896
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:33,616
can, actually, be stored up here


897
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:35,206
in the memory area at the top of


898
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:36,856
the screen, waiting patiently


899
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:37,986
for me to drag them into another


900
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:38,666
calculation.


901
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:41,236
So, you're probably wondering,


902
00:32:41,236 --> 00:32:42,796
or at least I know in am, what's


903
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,326
the prevalence of bacteria


904
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:45,646
versus people on the earth.


905
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,266
So, we go back in here to the


906
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:47,876
Bookmark.


907
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:48,936
I know you were wondering it.


908
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:50,296
And you take a look, here, the


909
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:52,036
weight of all bacteria on earth


910
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,436
is 70 gigatons.


911
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:55,256
I'm going to put that in there.


912
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:56,486
And then, we're going to divide


913
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:57,986
that by the weight of all the


914
00:32:58,036 --> 00:32:59,566
people on the earth, which is a


915
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:02,266
paltry .06 gigatons.


916
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:04,096
Now, if you notice that you've


917
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:05,426
made a mistake, all you have to


918
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:07,776
do is go into the expression, 3D


919
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,356
Touch on the operator, put the


920
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:10,146
correct one in.


921
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:12,016
And this way, you can see that


922
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:13,386
the weight of tall bacteria is


923
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:15,276
about 1,200 times greater than


924
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:16,376
the weight of all people.


925
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:17,736
That's a lot of bacteria.


926
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:18,786
So, wash your hands before


927
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:19,716
dinner tonight, folks.


928
00:33:20,736 --> 00:33:22,556
There's a lot more great things


929
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:23,586
Calzy can do that we don't have


930
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,486
a whole lot of time for.


931
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:25,676

932
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:27,886
like Handoff and iCloud Sync,


933
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:30,166
even Face ID, Touch ID

936
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:33,796
Whole bunch of great things.


937
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:34,756
Go ahead and check it out in the


938

939
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:37,086
But before we go, a quick note


940
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,806
about the inspirational story of


941
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:39,906
the developer behind it.


942
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:42,036
Gentleman from a small village


943
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:43,616
in India working as a visual


944
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:45,086
effects artist who decided he


945
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:46,706
wanted to harness his creativity


946
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:47,606
in a different way.


947
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:49,716
So, he taught himself Swift, as


948
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:50,096
you do.


949

And within just a few months,


950
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:53,336

Great games are memorable.


957
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:11,216
They're unique.


958
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:13,206
They're artistic.


959
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:15,835
They're filled with personality.


960
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:18,275
And they have great performance.


961
00:34:19,496 --> 00:34:21,076
Our next winner has all those


962
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:21,775
characteristics.

964
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:26,755

969
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,086
Brothers' second time on stage,


970
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:00,046
because another game of theirs,


971
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:02,566
called Blek, won an Apple Design


972
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:03,916
Award in 2014.


973
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:06,366
They've now returned with a


974
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:09,416
beautiful and calming freeform


975
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:11,896
puzzle game that offers a deeply


976
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:13,546
immersive space where players


977
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,656
can interact with and experience


978
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,986
the natural phenomenon of


979
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:17,736
swarms.


980
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:19,996
You've got to see this.

982
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:22,306
>> Thanks, John.


983
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:24,436
So, swarming behavior has


984
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,336
inspired scientists and artists


985
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,106
through the ages.


986
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,276
And now, it's inspired a really


987
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:31,256
gorgeous and inventive game.


988
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,136
Right from the level selection


989
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:34,246
screen we can see this number


990
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:36,296
one is comprised of tiny little


991
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:37,496
light creatures swarming about.


992
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,716
And as we switch between levels


993
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:41,016
we can see them scatter and


994
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,206
reform giving us a preview of


995
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,636
what's to come.


996
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:46,196
Now, when we get into the game


997
00:35:46,196 --> 00:35:47,656
we see this stream of blue


998
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:49,136
creatures enter the gameboard.


999
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:50,756
And our objective, here, is to


1000
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:52,456
help these little guys find


1001
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:53,636
their way back to their home


1002
00:35:53,636 --> 00:35:54,096
planets.


1003
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:56,426
Now, Frost was designed for


1004
00:35:56,426 --> 00:35:58,226
Touch and it really shows.


1005
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,926
Interactions are so simple and


1006
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,826
intuitive and natural.


1007
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:06,076
And just behold how graceful and


1008
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:08,056
beautiful the swarm is, just


1009
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:08,996
with a little bit of


1010
00:36:08,996 --> 00:36:10,076
interaction.


1011
00:36:10,076 --> 00:36:11,606
It's really pretty.


1012
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:13,896
Now, it seems here that the


1013
00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:16,476
objective it to try to take some


1014
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:17,636
of the blue creatures to one


1015
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,136
planet and some to the other.


1016
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,666
So, to start over I simply tap


1017
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:22,906
anywhere on the screen.


1018
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,676
And using multitouch I can draw


1019
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:27,526
two paths to each planet.


1020
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:29,846
Now, when those yellow rings


1021
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:31,796
fill, that's when I know how


1022
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:33,286
many creatures each planet has


1023
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:34,036
to hold.


1024
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:35,386
Little bit more.


1025
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:37,956
And once it fills all the way,


1026
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,776
this really beautiful animation


1027
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,126
plays to let me know that the


1028
00:36:41,126 --> 00:36:42,246
level is complete.


1029
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:43,756
And on iPhone, they use haptics


1030
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:46,306
to punctuate that animation and


1031
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:47,566
other special moments.


1032
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:50,276
Now, every level in Frost is a


1033
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,626
work of art.


1034
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,646
But I want to skip ahead here to


1035
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,386
a more advanced level and go


1036
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:58,476
from number 4 to number 24.


1037
00:36:58,476 --> 00:37:00,876
Now, as we progress through the


1038
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:03,006
game we're introduced to new


1039
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:04,566
creative challenges along the


1040
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:05,296
way.


1041
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:07,656
But also, new species with


1042
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:08,896
different types of swarming


1043
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:09,476
behaviors.


1044
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,656
So, on this level we have yellow


1045
00:37:11,656 --> 00:37:13,736
creatures and blue and red.


1046
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:15,156
And it seems, here, that my


1047
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:16,426
objective is to help the yellow


1048
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:17,446
creatures get to the yellow


1049
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:17,886
planet.


1050
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:19,516
So, I just make a beeline from


1051
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:20,416
one place to another, but


1052
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:21,776
they're not responding.


1053
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:23,316
Blue ones don't really do


1054
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:24,256
anything, either.


1055
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,646
Maybe, if I bring the red ones


1056
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,676
over here it'll do something.


1057
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:29,786
Oh, we can see those blue


1058
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:31,096
creatures really scattered.


1059
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:32,956
Now, what I want to do is just


1060
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,466
pause here, for a second, and


1061
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,196
just kind of enjoy this moment


1062
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:38,506
that Frost creates for us.


1063
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:40,766
The mood that it sets is so


1064
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:42,906
ethereal, it's so soothing and


1065
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:43,646
so tranquil.


1066
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:45,246
Watching these creatures move


1067
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:47,166
around is really mesmerizing and


1068
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,116
kind of hypnotic.


1069
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:50,076
A lot of players will, actually,


1070
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:53,436
just kind of stop and enjoy this


1071
00:37:53,476 --> 00:37:55,206
experience and experiment and


1072
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,356
observe how the creatures


1073
00:37:56,356 --> 00:37:58,426
respond to touch, and really


1074
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,056
soak it in.


1075
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:01,846
But, not me.


1076
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:02,486
I like winning.


1077
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:04,896
So, I'm going to try to get the


1078
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:07,276
red creatures to move around,


1079
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:08,586
pick up the blue creatures who


1080
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:10,306
might give a lift to the yellow


1081
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:10,786
creatures.


1082
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,296
And help them find their way


1083
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:12,586
home.


1084
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:14,516
It's a crazy enough plan that I


1085
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:15,596
think it just might work.


1086
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:18,536
Now, Frost offers hours and


1087
00:38:18,536 --> 00:38:20,136
hours of gameplay.


1088
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:22,326
And the sheer beauty of watching


1089
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:23,896
thousands of individually


1090
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:25,666
animating creatures move around


1091
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,036
your iPhone or iPad is really


1092
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:28,756
breathtaking.


1093
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,756
Now, in order to power this real


1094
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:34,606
time simulation, they needed


1095
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:35,766
Metal on iOS.


1096
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,686
It's the only consumer mobile


1097
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:38,846
device which has the


1098
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:41,406
computational power needed to


1099
00:38:41,456 --> 00:38:42,786
render these complex


1100
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:44,836
programmatic animations.


1101
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:47,476
But the thing that I love most


1102
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:50,526
about Frost is how anyone can


1103
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:51,916
play this game, regardless of


1104
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:54,216
their age or where they live or


1105
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:55,676
what language they speak.


1106
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:57,856
It can be a delightful, calming,


1107
00:38:57,856 --> 00:38:59,176
and engaging experience.


1108
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:02,006
This is a really beautiful game.


1109
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:02,826

Earlier, I spoke of code and


1116
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:18,416
creativity, which when combined


1117
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:20,246
with technology can produce


1118
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:21,536
these transformative results.


1119
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:23,856
Our next winner is an app that


1120
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,786

believe it.

Especially, in healthcare.


1139
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:24,906
Today, many clinicians have no


1140
00:40:24,906 --> 00:40:26,416
idea how to estimate how much


1141

1144
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:32,846
decisions are made based on


1145
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:34,886
guesstimation, which can lead to


1146
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:36,806
all sorts of complications.


1147
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:39,036
Gauss Surgical is solving this


1148
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,576
problem using an iPad, machine


1149
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:43,216
learning, and computer vision.


1150
00:40:43,736 --> 00:40:45,256
Before we show you a demo, I'd


1151
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,626
like to introduce you to Chris


1152
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:47,976
and the tools we'll be using.


1153
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:51,436
We have an iPad Pro with an IR


1154
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:53,016
sensor, and some surgical


1155
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,326
sponges that are used in


1156
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,906
operating rooms to soak up


1157
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:56,626
blood.


1158
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:58,526
Now, for the purposes of this


1159
00:40:58,526 --> 00:40:59,956
demo, we're going to mimic some


1160
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:01,926
fake blood by using some red


1161
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:02,876
food coloring.


1162
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,986
But if you start to feel queasy,


1163
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:07,066
at all, please avert your eyes


1164
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:08,156
for just a moment.


1165
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:11,556
Gauss' app is super simple to


1166
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:11,916
use.


1167
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,036
All you have to do is hold up a


1168
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,286
sponge in front of the camera.


1169
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:18,696
From there, Gauss uses Core ML


1170
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:20,446
to detect the sponge using the


1171
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:21,836
camera and IR sensor.


1172
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:23,616
They've then developed some


1173
00:41:23,706 --> 00:41:24,896
custom machine learning


1174
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:27,166
algorithms to analyze the red


1175
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,806
spots of blood and, actually,


1176
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:30,086
calculate blood loss.


1177
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:31,536
It's amazing.


1178
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:34,386
Gauss' app is FDA approved and


1179
00:41:34,386 --> 00:41:36,026
HIPAA compliant.


1180
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:38,986
But now, let's see if it's hippo


1181
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:39,616
compliant.


1182
00:41:39,616 --> 00:41:42,536
As you can imagine.


1183
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:44,766
As you can imagine, it's


1184
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,156
incredibly important in an


1185
00:41:46,156 --> 00:41:47,946
operating room to make sure you


1186
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,516
don't accidentally double count


1187
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:50,096
a sponge.


1188
00:41:50,636 --> 00:41:52,376
So, if Chris hold up the hippo


1189
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,896
sponge one more time, even if in


1190
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:57,366
a different orientation, Gauss'


1191
00:41:57,566 --> 00:42:00,156
app is able to detect that it's


1192
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:01,986
a duplicate and, actually, alert


1193
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:02,146
Chris


1194
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,176
to the duplication.


1195
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,266
That is amazing.


1196
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:08,226
Gauss' app is being used in


1197
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,086
hospitals all across the country


1198
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:12,436
in labor and delivery use cases.


1199
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,036
And we couldn't be more excited


1200
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:14,916
about their work.


1201
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:16,926
Congrats to the entire Gauss


1202
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:17,296

1207
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:26,456
That's pretty cool.


1208

And our final award for this


1209
00:42:29,986 --> 00:42:31,606
evening goes to a brilliantly


1210
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:32,936
executed platformer.


1211
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,366
It's got a ton of personality,


1212
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,496
has great performance, a fun


1213
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:40,546
soundtrack, and it's super


1214
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:40,966
addictive.


1215
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:43,506
And it took four years to make.


1216
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:45,626
Join me in celebrating our final


1217
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:47,616
winner, Oddmar by Mobge.


1218
00:42:48,516 --> 00:43:16,500
[ Music ]


1219
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:18,546
Oddmar was developed by a team,


1220
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:20,226
a small team of four, two of


1221
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:22,156
whom are here, at a university


1222
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:23,906
in Turkey, which goes to show


1223
00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:25,296
that great games don't always


1224
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:26,306
come from the places that you


1225
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:26,846
would expect.


1226
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:29,406
We've had a blast with this game


1227
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,906
and we think you will, too.


1228
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:32,386
We'd like to show it to you,


1229
00:43:32,386 --> 00:43:32,656
now.


1230

1231
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:39,786
>> Thank you, John.


1232
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:41,956
Oddmar is a gorgeous


1233
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:44,046
action-adventure platformer that


1234
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:45,856
is beautiful, charming, and


1235
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:46,366
humorous.


1236
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:48,606
Let us introduce you to Oddmar


1237
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:50,826
and our not so successful Viking


1238
00:43:50,826 --> 00:43:52,356
hero on the journey to prove


1239
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:53,976
himself worthy of Valhalla.

>> The onboarding is smooth and


1242
00:43:57,656 --> 00:43:59,276
the controls are easy to use


1243
00:43:59,276 --> 00:44:00,136
gesture controls.


1244
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:01,806
Simply, swipe left and right

secrets and challenges.


1252
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:15,426
As you travel through the


1253
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:16,926
adventures of Oddmar, from


1254
00:44:16,926 --> 00:44:18,456
magical forests to treacherous


1255
00:44:18,546 --> 00:44:20,446
mines, beautifully animated


1256
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:22,166
comic style cuts scenes between


1257
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:23,806
the levels will help you find


1258
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:24,776
your way to Valhalla.


1259
00:44:25,386 --> 00:44:27,106
The game really shines with its


1260
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:28,626
visual elements, with beautiful


1261
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:30,616
scenic multiplane landscapes,


1262
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:32,156
lighting, and animation that


1263
00:44:32,156 --> 00:44:33,346
almost brings it to life.


1264
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:36,086
Oddmar, our Viking hero, is so


1265
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:38,156
brilliantly animated that it


1266
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:39,426
puts a smile on your face,


1267
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:40,846
whether he's jumping on


1268
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,486
mushrooms, running through the


1269
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:43,746
rivers, or as he's simply


1270
00:44:43,746 --> 00:44:44,916
waiting for you to play.


1271
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:47,776
New game mechanics and controls


1272
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:49,166
are introduced for the player at


1273
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:49,806
every level.


1274
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,286
And as the players progress


1275
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:52,466
through the levels, unique


1276
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:53,886
dangers and boss fights


1277
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,236

and fun ways.


1279
00:44:57,366 --> 00:44:59,386
The game really does a fantastic


1280
00:44:59,536 --> 00:45:01,466
job of bringing excitement with


1281
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:03,736
every new character, control,


1282
00:45:03,736 --> 00:45:05,666
and level, while introducing


1283
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,186
these at a pace that allows the


1284
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:08,176
players to master it.


1285
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,656
The soundtrack influenced by the


1286
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:13,266
traditional Swedish folk music


1287
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:17,156
really gives the game its Nordic


1288
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:18,716
Viking setting at every level.


1289
00:45:19,866 --> 00:45:21,926
It was recorded at a studio in a


1290
00:45:21,926 --> 00:45:23,296
small village deep in the


1291
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:25,000
forests of southern Sweden.


1292
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:27,876
So, every aspect of the game,


1293
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:30,516
from level design to story to


1294
00:45:30,516 --> 00:45:32,116
music was made with great


1295
00:45:32,306 --> 00:45:33,566
effort, dedication to detail,


1296
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:34,536

1297
00:45:35,386 --> 00:45:37,256
As visually stunning as it is


1298
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:38,556
with the level of detail and


1299
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:40,416
artwork, Oddmar calls for a


1300
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:42,636
larger screenplay and we think


1301
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:44,046
you will love it on iPad Pro.

It supports the use of game


1303
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:48,416

1306
00:45:52,746 --> 00:45:54,596
Oddmar benefits from using Metal


1307
00:45:54,856 --> 00:45:56,646
to create this visually stunning

and fluid gameplay experience.


1309
00:45:59,106 --> 00:45:59,846
It uses only [inaudible]


1310
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:01,836
resources to reduce the initial


1311
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,736
time to load by letting players


1312
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:04,806
download the levels in the

1316
00:46:10,536 --> 00:46:12,046
Oddmar is localized into 12


1317

00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:44,136
trophy, which they've all been


1331
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:45,166
handed and are walking away


1332
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:45,826
with, right now.


1333
00:46:47,006 --> 00:46:48,986
This trophy is a solid piece of


1334
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:51,496
aluminum that lights up when


1335
00:46:51,496 --> 00:46:51,986
touched.


1336
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:54,926
So, the Apple logo on top lights


1337
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:56,436
up just like the top of your


1338
00:46:56,436 --> 00:46:57,056
laptop.


1339
00:46:57,476 --> 00:47:01,046
It's very cool and it's a


1340
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:02,106
must-have.


1341
00:47:02,106 --> 00:47:03,196
It's definitely something to


1342
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,406
collect and something to be


1343
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:05,546
super proud of.


1344
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:09,626
Winners today, also, receive a


1345
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,196
prize package that includes


1346
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:12,796
almost one of everything that we


1347
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:15,686
make in its best configuration.


1348
00:47:16,776 --> 00:47:22,026
So, a 5K iMac Pro, a 15-inch


1349
00:47:22,196 --> 00:47:27,576
MacBook Pro, a 256 GB iPhone 10,


1350
00:47:28,336 --> 00:47:30,646
a 512 GB iPad Pro with Apple


1351
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:36,076
Pencil, a 4K Apple TV, an Apple


1352
00:47:36,076 --> 00:47:40,856
Watch Series 3, and a set of


1353
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:41,666
AirPods.


1354
00:47:42,846 --> 00:47:45,776
Not a bad haul.


1355
00:47:46,516 --> 00:47:51,500
[ Applause ]


1356
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:53,106
Not a bad haul.


1357
00:47:54,336 --> 00:47:55,786
So, congratulations to all of


1358
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:56,596
our winners, tonight.


1359
00:47:56,596 --> 00:47:58,596
And for the great work that


1360
00:47:58,596 --> 00:48:00,266
they've done in the past year or


1361
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:01,556
years, in some cases.


1362
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:03,976
These ten apps set new standards


1363
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:06,356
for innovation, design,


1364
00:48:07,116 --> 00:48:09,396
brilliance, execution,


1365
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,186
performance, creativity,


1366
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:15,006
craftsmanship, optimization,


1367
00:48:15,386 --> 00:48:17,366
technology integration, and so


1368
00:48:17,366 --> 00:48:17,876
much more.


1369
00:48:20,256 --> 00:48:21,726
I want to thank you for joining


1370
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:22,216

1371
00:48:22,216 --> 00:48:23,686

This is a special moment for all


1374
00:48:28,046 --> 00:48:28,586
of our winners.


1375
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:30,466
But it's, also, a special moment


1376
00:48:30,506 --> 00:48:32,696
for you, their peers, and for


1377
00:48:32,696 --> 00:48:33,876
our entire development


1378
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:35,266
community, many of whom are


1379
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:36,426

tonight.


1383
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:40,516
We're excited to see what you'll


1384
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:43,056

1385
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:45,256
next year inspired by these


1386
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:45,706
winners.

1388
00:48:47,036 --> 00:48:48,046
See what they've done.


1389
00:48:48,046 --> 00:48:48,976
Learn from them.


1390
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:50,276
They've done an incredible job.


1391
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:52,376
As well as being inspired by all


1392
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:53,146
of the new things that we


1393
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:53,826
announced, today.


1394
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:55,536
Thanks for coming.


1395
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:56,286
Good night.
