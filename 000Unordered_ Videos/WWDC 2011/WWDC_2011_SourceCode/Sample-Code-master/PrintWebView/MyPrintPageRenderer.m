/*
 For the case where we are not doing SIMPLE_LAYOUT, this code does the following:
 1) Makes the minimum margin for the content of the content portion of the printout (i.e. the webpage) at least 1/4" away from the edge of the paper. If the hardware margins of the paper are greater than that, then the hardware margins will force the content margins to be as large as they allow.
 2) Because this format is relative to the edge of the sheet rather than the imageable area, we need to compute these values once we know the paper size and printableRect. This is known in the numberOfPages method and that is the reason this code overrides that method.
 3) Since the header and footer heights of a UIPrintFormatter plays a part in determining height of of the content area, this code computes those heights, taking into account that we want the minimum 1/4" margin on the content.
 4) This code also enforces a minimum distance (MIN_HEADER_FOOTER_DISTANCE_FROM_CONTENT) between the header and footer and the content area.
 5) Note that the insets used for the contentInsets property of a UIPrintFormatter are relative to the imageable area of the paper being printed upon. The header and footer height are also imposed relative to the edge of the top and bottom hardware margin.
