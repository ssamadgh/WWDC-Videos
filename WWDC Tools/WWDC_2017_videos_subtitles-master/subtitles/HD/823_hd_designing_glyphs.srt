3
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,356
>> Let's talk about designing


4
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:22,566
glyphs, and I think a good place


5
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,916
to start is what is a glyph?


6
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:26,646
A glyph, traditionally, is a


7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,346
topographical character, but it


8
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,305
could also be a symbol or a


9
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,886
simple shape of a real world


10
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:37,766
object, or it can be a


11
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,956
combination of shapes to


12
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,866
represent function or a concept.


13
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:44,046
But you might be thinking what


14
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:45,666
is the difference between this


15
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,276
and an icon.


16
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,496
So, to help illustrate the


17
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:50,006
difference, let's take a look at


18
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,476
this example of four iPhone


19
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:51,896
icons.


20
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:56,096
An icon can refer to a broad set


21
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,516
of assets ranging from simple


22
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,766
low fidelity shapes like you can


23
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,916
see on the left to illustrative,


24
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,756
colorful, and highly rendered


25
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:07,256
assets that you can see on the


26
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:07,546
right.


27
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:11,156
The two assets on the left can


28
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:13,866
also be defined as glyphs, and


29
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:14,366
that's because of their


30
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,426
simplicity, and for the most


31
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,676
part, glyphs are monochromatic


32
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:19,686
and should be colorized


33
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:20,366
programmatically.


34
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,866
This is the iOS wallet app icon,


35
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:27,636
and you can see a nice use of


36
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:30,176
color and some subtle shading.


37
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:33,776
And here's the app represented


38
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:34,166
as a glyph.


39
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,526
So, you get the idea, but let's


40
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,626
take a look at one more example.


41
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:43,576
This is the phone app icon, and


42
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:44,946
if we take away that iconic


43
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:48,846
shape and the color, you see


44
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:49,806
where I'm going with this, we're


45
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:50,636
left with this glyph.


46
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:52,466
So, in this case, the glyph is


47
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,586
actually part of what makes up


48
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:54,086
the icon.


49
00:01:56,636 --> 00:01:58,836
Now, effective glyphs have some


50
00:01:58,836 --> 00:01:59,706
key characteristics.


51
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,116
They're highly simplified in


52
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:02,556
form.


53
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:05,776
They're conceptually universal,


54
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,265
and they're quickly readable in


55
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:11,045
context as to their function or


56
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:11,426
purpose.


57
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:16,606
Many of us have experienced


58
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:17,676
being in a foreign place,


59
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:19,966
somewhere where we don't, you


60
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,396
know, relate to the culture or


61
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:23,746
another language, and it can be


62
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:24,696
quite a relief when we see a


63
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:25,816
symbol that we recognize.


64
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:27,906
So, in this case, you don't have


65
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:31,106
to know German to know the right


66
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:33,896
way to the airport, and that's


67
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:36,786
thanks to this simple universal


68
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:38,546
shape, which in this context we


69
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:40,596
understand to represent airport.


70
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:44,006
So, glyphs are a powerful


71
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:45,036
communication tool, and that's


72
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,156
why we make them part of our


73
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:46,976
design language in UI.


74
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:53,586
So, let's go through a quick


75
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:55,776
exercise to conceptualize an


76
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:56,566
effective glyph.


77
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:58,756
Let's say we need one to


78
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:00,266
represent delicious.


79
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:02,916
The first thing you might think


80
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,766
of is a cheeseburger, and you


81
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,826
would have no argument from me.


82
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:09,046
I do think cheeseburgers are


83
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:09,566
delicious.


84
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,486
But believe it or not, some


85
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:13,726
people do not like


86
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,256
cheeseburgers.


87
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:15,796
So, what's better than a


88
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,316
cheeseburger?


89
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:20,716
Pizza? I see some people shaking


90
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:21,056
their heads.


91
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:21,866
I don't know.


92
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,836
Okay. I think I got one that we


93
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,906
can all relate to.


94
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,006
How about ice cream?


95
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:29,066
No. Well, all right, well, I


96
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,336
think I could -- you got the


97
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,246
idea here -- not everyone


98
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,776
relates to these specific food


99
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,106
items in the same way.


100
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:39,076
So, these aren't effective.


101
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:40,216
So, let's try something a little


102
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:42,906
bit different, and what about


103
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,166
something to get to the core of


104
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,406
what delicious might make us


105
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:45,706
feel.


106
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,086
Something like a facial


107
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:49,566
expression.


108
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:51,606
It's cute and relatable,


109
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,046
expressive, but we should be


110
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,106
mindful here that in some


111
00:03:56,106 --> 00:04:00,066
cultures using like a face, a


112
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,926
mouth, or a body part can be


113
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:05,536
seen as inappropriate; so, be


114
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,326
mindful of that.


115
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:09,006
So, what is a universal symbol


116
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:09,756
for delicious?


117
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,196
What about a heart?


118
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,625
We love cheeseburgers.


119
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,456
Some people like pizza.


120
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,356
Some people love ice cream.


121
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,086
The association of love with


122
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,776
delicious is much more universal


123
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:24,646
than our other options.


124
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:27,176
So, this is a nice effective


125
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:27,636
solution.


126
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,366
Okay. So, let's take a look at


127
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,236
some examples of where we use


128
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:37,686
glyphs on our platforms, on the


129
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:43,416
Mac, in the menu bar, in tool


130
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:48,126
bars, and in sidebars, and most


131
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:50,966
recently, in the touch bar.


132
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:57,966
On iOS, in tab bars, list views,


133
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,066
and home screen quick action


134
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:01,306
menus.


135
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,246
So, you can see, glyphs are


136
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:05,826
everywhere, and also notice that


137
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:07,166
they rarely ever stand alone.


138
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,746
So, that's why we need to be


139
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:10,656
mindful of some design


140
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,866
considerations when, you know,


141
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,266
we're crafting a set of glyphs.


142
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:18,646
Our goal should be to make them


143
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:20,646
feel like a family, and a family


144
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:21,536
has a shared set of


145
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:22,256
characteristics.


146
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,266
So, we're going to look at


147
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:30,106
optical weight, lines, and


148
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:30,566
positioning.


149
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:37,536
In this example, the set feels a


150
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,316
bit right heavy.


151
00:05:39,346 --> 00:05:42,716
The two glyphs on the left just


152
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,576
are optically smaller, and


153
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,166
consequently they feel a bit


154
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:46,806
less significant.


155
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:49,226
So, if we turn on our guides, we


156
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,526
can see that we've constrained


157
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:51,696
ourselves to these vertical


158
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:52,076
bounds.


159
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,926
Let's turn those off and scale


160
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:58,626
the up optically, and that feels


161
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,046
much better.


162
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:04,166
Here's the before and the after.


163
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,256
Because the elliptical shape of


164
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,366
messages and the narrow shape of


165
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,136
phone have less surface area, we


166
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,766
can use scale to achieve this


167
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:14,656
optical balance.


168
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,056
And let's notice another subtle


169
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,516
detail in the set here that


170
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:20,506
helps the family of these


171
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:20,906
glyphs.


172
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,156
Look at the gap in the video


173
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:27,236
camera and the negative space in


174
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:27,756
the envelope.


175
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,126
They share the same line weight.


176
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:30,636
So, let's look at lines next.


177
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:38,026
Here, it looks like the glyphs


178
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:39,026
might have been scaled from


179
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:41,196
various places to fit together


180
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:41,966
at the size.


181
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,526
But because they don't share a


182
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:46,676
consistent line weight, some


183
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,186
look more emphasized than


184
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:49,006
others, and this can be


185
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:52,196
confusing, and they just don't


186
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:52,686
family well.


187
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:55,516
So, when we normalize these,


188
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,486
we've created a much more


189
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:58,256
coherent set.


190
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:05,456
Here's the before and the after.


191
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,516
A subtle change like this can


192
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,976
really affect the integrity of


193
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:09,276
your app.


194
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:11,646
Let's move on to positioning.


195
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,456
And this is a great example here


196
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,646
of optical positioning, which


197
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,866
can sometimes be overlooked, and


198
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,126
we can really see it when we


199
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,536
introduce this centered circle


200
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:24,396
around that Play glyph.


201
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:27,726
Notice, that art is perfectly


202
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,946
centered within that space, but


203
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,516
optically, it just, it just


204
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:31,926
looks off.


205
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:34,226
So, if we nudge that over a few


206
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:37,896
pixels to the right, we achieve


207
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,046
a much more balanced result.


208
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,086
So, here's the before and the


209
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:44,106
after.


210
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:47,316
And optical positioning can


211
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,326
apply to almost any asset that's


212
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,816
asymmetrical or heavier on one


213
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:52,576
side than the other.


214
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:55,816
In this example, the share glyph


215
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:57,916
is, again, perfectly centered


216
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,916
within that space, but it just


217
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,406
looks like it's sitting a bit


218
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:01,786
too low.


219
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:04,726
So, by nudging it up a few


220
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,156
pixels, we achieve, again, a


221
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:07,896
much more considered result.


222
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:11,896
And by the way, you can bake


223
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:12,916
this padding right into the


224
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:13,366
asset.


225
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:15,826
So, when you go to integrate,


226
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:17,906
you just center that asset


227
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:20,336
perfectly in that space, and any


228
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:22,466
adjustments that are needed be


229
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:23,576
done with a simple [inaudible]


230
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:24,056
as well.


231
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:27,316
So, when you're crafting your


232
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:31,116
glyphs, build them as sets.


233
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,546
Test them in context, and always


234
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:36,876
preview them on device, and this


235
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:37,466
will help you achieve these


236
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:37,976
results.


237
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:45,116
So, when you're creating


238
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,056
something from scratch, it can


239
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:47,716
often be hard to find a starting


240
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:47,976
point.


241
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,056
It could be overwhelming.


242
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:52,156
So, how do you get started?


243
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,136
Let's look at a couple of


244
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:54,266
considerations that can help.


245
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,096
When designing for spaces inside


246
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:59,076
of your app, you know, such as


247
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:01,346
list views or buttons, consider


248
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:02,876
the relationship between type


249
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,926
and the glyphs.


250
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:06,666
If you have a light type style,


251
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,386
consider matching your lines to


252
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,196
the weight of the type.


253
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:11,616
If you have a heavy type style,


254
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,396
or more weighted, or filled


255
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,516
glyph style, it might be more


256
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:14,916
appropriate.


257
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,196
Here's an example from Airbnb.


258
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:21,926
Notice the lines of the glyphs


259
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,106
match the fonts nicely.


260
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:24,376
Looks like they really


261
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:25,466
considered that relationship


262
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,696
between type and glyphs, and it


263
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:26,946
looks nice.


264
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:34,126
Now, for system spaces, such as


265
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,986
the Touch Bar on the Mac or Home


266
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,956
screen quick action menus on


267
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,256
iOS, and the central resource


268
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:42,916
can be the existing system


269
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:44,036
assets.


270
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,056
In Airbnb's Home screen quick


271
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,136
action menu, we can see the


272
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,296
consistency between their custom


273
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:53,916
glyphs and the platforms shared


274
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:54,136
glyphs.


275
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:57,956
And notice, these glyphs are a


276
00:09:57,956 --> 00:09:59,466
bit larger and heavier than


277
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,546
their in-app counterparts.


278
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:03,846
So, this is an excellent example


279
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,586
of craftsmanship here by Airbnb.


280
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:10,316
Now, we have templates on the


281
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,916
human interface guidelines to


282
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,656
help you match optical weight


283
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,766
lines and positioning.


284
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:19,106
This will help you save time, be


285
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:20,706
harmonious with the established


286
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,596
design language, and you can


287
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:23,986
even output your assets directly


288
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:24,746
from these templates, which is


289
00:10:24,746 --> 00:10:24,976
really nice.


290
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:29,436
All right.


291
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:30,756
So, we've gone over a bunch of


292
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,126
things here in a short period of


293
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:32,346
time.


294
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:33,456
Let's do a quick recap.


295
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:35,986
When conceptualizing a glyph,


296
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,886
simplify and think globally.


297
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,946
When crafting them, build them


298
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,376
as sets and test them in context


299
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:47,026
to make them feel like a family.


300
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:52,346
Consider the relationship of


301
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:53,826
type in your glyphs.


302
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:58,966
And finally, adapt your assets


303
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,436
for system spaces.


304
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:03,266
So, I hope that these tips will


305
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,786
help you build more effective


306
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:06,496
and delightful experiences.


307
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,366
But wait a minute, something


308
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,046
looks wrong here.


309
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:10,926
That's much better.


310
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:11,976
Thank you very much.
