00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:37,116
>> Good afternoon


8
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:37,756
>> Welcome.


9
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:41,066
We have a great -- great
event for you right now,


10
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:45,226
and we just -- we're just so
thrilled that you are here.


11
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:47,506
You came back after
the state of the union.


12
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:51,846
This is a non-technical session
so you can just relax and enjoy


13
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:55,056
as we celebrate some
really cool apps.


14
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,106
>> These are exciting times
of growth and innovation.


15
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:02,476
>> You know, today we are
here to celebrate excellence


16
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:05,766
in design and innovation
on iOS and OS X.


17
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,426
>> Each year finding the
best apps becomes more


18
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:09,276
and more challenging.


19
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:14,036
>> There are more developers,
more apps, more technologies,


20
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:17,626
more ideas, more
innovation every day.


21
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,946
>> Before we began, we
want to acknowledge you,


22
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:23,236
the developers who've
worked so hard to make all


23
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:27,406
of the amazing iOS and OS
X apps that people love


24
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:28,626
and that have changed
our culture.


25
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:33,616
>> They've changed the way that
we work, the way that we play,


26
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:34,946
and the way that we connect.


27
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:37,886
And we just -- we just want
to take a moment to thank you


28
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:40,866
for your hard work and anybody
else who's watching this event


29
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:41,976

>> Tonight's winners were
selected by dozens of judges


32
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:55,946
from across Apple using a
variety of selection criteria.


33
00:01:57,266 --> 00:02:00,246
>> You know, this is my
thirteenth year doing the Design


34
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,866
Awards and we have changed
the way that we judge things,


35
00:02:03,926 --> 00:02:06,856
but we still look for many of
the same qualities in apps.


36
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:09,205
We look for apps
that are attractive


37
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:11,206
and have strong visual design.


38
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:14,106
We look for apps that
have intuitive interaction


39
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,906
or really great gameplay.


40
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:19,076
We look for apps that have
great attention to detail.


41
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:22,186
And we look for apps with
high production value.


42
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:26,206
We also look for apps
that are high performance,


43
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,946
that are super responsive,
and give immediate feedback.


44
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,066
We look for apps that have
deep system integration


45
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:36,526
and that take advantage of all
relevant Apple technologies.


46
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,766
And finally, we look for
apps that are unique,


47
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:44,626
apps that bring an innovation
or new approach to something,


48
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:47,446
or they bring innovative
gameplay in a way


49
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:48,726
that we've never seen before.


50
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,156
And these are the
kinds of things --


51
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,306
well-designed, state-of-the-art,
and innovative --


52
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:58,446
these are the attributes
that bring people back again


53
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,166
and again and again
to great apps.


54
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,596
>> Each winner today will
receive an amazing set


55
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:11,216
of prizes: The 13-inch
MacBook Air, an Apple TV,


56
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:16,026
a 27-inch iMac, 15-inch MacBook
Pro with Retina display --


57
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:21,236
>> And winners will also
receive a 64-gig iPad Mini,

62
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,196

pretty much one

of everything that Apple makes.

new people here at the AD --


67

at WWDC this year, and at the
ceremony I bet you didn't knows


68
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,666
that these cubes light
up when you touch them.


69
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,836
They are touch sensitive and
the Apple logo glows just


70
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,916
like the back of your
MacBook Pro screen.


71
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,176
So that is very cool.

00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:04,646

with our winners.

and then when we're finished,

00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,946
you're going to exit

all the work, yeah.

00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,016
Michael's at home.


103
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:15,956
Well, he's going to
benefit from this anyway.


104
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,276
You know, this is an
app that manages short,


105
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:20,636
medium, long-term tasks.


106
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,716
These guys put it together
probably 'cause they're not


107
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,996
that good with that and they
are procrastinators themselves.


108
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,716
But we thought this
was such a great app


109
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,146
by a couple of students.


110
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,546
It uses numerous
iOS technologies,


111
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,516
integrates with Facebook
and Twitter


112
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,966
so that you can share tasks
with other students that are


113
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,546
in your class or in your year.


114
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:40,986
It looks great on
Retina display,


115
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,176
and is totally optimized
for iPhone 5.


116
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:44,296
So congratulations.


117
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:44,786

Congratulations.


132
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,606
This app is built
by students from MIT


133
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,066
and the University
of Pittsburgh.


134
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:27,716
It magically connects
two or more iOS devices

into a beautiful mosaic.

the swipe of a finger.


137

It's like having your very
own personal hypertable.

Let's take a look.


139
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:36,806
>> All right.


140
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:39,186
So here's a video that we asked
these guys to put together,


141
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,236
and they had no idea that
they were doing this for us.


142
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:44,386
But these are self-taught
iOS developers.


143
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:47,146
They put a prototype for this
app together in a weekend,


144
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:50,316
and it creates a mosaic
across multiple screens;


145
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:53,716
so you select an image, and
then it uses core animation,


146
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:55,886
device motion, and gestures


147
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,396
to determine the devices'
relative location to each other


148
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,986
and which determine which
part of the image it draws.


149
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:03,026
So watch this.


150
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,196
They're going to add an iPad;
now they're going to swipe


151
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:08,436
across the three devices, and
it will reposition that image


152
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,926
across those three devices.


153
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,786

00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:08,856
>> You know, who doesn't
know the Panic guys, right?


177
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,656
And I think that they're
going to love adding this


178
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,506
to their display of ADAs.


179
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:18,956
But, you know, Coda 1, five
years ago or six years ago


180
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:23,696
in 2007, won and ADA, and we
at the time thought it was just


181
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:24,876
such an incredible app.


182
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:29,136
And we felt that these
guys deserved a new ADA


183
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:33,515
because Coda 2, it's been
six years in the oven,


184
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,746
and it is just -- it
is so much stronger


185
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,905
and it's a majoring
update to the app


186
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:40,025
that they had previously.


187
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,166
And you know what?


188
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,916
More than anything else, we felt


189
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,076
that this app was
a shining example


190
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:49,116
of what a great Mac app is
supposed to look like and behave


191
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,536
like and be built like.


192
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:54,606
And it's a highly flexible
IDE for web development


193
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:59,556
with very customizable UI;
it has an extensive use of --


194
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:02,356
extensive support for plug-ins
so they can add on a lot


195
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:05,936
of extra functionality; and they
support endless web development


196
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:11,486
technologies and languages --
ActionScript, ASP, CFML, CSS,


197
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:14,856
HTML, Java, JavaScript,
and the list goes on.


198
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:20,476
This app is deeply integrated
with OS X, and the guys


199
00:09:20,556 --> 00:09:21,916
at Panic know how to do this.


200
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:24,386
Many of you probably
consult with them


201
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,136
for assistance --
technical assistance.


202
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:29,796
The app is built on AppKit,
as are most OS X apps,


203
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,746
but they do everything
the right way.


204
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:35,546
They're built on core animation,
iCloud, Notification Center;


205
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:37,076
they use QuickLook;
they're integrated


206
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,526
with AirPlay and more.


207
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:41,086
And probably the coolest


208
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:45,366
and most innovative feature
is AirPlay, which is tied


209
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,456
to Diet Coda on the iPad


210
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:48,276
>> AirPreview.


211
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:49,286
>> AirPreview, sorry.


212
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,986
It allows you to
dynamically preview the work


213
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:54,856
that you're doing, the
code that you're making,


214
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,566
you can preview that
on the iPad.


215
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,796
And so Coda and Diet
Coda together,


216
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,606
they complement one another,


217
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:04,436
and they provide an
award-winning OS X


218
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,466
and iOS web development
solution.


219
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:08,076

It's expertly crafted in the

238
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:12,336
I mean, all of the graphics are

239
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:16,336
It has engaging physics-based
gameplay mixed with humor

and a really fun
soundtrack that reverses


241

This app explores the
lives of endangered species


257
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,696
such as tigers, elephants,
and polar bears.


258
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:15,976
Built from the ground
up with iPad in mind,


259
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,956
it features exquisite
visual design


260

It was probably one of the

It's got outstanding attention

and then you drill down
into more information

about them is fantastic.

00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,016
It's just got this great

took this app on the Mac,


294
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,596
it's across multiple
IOS devices as well,


295
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,336
but they took the
Mac app recently


296
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,736
and they completely
rewrote this client.


297
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,446
And they gave it a redesigned
Retina display optimized modern


298
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:17,346
single-window UI.


299
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:19,096
>> We'll do photos later.


300
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,136
>> They also took advantage of
more technologies on Mac OS X


301
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:27,316
than a lot of apps I've seen.


302
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:31,566
They integrate with iCloud,

of ways to locate your notes


310
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,376

314
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:04,436
of the app, and even
a Safari extension.


315
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,366
These guys -- this teams
and your extended team,


316
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,046
have shown -- I think
they've set the bar


317
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:12,806
for showing how you can
differentiate an app


318
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,096
on these platforms and
do with the right way.


319
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:19,456

great layouts and typography;

to detail we felt meant
that this app stood


366
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,596
out in a really saturated
category.


367
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,266
This is the way to get
attention: By doing something

that is fantastic like this.

on word games that's a perfect
blend of fun and strategy.

thing about this app is,

I don't think you were good
with words in school, were you?


387

Yeah. Terrible with
words in school.


388
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,216
So that's what you got to do is
write apps that are, you know --


389
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:45,376
but this is a deceptively
and highly addictive game.


390
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:48,846
It draws you in again and
again because of that.


391
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:52,396
And it stands out for its
beautiful understated UI.


392
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:56,266
It's got simple gestures,
subtle animations,


393

and a really restrained

and OpenGL ES extensively.

They had four days or
less to work on it.

us about themselves.

that we wanted to show some

You must be Puck.


532
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,226
Nice to meet you.


533
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:17,026
Congratulations.

>> How you doing?


535
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:19,256
>> Congrats you.


536
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:19,596
Are you Louis?


537
00:25:19,716 --> 00:25:20,986
We're going to start with you.


538
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:25,446
These three did some pretty
impressive work and we'd


539
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:26,576
like to tell you about them now.


540
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:27,506
>> Stand here.


541
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,246
>> Let's start with
Louis Harboe,


542
00:25:29,636 --> 00:25:30,776
in the middle here I believe.


543
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:33,496
Louis is 17 years old and
attends the University


544
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:35,056
of Chicago's Laboratory
High School.


545
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:39,336
>> Louis began developing
on iOS in the seventh grade,


546
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,656
and he's already collaborated
on several apps in the App Store


547
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,676
that have been featured in the


548
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,526
"Chicago Sun-Times"
and on "Cult of Mac."


549
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,726
His WWDC Scholarship App,
which you're seeing here


550
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:51,426
on screen scrolling through it,
is called "My Adventure book,"


551
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:55,086
and it presents a scrolling
list of photos and videos


552
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:58,196
that tell the story or
provide details about his apps,


553
00:25:58,496 --> 00:26:01,936
his education, his experiences,
his friends, his family,


554
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:04,966
and etc. You tap on each
one of these, they expand


555
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,066
and provide more detail.


556
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:09,736
And Louis also interned
at Square recently here


557
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,636
in San Francisco, and this tab,


558
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:13,746
this little photo right
there, tells you that.


559
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:17,026
So pretty amazing stuff
for four days of work.


560
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:17,976
Congratulations, Louis.

562
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:27,396
>> Next, let's look at
Bryan Keller's work.


563
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:30,176
Brian's 19 years old, attends
Marist College in New York,


564
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:33,236
and is studying computer
science.


565
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:36,936
>> So Bryan is really extremely
passionate about programming


566
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:39,816
and he's got an app in the App
Store today called "Augmentative


567
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:41,136
and Alternative Communication."


568
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:44,236
And he believes that
technology should be intuitive


569
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:44,906
and approachable.


570
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:48,276
And the app that you're seeing
right here is just named


571
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:48,976
"Bryan Keller."


572
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:50,726
It's not available in the App
Store -- none of theirs is --


573
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:55,046
but it presents a word cloud
that could be tapped and zoomed


574
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:59,166
to reveal details about his
apps, his family, his life,


575
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,006
his school, his sports,
and his interests.


576
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:03,966
And we picked it because it
had hockey I think is one


577
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:04,896
of the words, right?


578
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:05,826
No. Kidding.


579
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:06,976
We picked up it because
we liked it.


580
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,116
>> So that's Bryan's app.


581
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:09,976

And finally, Puck Meerburg.


585
00:27:19,226 --> 00:27:20,616
Puck is 13 years old.


586
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,856
He's from Delft in the
Netherlands, and he loves


587
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,146
to code, as you will see.


588
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:29,056
>> So pay close attention
here, okay.


589
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:32,756
Puck learned HTML, PHP, and
JavaScript when he was six,


590
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:37,136
all right; he's been recognized
as the Internet Hero of 2011


591
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:40,496
by the VNN, a Dutch television
network; he's presented


592
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:45,206
at TEDx Amsterdam when he was
11; and he's released ten apps


593
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,786
on the App Store already


594
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:51,366
that have been downloaded
200,000 times.

00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:02,426
I mean, the app that you're
seeing behind me is his WWDC

00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:06,316
submission called WWDC, and
it uses UIKit, Core Animation,


599
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:09,176
Multi-Touch, Core Graphics to
present a comprehensive resume


600
00:28:09,176 --> 00:28:10,356
of his life and interests.

on these clouds,
dragging them around.
