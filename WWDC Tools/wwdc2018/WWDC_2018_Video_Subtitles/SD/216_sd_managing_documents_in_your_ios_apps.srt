[ Applause ]


3
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:23,976
>> Good morning.


4
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,136
Good morning, and welcome to


5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,306
Managing Documents In Your iOS


6
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:29,756
Apps.


7
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:32,436
I'm Brandon Tennant, a software


8
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:33,446
engineer here at Apple and the


9
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:34,736
Document Management team.


10
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,276
And, later I'll be joined by my


11
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,206
colleagues Thomas Deniau and


12
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:38,786
Rony Fadel.


13
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,476
So, today we're going to give


14
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,316
you an overview of what document


15
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:45,076
management on iOS is.


16
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:46,286
And, then we'll share a few new


17
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:47,246
things in this area.


18
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:49,576
Then, Thomas will come up on


19
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:51,966
stage to show you how to use the


20
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,806
Document Management API in your


21
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:54,236
apps.


22
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,886
And, finally, Rony will join us


23
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:58,576
onstage to show you a few tips


24
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:00,136
and tricks for raising the bar


25
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,256
in your application.


26
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,385
So, let's get started with a


27
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:05,686
refresher about what document


28
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,026
management on iOS is.


29
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:09,206
It's a collection of


30
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:10,096
technologies.


31
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,846
First, there's an API for


32
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,056
application developers.


33
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:15,206
For cloud vendors, there's also


34
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:16,286
the File Provider API.


35
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:19,406
And, there's also the Files app.


36
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:22,976
In iOS 11, we introduced


37
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,766
UIDocumentBrowserViewController.


38
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,686
And, also significantly revamped


39
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:28,266
UIDocumentPickerViewController.


40
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,406
Using this new controller in


41
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,776
your app, your customers will be


42
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:35,186
able to manage and browse their


43
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,716
files from all of their favorite


44
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:37,466
cloud vendors.


45
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,836
There's also powerful Search


46
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:41,146
that searches across all of


47
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:42,046
these cloud vendors.


48
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,236
They'll be able to favorite


49
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,276
Folders, and those favorite


50
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:47,036
Folders will appear in the


51
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:47,586
sidebar.


52
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:49,966
And, they'll be able to organize


53
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,946
their files using Tags.


54
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,196
Recently used files also appear


55
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:55,946
in the Recents tab.


56
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,316
So, by using


57
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:02,826
UIDocumentBrowserViewController


58
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,276
in your app, you'll be giving


59
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:05,796
your customers a consistent


60
00:02:05,796 --> 00:02:07,166
experience, by bringing all of


61
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,726
the power of Files into your


62
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:08,925
app.


63
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,026
It eliminates the need for you


64
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,036
to write your own document


65
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:12,416
browser.


66
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:15,686
This allows you to focus on


67
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:16,846
perfecting the experience your


68
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,966
customers will have when viewing


69
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,226
or editing documents in your


70
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:20,566
app.


71
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:23,516
To get started with this, see


72
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:24,916
last year's session, "Building


73
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,636
Great Document-based Apps in


74
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:28,566
iOS."


75
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:31,556
There's also API for cloud


76
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:32,096
vendors.


77
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,016
This is called the File Provider


78
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:35,306
API.


79
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,506
You use this to write file


80
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,576
provider extensions, and also


81
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:42,196
custom UI actions, including the


82
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,656
account sign-in screen.


83
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,466
For application developers, you


84
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:48,826
don't need to use this API for


85
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,246
people to access your files.


86
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:53,586
So, when you write a file


87
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,086
provider extension, it will


88
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,336
appear in the Files app, and in


89
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:58,296
UIDocumentBrowserView


90
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,256
Controllers, under the Locations


91
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,616
tab-- under the Locations


92
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:01,896
section.


93
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:06,526
Also, because sign-in is


94
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:07,746
implemented using FPUI


95
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:09,596
ActionExtensionViewController,


96
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:11,646
you'll want to use this so you


97
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:12,646
can reduce friction for your


98
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,306
customers by making logging into


99
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:15,206
your service easier.


100
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,206
Let's go through a few examples


101
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:19,696
of that.


102
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,126
First, in this example, what you


103
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:24,136
can do-- or, what the user is


104
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,796
able to do, is sign into their


105
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,016
service, without being


106
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,286
interrupted from their workflow.


107
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:29,196
They don't have to leave the


108
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:29,456
app.


109
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,566
They can just sign in and


110
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,616
continue going along their


111
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:32,326
business.


112
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,056
An example of what to try and


113
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:37,066
avoid, would be something like


114
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:39,096
this, where there's redundant UI


115
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,576
elements or branding onscreen.


116
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:41,766
You can see the example of two


117
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,516
nav bars, or two Cancel buttons.


118
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,216
And, another example to try and


119
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:48,906
avoid, is having a simple Sign


120
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:50,616
In button, where all it does is


121
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,186
launch to your application.


122
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,116
This interrupts the customer's


123
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:54,656
workflow.


124
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:58,256
So, try to avoid doing that.


125
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:00,136
Lastly, we've seen great


126
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,186
adoption from all of you


127
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:02,996
developers and cloud vendors


128
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,046
over the course of the last


129
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:04,246
year.


130
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:05,996
So, there's a lot of


131
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:06,966
applications that use this


132
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:07,826
technology already.


133
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,166
So, now is a great time to try


134
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:10,686
adopting


135
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,236
UIDocumentBrowserViewController


136
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:13,536
in your application today.


137
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:15,516
And, if you're a cloud vendor


138
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:17,396
that hasn't yet already provided


139
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:18,946
a file provider extension, now's


140
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:19,805
the time to do so.


141
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:23,036
So, let's talk about a few new


142
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:23,836
things.


143
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:26,636
First, for cloud vendors, we've


144
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:28,956
seen some of the difficulties in


145
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:29,956
making a file provider


146
00:04:29,956 --> 00:04:30,586
extension.


147
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:32,056
And, what we're happy to


148
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:33,396
announce today is there's a new


149
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,036
tool for you.


150
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:35,126
It's called the File


151
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,586
Provider-Validation tool.


152
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:39,486
This tool will guide you-- will


153
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:41,376
help-- will run tests, and show


154
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,376
you the issues with your file


155
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,606
provider extension, and guide


156
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:44,836
you towards fixing those.


157
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:46,466
It's available for download


158
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,206
today from developer.apple.com.


159
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:49,886
And, when you download it,


160
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,876
you'll get a couple of things.


161
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:53,746
You're going to get a set of


162
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,056
source files that you'll need to


163
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,196
add to your file provider


164
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,666
extension project, and an iOS


165
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,426
application to install and run


166
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:01,306
on your iPad.


167
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:04,506
Once you've modified your file


168
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:07,076
provider project, installed the


169
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,486
app on your iPad, and run it,


170
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:09,876
you'll be greeted with a screen


171
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,446
that looks like this.


172
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,056
Your file provider will be


173
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:14,106
listed-- will be shown on the


174
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,566
left side, and when you tap


175
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:16,886
that, there'a Run button that


176
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,676
you can press to run our full


177
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,346
suite of tests against your file


178
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:21,136
provider extension.


179
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:23,106
When you've done that, you'll


180
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,786
see a list of successes and


181
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:25,466
failures.


182
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:26,846
You'll want to tap on the


183
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:29,446
failure to dig deeper, and find


184
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:30,376
the issues in your code.


185
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:32,056
We'll be able to help you


186
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:33,676
through this at the labs on


187
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:36,956
Thursday and Friday.


188
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:40,656
Also, an exciting new thing this


189
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,286
year announced was Siri


190
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:43,096
shortcuts.


191
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:43,996
And, we're happy to say that


192
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:45,946
Siri shortcuts are coming to


193
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,386
file provider extensions.


194
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,136
What this does, is it surfaces


195
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:52,306
recently used documents that


196
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,116
were opened or created, and it


197
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:55,326
makes them visible either in


198
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:57,896
Search or on the Lock Screen.


199
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:00,736
You'll also be able to-- your


200
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:01,796
customer will also be able to


201
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,076
make shortcuts that are synced


202
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:05,096
across devices.


203
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,436
And, it's important to note that


204
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:07,686
they're synced across devices,


205
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,526
because in order to support


206
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,396
this, your file provider will


207
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:14,376
need to use unique identifiers


208
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:16,656
for each file across all of the


209
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,616
devices for a given customer.


210
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,266
If this is true, or you can make


211
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,976
this happen, all you need to do


212
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:24,456
to support Siri shortcuts in


213
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:26,366
your file provider extension is


214
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,986
to add NSFileProvider


215
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,136
UsesUniqueItemIdentifiers


216
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,296
AcrossDevices to your file


217
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,076
provider extension's info.plist


218
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:34,406
file.


219
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:36,026
Once you've done that, and


220
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:37,646
submitted to the Store, you're


221
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:37,846
done.


222
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:40,476
For application developers,


223
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:41,416
there's nothing you need to do.


224
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,196
For information about Siri


225
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,736
shortcuts, check out yesterday's


226
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,246
session, "Introduction to Siri


227
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:47,836
Shortcuts."


228
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:54,176
Also this year, we're happy to


229
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:55,256
announce that we're releasing


230
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,426
the Particle Sample app.


231
00:06:57,206 --> 00:06:58,196
This was sample code that we


232
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,516
used in last year's session to


233
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:00,516
demonstrate how to use


234
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:01,916
UIDocumentBrowserViewController


235
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,056
in your app.


236
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,826
It looks like this, and it uses


237
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,836
UIDocumentBrowserViewController


238
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,416
as its main viewController.


239
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,546
It defines a file format.


240
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:17,046
It implements state restoration,


241
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:20,056
and imports assets using


242
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:21,796
UIDocumentPickerViewController.


243
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:24,326
You'll be able to download this


244
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:24,676
today.


245
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:27,266
The link is available in the WW


246
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,436
app, and you'll also be able to


247
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:29,226
search for it online.


248
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,656
And, that's Particles.


249
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:34,636
So, with that, I'd like to


250
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:35,976
introduce Thomas onto the stage.


251
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:41,546
[ Applause ]


252
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:42,676
>> Hello, everyone.


253
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:44,856
I'm Thomas, a software engineer


254
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:45,916
on the Documents Management


255
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,136
team.


256
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:47,796
And, I'm going to take you


257
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:49,806
through how you can leverage the


258
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,706
document management features of


259
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,026
iOS in your app.


260
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:56,836
Together, we're going to discuss


261
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,536
what the Document Picker and


262
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:01,686
Document Browser are, when and


263
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:02,476
how to use them.


264
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,356
Then, we'll add a document


265
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,786
picker to our demo app,


266
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:07,676
Particles.


267
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,266
And, finally, we talk about


268
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,016
document types, and how to


269
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:14,376
configure them properly in


270
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:14,696
Xcode.


271
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,936
So, what does interacting with


272
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:21,146
documents mean nowadays?


273
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,766
Of course, it means that you


274
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,926
need to provide UI to let your


275
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:28,816
customers organize their


276
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:29,356
documents.


277
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:31,816
Starting with the ones in your


278
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:32,246
app container.


279
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,846
But, because most documents are


280
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,265
in the cloud nowadays, it means


281
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,556
that you need to let them access


282
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,246
documents stored in the cloud,


283
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:43,946
and in other apps.


284
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,346
How do you do this?


285
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:50,026
Well, we have two solutions for


286
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:50,196
you.


287
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:53,336
The Document Picker and the


288
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,136
Document Browser.


289
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:56,936
What are the differences between


290
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,936
these two?


291
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:02,956
Well, both let you browse files


292
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,606
stored locally on your iOS


293
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,466
device, and in various cloud


294
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:06,946
services.


295
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,166
And, both let you access files


296
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,796
from other apps.


297
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:15,746
However, they have different use


298
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:16,076
cases.


299
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,186
You [inaudible] Document Picker


300
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,286
shortly, for a short period of


301
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:23,496
time, for a quick user


302
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,906
interaction with the files you


303
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:26,566
want to reach.


304
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,906
The Document Browser, on the


305
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:32,636
other hand, is supposed to be


306
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,846
the main document browsing UI of


307
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:35,906
your app.


308
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,916
Let's start with the Document


309
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:41,146
Browser.


310
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,986
As Brandon mentioned, the


311
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,536
document browser is what you see


312
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:49,956
when you launch any of the UI


313
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:50,876
applications.


314
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:54,136
If your app is document-based,


315
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,206
you should probably use a


316
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,126
document browser to display


317
00:09:58,126 --> 00:09:58,786
these documents.


318
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:01,686
And, if you choose to do so,


319
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:04,026
this is what your customers will


320
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,266
see when they launch your app.


321
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,796
They immediately get to the


322
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:11,796
files, which is what matters.


323
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,756
The Document Browser is full


324
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:17,236
screen, and it lets your


325
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,506
customers open and organize the


326
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:21,496
documents that your app handles.


327
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:26,966
As Brandon mentioned, it has all


328
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,206
the features of the Files app.


329
00:10:29,556 --> 00:10:32,326
So, Search, Tags, Favorites,


330
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:34,546
Recents, all of this comes for


331
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,226
free, and we do all of the


332
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:36,976
editing for you.


333
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:43,966
It can be customized with your


334
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,096
own buttons, such as the


335
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,116
[inaudible] button in the top


336
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:50,696
right corner, or to match your


337
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:51,486
application's look.


338
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:53,986
As you can see, numbers and


339
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,106
keynote look very different, yet


340
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,206
both are based on the Document


341
00:10:58,206 --> 00:10:59,036
Browser controller.


342
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,856
Of course, once your customer


343
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:05,096
opens a document, you get to


344
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:08,186
present your own UI on top of


345
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,076
the browser to present your


346
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:11,576
documentation UI for example.


347
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:13,866
Now, because the Document


348
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:15,466
Browser is the entry point of


349
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,996
your app, it is best to make it


350
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:18,916
the root view controller.


351
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,996
However, we got a lot of


352
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:23,616
feedback over the last year from


353
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,696
you, saying it was not always


354
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:27,216
easy to make it the root view


355
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:27,626
controller.


356
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:31,116
If that is the case, we want to


357
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,786
clarify the guideline we gave


358
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:33,246
last year.


359
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,556
The Document Browser can also be


360
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,016
presented [inaudible] full


361
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:41,736
screen, likely shortly after


362
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:41,976
launch.


363
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,956
However, it is still meant to be


364
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,466
the starting point of your app.


365
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,806
In document-based apps, what we


366
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:52,506
should see first are the


367
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:52,976
documents.


368
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:58,286
So, we do not recommend making


369
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:01,366
it possible to get out of the


370
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:01,996
browser.


371
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,686
If you think you need to hide


372
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,816
the browser, maybe what you


373
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:09,586
might be looking for is Document


374
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:10,506
Picker, which we are going to


375
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,686
discuss next.


376
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:16,156
How to get started with a new


377
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:18,296
Document Browser controller.


378
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:19,806
You can start a new app in


379
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,676
Xcode, and use the


380
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:23,006
document-based app template.


381
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:26,016
And, this template gives you


382
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:27,496
Document Browser [inaudible]


383
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,116
based app.


384
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,286
If you have an existing app, and


385
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:32,576
want to add a


386
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:34,226
DocumentBrowserViewController to


387
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,946
it, you can drag a Document


388
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:39,336
Browser to your storyboard, and


389
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:41,266
use the Initial View Controller


390
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:41,976
checkbox in Xcode.


391
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:48,966
Once you have the Document


392
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,326
Browser controller, you can


393
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:50,846
customize it.


394
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,096
You can add your own buttons to


395
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:55,496
the bars and menus.


396
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:58,966
And, you can set your own colors


397
00:12:58,966 --> 00:12:59,876
and themes to match your app's


398
00:12:59,876 --> 00:12:59,966
look.


399
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:07,356
You can also customize the open


400
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:08,796
and close document animations so


401
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:10,436
that you get a nice zoom-in


402
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,016
transition from your document's


403
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,786
[inaudible] to your own document


404
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:14,376
addition UI.


405
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,136
To learn all about this, please


406
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:18,196
watch last year's session, where


407
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:19,986
we have covered this in detail.


408
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:24,776
And, as Brandon mentioned, we


409
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,906
have made the sample app that


410
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,816
session last year, available as


411
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:30,356
sample code today.


412
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,816
Now, the Document Picker is a


413
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:36,606
different thing.


414
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:40,896
You use it to let your customers


415
00:13:41,016 --> 00:13:42,986
open documents or assets stored


416
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:45,046
in the cloud, or stored in other


417
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,886
apps, but it is only shown to


418
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:49,626
let them choose a file, and then


419
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:50,226
it goes away.


420
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:53,576
The Document Picker is what we


421
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:54,236
use in Mail.


422
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,686
When you want to attach a file


423
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:00,316
to an email, you tap the Add


424
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,816
Attachment button, and this


425
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:03,526
sheet pops up.


426
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:05,976
This is a document picker.


427
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:09,416
You choose a file to attach, and


428
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:11,236
the sheet goes away.


429
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:15,086
Same thing in iWork.


430
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:18,056
If you want to attach a PDF,


431
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:20,096
insert the PDF in your Pages


432
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:20,516
document.


433
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,736
You're going to tap this Insert


434
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,486
From button, and the same sheet


435
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:26,226
pops up.


436
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,506
You choose a file, it goes away.


437
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:31,436
So, if you need to display user


438
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:33,676
interface to let your customers


439
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:36,406
open-- view things from the


440
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:39,176
cloud, and then hide it once the


441
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,136
file is chosen, the Document


442
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,576
Picker is a great option for


443
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:42,726
you.


444
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:47,876
Why do we need to give you the


445
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:48,746
Document Picker?


446
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,156
Because as we have said,


447
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,096
documents might be in multiple


448
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:54,696
locations.


449
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,386
They can be in the cloud, or in


450
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:58,316
other app containers.


451
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,056
And, by default, you do not add


452
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:03,576
access to these.


453
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:06,226
So, you need something to let


454
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,586
you access, copy, and move


455
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,236
documents between these


456
00:15:10,236 --> 00:15:13,186
locations, and this is what the


457
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:16,986
Document Picker does.


458
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:19,676
It goes away once the files get


459
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,756
chosen, so if you want something


460
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,566
which stays onscreen for a long


461
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:24,986
time, you should check out


462
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:25,916
Document Browser instead.


463
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,916
What can you do with Document


464
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,136
Picker?


465
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:35,156
You can use it for multiple


466
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:35,466
things.


467
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:38,216
You can use it to access files


468
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:39,466
in the cloud directly.


469
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:45,646
Now, creating copies, you can


470
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:50,106
use it to move files to the


471
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,366
cloud to implement a safety


472
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:52,956
cloud feature.


473
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:56,556
And, getting copies of documents


474
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:59,106
is often confusing, but if you


475
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:00,896
really want to, you can use it


476
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:04,536
to copy things from and to the


477
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:04,796
cloud.


478
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,506
So, let's say we want to let our


479
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,646
customers access a movie they've


480
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:15,646
stored in the cloud.


481
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,076
This is a great use of Document


482
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:18,746
Picker controller.


483
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,626
You create a Document Picker


484
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:23,426
controller, and you specify the


485
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,566
types of file you want your


486
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:26,776
users to choose as a first


487
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:27,306
document.


488
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,666
And, the second document is one


489
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,806
of the constants we have


490
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:34,276
described on the previous slide.


491
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,046
Then, you set the Document


492
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:38,026
Picker delegate, because this is


493
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:41,446
how we get notified that your


494
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,106
customer has chosen their file,


495
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:45,866
and you present it.


496
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:49,376
Once the file is chosen, you're


497
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,296
going to get called back at this


498
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,976
delegate method.


499
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:55,296
You get [inaudible] of your


500
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:56,766
files in this method.


501
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:58,586
You can use them directly.


502
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:03,196
And, [inaudible] single URL,


503
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,236
because there's a property you


504
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:07,646
can set in the Picker to let


505
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,566
your customer choose multiple


506
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:11,185
files at once.


507
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:17,156
So, let's go ahead and add a


508
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,286
Document Picker to our demo app,


509
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,886
Particles, from last year.


510
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,516
This is the app [inaudible] last


511
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:28,626
year.


512
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,316
It is based on the Document


513
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,066
Browser to let me choose a file


514
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:32,486
to open.


515
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:35,116
As you can see, I have Recents,


516
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,876
I have Tags, I have Search, I


517
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,866
have Browse to list all my


518
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:39,276
sources.


519
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:41,136
All of this comes for free.


520
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:44,976
Now, I can go ahead and open


521
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:48,006
this file, and I can tweak this


522
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:49,536
nice particle system.


523
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:53,586
Now, my customers love this app.


524
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:56,546
But, they would like to make the


525
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:59,906
particles a little nicer.


526
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:02,386
So, they've asked the designers


527
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:03,926
to design some better-looking


528
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,586
particle images, and the


529
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,336
designers have shared these


530
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,476
images over iCloud.


531
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:11,456
So, how do we get these images


532
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:12,496
to customize them?


533
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:15,726
What we're going to do, is add a


534
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:17,146
Choose Image button in the


535
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,866
navigation bar here to pick a


536
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,546
file from iCloud, and customize


537
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:23,496
these particles.


538
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:26,476
So, you can open your


539
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:29,246
storyboard, and here I am


540
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:29,946
[inaudible] the controller.


541
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:32,306
I'm going to drag a new bar


542
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,966
button item to that editor.


543
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,896
And, I'm going to animate Choose


544
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:44,846
Image.


545
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:51,526
[inaudible] Choose Image.


546
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:54,586
OK. Now, I get to write some


547
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:59,206
code to present to the document


548
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,696
picker of the controller.


549
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:05,956
So, I can drag an action from my


550
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:10,036
button to the source code, and I


551
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:11,996
agree to call it Choose Image,


552
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:13,976
and [inaudible].


553
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:14,986
Connect.


554
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:17,546
And, now I have twice my code.


555
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:20,406
So, let me display this in a


556
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:21,976
bigger window.


557
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:27,976
Here I am in my chooseImage


558
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:28,556
method.


559
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:31,396
I'm going first to create a


560
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:32,696
Document Picker controller.


561
00:19:32,776 --> 00:19:34,826
And, I specify the type of files


562
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:36,006
I want my customers to choose.


563
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:38,426
So, here this is UTTypeImage,


564
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,666
and the mode.


565
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:42,306
I'm using .import here because I


566
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,896
want to embed the particle image


567
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:45,536
in my document.


568
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:48,696
But, in many cases, you will use


569
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:49,316
[inaudible] here instead.


570
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:54,256
You set your document picker


571
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,056
delegate, and you present it.


572
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,986
When the Document Picker gets


573
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,796
invoked, and the file is chosen,


574
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:03,976
it going to call you back.


575
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:06,296
So, we need to implement the


576
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,106
document picker [inaudible] at


577
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:07,436
method.


578
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:10,516
I don't know if you noticed, but


579
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:14,136
I have not set a property to


580
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,416
choose document files.


581
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,006
So, I'm going to check I have


582
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:22,046
only one URL here.


583
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:27,016
Get the first URL, and create an


584
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,306
image from it.


585
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,756
And, set it in our particle


586
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:32,976
system, which is [inaudible].


587
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:36,156
Let's run this again.


588
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,796
It [inaudible] my app and will


589
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:40,976
open my simulator shortly.


590
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:48,566
So, here I am.


591
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:49,976
I am in my simulator.


592
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,076
I can open my file.


593
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:52,716
And, I have this new Choose


594
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:55,216
Image button in my navigation


595
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:55,426
bar.


596
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:58,236
I can tap it, and my Document


597
00:20:58,236 --> 00:20:59,446
Picker comes up.


598
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,136
And, as you see, again, we have


599
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,006
all the pictures of the Files


600
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:02,296
app.


601
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:03,286
We can search our files, you


602
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:03,926
have Tags.


603
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,476
You can browse.


604
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:07,696
All of this comes for free.


605
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:12,146
Now, my particle image is


606
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,066
[inaudible] shared to me over


607
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,576
iCloud, so they show up in


608
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:15,536
[inaudible].


609
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,686
And, again, use this little star


610
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,166
image here.


611
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,376
Pick it, and my particles are


612
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:21,976
little stars.


613
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:28,616
[ Applause ]


614
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:30,126
This was easy.


615
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:32,646
And, when you are back at work,


616
00:21:32,646 --> 00:21:33,816
you will be able to add a


617
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:36,136
Document Picker to your app in


618
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:36,796
no time.


619
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,836
It simply has very little code,


620
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:41,806
and does not depend on any


621
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:42,736
third-party library.


622
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:45,416
Your customers simply get access


623
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,356
to their files, no matter where


624
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:47,916
they are stored.


625
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:51,116
Now, you noticed that during the


626
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:52,996
demo, we have again talked about


627
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:53,536
file types.


628
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,596
And, many among you probably


629
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,866
don't know what these are.


630
00:21:57,246 --> 00:22:01,296
So, let's talk about file types.


631
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,126
Document Types let the system


632
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,706
know which files your


633
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,516
application knows how to handle.


634
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:12,176
And, they're important because


635
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:16,376
they let iOS open your app when


636
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,706
the file is tapped in the Files


637
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:17,916
app.


638
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:21,456
They also let it show your app


639
00:22:21,596 --> 00:22:22,406
in the Share sheet.


640
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:26,436
And, finally it lets iOS choose


641
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:27,476
the proper icon for your


642
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:27,976
documents.


643
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:30,626
So, if I configure my types


644
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:32,336
properly, and if I want to


645
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:34,236
[inaudible] extension, I'm going


646
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,406
to see this when browsing


647
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:36,586
particles files in the Files


648
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:37,426
app.


649
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:40,606
If I don't, I'm going to see


650
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,456
this instead, which is not too


651
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:44,236
good, and my customers won't be


652
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:45,646
able to open my files from the


653
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:46,056
Files app.


654
00:22:47,256 --> 00:22:48,386
So, let's configure this


655
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:48,856
together.


656
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,006
There are two steps when you


657
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:54,666
want to configure document


658
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,036
types.


659
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,376
You need to declare the type


660
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,986
first, if it is not declared by


661
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,936
iOS already, and then you need


662
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:04,216
to claim it to tell iOS you can


663
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,486
view or edit files of this type.


664
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,726
Let's start with type


665
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:10,326
declaration.


666
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,056
The first question you need to


667
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:15,106
ask yourself is, do you need to


668
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:15,616
declare it?


669
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:19,146
Because in most cases, you'll be


670
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:20,666
dealing with common file types,


671
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:23,316
such as videos, images, PDFs,


672
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:24,896
presentations, spreadsheets.


673
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:28,226
If that is the case, iOS most


674
00:23:28,226 --> 00:23:30,276
likely already declared this for


675
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:30,416
you.


676
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:32,626
And, to know if this is the


677
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:35,056
case, you can check out the


678
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:37,846
documentation at this short URL.


679
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:42,996
If that is the case, great, you


680
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:45,386
do not have anything to do, and


681
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:47,106
you can jump to claiming the


682
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:47,746
type.


683
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,276
The other common case, is when


684
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:55,326
you wrote an app which defines


685
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:56,756
its own file format.


686
00:23:57,856 --> 00:23:58,996
You invented your own file


687
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:00,716
format, and you get to define


688
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:01,546
what that type is.


689
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:03,716
Then you should declare your


690
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:06,406
type as exported, which tells


691
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,986
iOS you are the authority for


692
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:10,166
this file type.


693
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:14,316
This is a situation I'm in, in


694
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:17,536
the Files app-- in the Particles


695
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:18,816
app, sorry.


696
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:21,676
My particles file format is my


697
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:21,956
own.


698
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:25,976
So, I can open Xcode to


699
00:24:25,976 --> 00:24:29,346
configure this type.


700
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,996
And, in this exported UI


701
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,346
section, which lets me edit my


702
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:37,176
info.plist, I specify the type


703
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,516
identifier, which is a


704
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:40,446
[inaudible] string that I


705
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:40,846
choose.


706
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:42,696
So, [inaudible] comes the


707
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:44,766
example that [inaudible] sample


708
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:50,026
code, the particles, and I need


709
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:51,276
to declare a list of parent


710
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:53,186
types in the Conforms To field.


711
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:58,356
What are parent types?


712
00:24:58,536 --> 00:25:01,406
Well, types form a tree, which


713
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:02,946
we call the [inaudible] tree,


714
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:08,276
and you can think of it like a


715
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:09,196
[inaudible], like Swift.


716
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:13,856
For example, JPEG images and


717
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:17,006
HEIF images are both kinds of


718
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:17,556
images.


719
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:21,116
And, .image conforms to our root


720
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,536
type for user-created, or


721
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:26,156
user-visible, documents, which


722
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:29,976
is called public.content.


723
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:31,416
Now, public.content has other


724
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,366
children, like, for example,


725
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,166
public.spreadsheet.


726
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:38,666
You can find this list of types


727
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:41,566
in the documentation I pointed


728
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:42,586
to earlier.


729
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:43,776
Now, we need to find a spot in


730
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:44,866
this tree for my type,


731
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:45,706
Particles.


732
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:49,186
Since the particle system is not


733
00:25:49,296 --> 00:25:51,916
a common file category, there is


734
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,516
no [inaudible] category for me.


735
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:55,736
So, I can't just make it conform


736
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:58,786
to public.content directly.


737
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:00,226
And, I need to conform to


738
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,196
public.content either directly,


739
00:26:02,506 --> 00:26:03,786
or indirectly through


740
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:06,326
public.spreadsheet or .image if


741
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:07,956
I want my files to show up in


742
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:11,616
Recents and in Search.


743
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:13,766
Then you have a second tree,


744
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,446
which we call the physical tree,


745
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:17,706
which lets iOS know how the


746
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,316
files are represented on-disk.


747
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,706
And, here this is much simpler,


748
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:23,556
because you only have two


749
00:26:23,556 --> 00:26:23,926
choices.


750
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:27,556
In most cases, you will be


751
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:29,286
dealing with a single file on


752
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,496
disk for your document.


753
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:35,956
If you need to group multiple


754
00:26:35,956 --> 00:26:38,446
resources together, and you have


755
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:40,446
the file package, you're going


756
00:26:40,446 --> 00:26:42,006
to use com.apple.package.


757
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:43,536
But, in most cases, you have a


758
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,576
single file disk, so it's


759
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:45,926
public.data.


760
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,146
This is because I am in with


761
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:50,846
particles, so I'm going to


762
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:52,156
conform to public.data.


763
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:55,936
Now, because this is a tree,


764
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:58,666
.data and .package both iterate


765
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,786
from our root type from the


766
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,206
physical hierarchy, which is


767
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,366
public.item.


768
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:06,566
But, you don't care about this,


769
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:08,476
you just need to choose between


770
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:10,546
.data and .package.


771
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,126
Therefore, you have two parents,


772
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:14,536
public.data and public.content.


773
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:17,756
So, in my Xcode UI, I'm going to


774
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:20,266
write, Conforms To public.data,


775
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,726
public.content.


776
00:27:22,196 --> 00:27:26,336
The last thing I need to do is


777
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:28,966
tell iOS which file extensions


778
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:31,786
are associated with my type.


779
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:35,046
This is how iOS will know that


780
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:37,086
.particles files are of the type


781
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:37,796
[inaudible] defined.


782
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:41,326
To do this, I add a UTType


783
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:44,836
classification property to my


784
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:45,786
[inaudible] properties.


785
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:50,036
In this dictionary, I add a key


786
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:50,316
called


787
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,436
public.filename-extension, and


788
00:27:53,436 --> 00:27:55,286
[inaudible] file extension that


789
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,466
you want to associate with your


790
00:27:58,756 --> 00:27:58,926
type.


791
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,516
So, here I have a new item, of


792
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:01,996
particles.


793
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:06,396
And, with this, our declaration


794
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:07,286
is done.


795
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,176
There's just one more thing I


796
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:11,876
didn't mention.


797
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:15,786
It is if you-- if this was the


798
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:18,466
case where we were declaring our


799
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:19,056
own type.


800
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:21,026
But, you might also want to use


801
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:22,306
type defined by another


802
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:22,926
application.


803
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:26,286
If that is the case, you also


804
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:28,616
need to declare the type so that


805
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:30,706
iOS knows about it, in case that


806
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:31,596
app is not [inaudible].


807
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:34,486
And, because this is an imported


808
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:39,096
type declaration, this means


809
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,856
that if iOS finds an extra


810
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,956
definition of that type


811
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:44,856
somewhere else, it will prefer


812
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,366
that definition over yours.


813
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,826
This is also what you need to do


814
00:28:49,236 --> 00:28:50,606
if you want to use a common file


815
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,456
type which is not declared by


816
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,396
iOS yet.


817
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:55,736
Now, do not freak out, it is the


818
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,976
same UI as what we've just went


819
00:28:58,976 --> 00:29:02,136
through, except that it is in


820
00:29:02,136 --> 00:29:03,606
the imported section instead of


821
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:03,946
exported.


822
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,696
Once you have your type defined,


823
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:11,846
you can claim support for it,


824
00:29:12,256 --> 00:29:14,306
still in your info.plist, or the


825
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:14,966
Xcode UI.


826
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:19,996
To do this, you specify the type


827
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:21,336
identifier that you have


828
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:23,586
defined, and the only other


829
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:26,176
thing that you need to do is


830
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:27,276
define a rank.


831
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,596
And, this lets iOS know what to


832
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,476
do when you tap on the file and


833
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:34,276
multiple apps can open this


834
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:35,026
file.


835
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:38,606
For this, you have three


836
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:39,046
choices.


837
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:44,206
The first is if it is your own


838
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:44,646
file type.


839
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:46,496
You choose "owner."


840
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:48,316
And, to be clear, this should


841
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:50,396
only be used if you happen to


842
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:51,746
have invented your own file


843
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:52,586
type.


844
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:56,346
In most cases, you want to use


845
00:29:56,426 --> 00:30:00,386
"default," if you can edit files


846
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:02,466
of this type, or "alternate" if


847
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:03,996
you can read files of this type,


848
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:04,976
but not edit them.


849
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:09,786
And a list of [inaudible], rules


850
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:12,946
are different on macOS, so if


851
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:14,936
[inaudible] macOS up, please


852
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:17,166
check out this other short link.


853
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:21,756
When claiming support for a


854
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:23,716
type, please be as specific as


855
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:24,156
possible.


856
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:26,666
We have just claimed support for


857
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,076
a very specific file type, so


858
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:28,986
.particles file type.


859
00:30:29,616 --> 00:30:30,656
But you can also claim support


860
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,346
for categories, such as any


861
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,206
image using public.image.


862
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:37,396
This is fine, but you need to be


863
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:39,106
as specific as possible to make


864
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,106
your app show up exactly what it


865
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:41,826
needs to show up.


866
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,646
Do not claim support for


867
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,156
[inaudible] types such as


868
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:48,086
public.data or public.content,


869
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,076
because this will make your app


870
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:52,696
show up in places where your


871
00:30:52,696 --> 00:30:54,596
customers do not expect to see


872
00:30:54,596 --> 00:30:55,946
it, and it will confuse them.


873
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:01,366
So, what can you do with all of


874
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:02,006
this information?


875
00:31:02,506 --> 00:31:05,866
Well, first, if you have a need


876
00:31:05,936 --> 00:31:07,566
to access files in the cloud,


877
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:09,106
you should use the Document


878
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:10,336
Browser or Document Picker to


879
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:11,676
access these documents.


880
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:15,216
Most cloud vendors have adopted


881
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:18,836
our API's, so if you use one of


882
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,206
these viewControllers, your


883
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:21,976
customers will be able to access


884
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:23,866
their files no matter where they


885
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:24,186
are.


886
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:26,136
And, you do not have to write


887
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:28,256
code for each cloud vendor.


888
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,736
If you wrote your own custom


889
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:35,356
document browsing UI before iOS


890
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:37,666
11, now's a great time to switch


891
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:38,216
to


892
00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:39,556
UIDocumentBrowserViewController.


893
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,856
It is packed with features--


894
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:47,316
it's packed with features, so


895
00:31:47,316 --> 00:31:49,336
please let us do the hard work,


896
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:50,626
and just get all the features in


897
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:51,996
your app for free.


898
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:55,626
Finally, please make sure your


899
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,226
document types are configured in


900
00:31:57,226 --> 00:31:59,276
Xcode properly so that your app


901
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:02,386
shows up exactly where it needs


902
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:05,556
to be, and help customers find


903
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:05,676
it.


904
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:08,676
And with this, I'm going to hand


905
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,776
the stage over to my colleague


906
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:09,976
Ronny.


907
00:32:10,516 --> 00:32:15,576
[ Applause ]


908
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:16,846
>> Thank you, Thomas.


909
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,136
Hello, everyone.


910
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:20,026
I am Rony Fadel, a software


911
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:21,346
engineer on the Documents


912
00:32:21,346 --> 00:32:22,836
Management team.


913
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:25,306
So, Thomas has explained how


914
00:32:25,306 --> 00:32:27,256
easy it is to adopt a document


915
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:29,486
browser and document picker


916
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:30,946
API's in your app.


917
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:32,826
Now, that you've adopted these


918
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,586
API's, we'd like to cover some


919
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:36,526
best practices to make sure that


920
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,066
your app is a well-behaved


921
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:40,736
citizen on the iOS ecosystem,


922
00:32:41,196 --> 00:32:44,186
the day you submit it to the App


923
00:32:44,456 --> 00:32:44,856
Store.


924
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:46,906
So, now that we've implemented a


925
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,986
document browser-based app, or


926
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:51,596
added picker support, now we're


927
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:52,806
ready finally to pick some


928
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:53,366
documents.


929
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:56,146
Your app might want to access


930
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,816
documents directly, avoiding the


931
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:00,906
copies in import mode that


932
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:03,236
Thomas has described, or if you


933
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,506
want to edit your document


934
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:04,956
directly.


935
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,816
For this you'd need to invoke


936
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,076
the Picker in Open Mode.


937
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:11,096
In this example, we're in the


938
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:13,476
Particles app, and we've created


939
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:15,476
and presented a Picker in Open


940
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:15,726
Mode.


941
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:17,616
We're going to pick an image


942
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:19,146
file to change our particle


943
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:19,936
system's image.


944
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:23,936
Once we've picked a document, we


945
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,406
receive a callback at one of


946
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,686
these two delegate methods.


947
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:29,616
The first one, if we're picking


948
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:32,126
our document in the Browser, or


949
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,216
the second one if we're picking


950
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,916
it in the Picker, like our


951
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:36,326
example.


952
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:40,716
We see the document here, and we


953
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,466
see actually the Document Picker


954
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:46,076
here, serving our app the URL


955
00:33:46,076 --> 00:33:46,956
that we've just picked.


956
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:50,036
If we attempt to access the


957
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,536
document directly, we risk


958
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:53,756
running into a permissions


959
00:33:53,756 --> 00:33:53,976
error.


960
00:33:55,356 --> 00:33:57,036
Let's try to understand why this


961
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:57,546
could happen.


962
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:00,376
As you may know, your apps on


963
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:01,966
iOS are Sandbox.


964
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:04,666
The App Sandbox is a security


965
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:07,286
feature, whereas every app has


966
00:34:07,356 --> 00:34:09,426
unrestricted access to documents


967
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:12,126
in its own app container, and by


968
00:34:12,126 --> 00:34:14,896
default, access is restricted to


969
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:16,775
documents in other containers,


970
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,735
namely in other app containers


971
00:34:18,735 --> 00:34:20,196
and in cloud service containers.


972
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:23,636
So, this is a security feature


973
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:25,585
that guarantees that other apps


974
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,426
and processes don't just go


975
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:29,036
snooping around in your app


976
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:30,366
container, accessing your


977
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:31,016
documents.


978
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:33,166
And, always make sure that if


979
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,076
they do access them, access


980
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:37,815
these documents, that is done


981
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:39,126
with user consent.


982
00:34:40,636 --> 00:34:43,916
So, since access to documents in


983
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,656
other containers is restricted,


984
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:48,065
how can your app gain access to


985
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:49,466
these documents that your


986
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,485
customer has picked?


987
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:53,666
What we have to do, is to extend


988
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,476
our App Sandbox to include these


989
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:56,065
documents.


990
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:59,246
Here's again the URL returned by


991
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:00,266
the Browser or the Picker.


992
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:03,896
This URL has a security scoped


993
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,026
resource attached to it.


994
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:07,676
You can think of this resource


995
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:09,426
as a permissions token granted


996
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:11,246
to you by the system, and


997
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:13,126
accessing this token would allow


998
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:15,436
your app to access this


999
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:15,936
document.


1000
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:19,446
We can start accessing this


1001
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,096
document using the following URL


1002
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:21,646
API's.


1003
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:23,666
When we call


1004
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:25,826
startAccessingSecurityScoped


1005
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:28,576
Resource, your app gets access


1006
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:30,206
to this document, and so you can


1007
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:31,676
start displaying or editing the


1008
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:32,166
document.


1009
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,386
And, once you're done using it,


1010
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,796
the document, you should call


1011
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:38,806
the stopAccessingSecurityScoped


1012
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:40,516
Resource API on that URL.


1013
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:42,856
And, as you can see here, access


1014
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:44,686
is again restricted to that


1015
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,196
document.


1016
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:50,546
So, here's a simple recipe to


1017
00:35:50,546 --> 00:35:51,866
guarantee that you will always


1018
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,366
interact successfully with


1019
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,596
Sandbox documents.


1020
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:57,556
We walked through this example


1021
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:58,716
where we make these calls.


1022
00:35:59,996 --> 00:36:01,586
First, we make the


1023
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:03,716
startAccessing call on that URL,


1024
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:05,706
and so we can start interacting


1025
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:06,376
with that document.


1026
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:09,036
And, you notice in the defer


1027
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:10,856
block, we make the stopAccessing


1028
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,416
call once we're done using the


1029
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,886
document.


1030
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:16,576
You notice that these calls are


1031
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:19,476
balanced, and that we only call


1032
00:36:19,476 --> 00:36:21,946
stopAccessing if startAccessing


1033
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,116
returns "true."


1034
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:27,166
We keep resource access time as


1035
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,426
small as possible, because when


1036
00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:30,826
we make this startAccessing


1037
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:33,196
call, we consume limited system


1038
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:34,916
resources, reserved just for


1039
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:35,266
your app.


1040
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,276
And so, we need to relinquish


1041
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:39,136
these resources once we're done


1042
00:36:39,136 --> 00:36:40,696
using that document to make sure


1043
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:43,066
that we can access additional


1044
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:45,496
documents within our process.


1045
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,116
If you know for sure that this


1046
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:50,906
document exists inside of your


1047
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:52,626
app container, you do not need


1048
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,436
to make these calls.


1049
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:56,376
But, in case of doubt, make


1050
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:57,036
these calls.


1051
00:36:57,736 --> 00:36:59,196
If they're not actually needed,


1052
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:01,126
they'll simply be a no-op.


1053
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:05,336
Great. Now, we know how to gain


1054
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:06,626
access to our documents.


1055
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,816
We can go ahead and pick that


1056
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:10,396
document, like the particle


1057
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,386
image in our example.


1058
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:14,466
And, start accessing it.


1059
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,316
As you can see here, the cloud


1060
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:17,726
service that is hosting this


1061
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,706
document, as well as other apps


1062
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:21,606
also can access this document,


1063
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:23,716
and sometimes concurrently with


1064
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:24,966
your app.


1065
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:26,746
What we need here is a


1066
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:29,046
system-wide mechanism to make


1067
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,396
sure that access to this


1068
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:32,166
document is always coordinated,


1069
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:34,326
so that processes don't go


1070
00:37:34,326 --> 00:37:35,666
stepping on each other's feet,


1071
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:38,236
accessing, reading, and writing


1072
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:39,466
to this document.


1073
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,806
On iOS, this mechanism is called


1074
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:46,076
file coordination, and it is


1075
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:47,276
exposed via the


1076
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:48,956
NSFileCoordinator and


1077
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,486
NSFilePresenter API's.


1078
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,316
It acts as a system-wide


1079
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:55,166
multiple reader/single writer


1080
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,546
lock, and it's also the way for


1081
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,506
your app to instruct the system


1082
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:02,576
to download this document if


1083
00:38:02,576 --> 00:38:03,886
it's not available locally.


1084
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:05,856
Because as you may know, a lot


1085
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:07,306
of these documents could be in


1086
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:08,606
the cloud, and not on the


1087
00:38:08,606 --> 00:38:09,136
device.


1088
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:12,566
So, you might find yourself


1089
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:14,496
writing a lot of boilerplate and


1090
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:16,056
error-prone code to handle


1091
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:17,896
sandboxing, to handle file


1092
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:18,756
coordination.


1093
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,556
If you're simply interested in


1094
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:23,456
displaying and editing your


1095
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:25,456
documents, the solution is much


1096
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:25,936
simpler.


1097
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:27,986
And, on iOS, it comes in the


1098
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:29,376
form of UIDocument.


1099
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:32,006
UIDocument has been available


1100
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:32,956
since iOS 5.


1101
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:36,016
It is the recommended way for


1102
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:37,576
your app to display and edit


1103
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:38,246
documents.


1104
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:40,946
It handles sandboxing for you,


1105
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:42,666
so there's no need to make the


1106
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,466
start- and stopAccessing calls.


1107
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:46,696
And, it handles file


1108
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:47,736
coordination for you.


1109
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:49,246
So, there's no need for you to


1110
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,896
manually coordinate access to


1111
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:51,706
these documents.


1112
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:55,646
For more information on file


1113
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:58,186
coordination and UIDocument, we


1114
00:38:58,186 --> 00:38:59,386
invite you to check out the


1115
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:02,176
"Building Document-Based Apps"


1116
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:06,056
session from WWDC 2015, which


1117
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:07,626
covers these topics in great


1118
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:09,526
detail.


1119
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:11,976
Alright. We can now access our


1120
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,466
documents, and we are sure to


1121
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:14,696
read and write to them in a


1122
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:15,586
consistent state.


1123
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:18,026
We can edit our particle system.


1124
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:19,526
And now, what we're going to do


1125
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,106
is just switch apps for just a


1126
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:22,716
second, check out the WWDC


1127
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:24,646
webpage, and just jump back to


1128
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:25,566
our app.


1129
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:28,526
Hmm. As you can see here, we


1130
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:30,236
were in the editor, but now we


1131
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:31,576
went back to the browser.


1132
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:34,016
Your customer always expects to


1133
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:35,576
be brought back to where they


1134
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:37,416
were when they were using your


1135
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:38,726
app.


1136
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,426
Let's try to understand what


1137
00:39:40,426 --> 00:39:41,726
happened in our previous


1138
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:42,166
example.


1139
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:45,186
Here's a diagram of our app's


1140
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:45,796
lifecycle.


1141
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:48,586
We started off in the foreground


1142
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:49,946
while we were editing the app


1143
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:52,436
particle system, and we then


1144
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:54,286
were taken to the background


1145
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,726
when we used the App Switcher to


1146
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:57,726
switch to Safari.


1147
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,816
The system suspended our app


1148
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:01,906
while it was in the background.


1149
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:04,486
It turns out that at the time,


1150
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:06,236
our system was under some memory


1151
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:08,126
pressure, and so the system


1152
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:09,566
terminated our app.


1153
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,866
When we used the App Switcher to


1154
00:40:12,866 --> 00:40:14,866
switch back to our app, our app


1155
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:15,546
was relaunched.


1156
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,046
What we failed to do here was


1157
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:19,176
restore the UI state.


1158
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:21,196
And, that time was a good time


1159
00:40:21,196 --> 00:40:22,956
to restore the UI state, to


1160
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,386
bring back our customer to where


1161
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:24,736
they were.


1162
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:28,116
So, how do we implement state


1163
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:28,736
restoration?


1164
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,266
A simple and easy way would be


1165
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,686
to persist the URL we've


1166
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:34,146
received from the Document


1167
00:40:34,146 --> 00:40:35,726
Browser, or the Document Picker,


1168
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,856
and restore it at app relaunch.


1169
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:40,846
That wouldn't work though, for


1170
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:41,586
two reasons.


1171
00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:44,856
First, the document that the URL


1172
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:46,726
points to could have been moved


1173
00:40:46,726 --> 00:40:47,306
or renamed.


1174
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:48,826
And so, we'd end up with a


1175
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:50,406
broken link at app relaunch.


1176
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:53,286
And second, the security scoped


1177
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,436
resource that is attached to our


1178
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:58,436
URL is not encoded when that URL


1179
00:40:58,436 --> 00:40:59,166
is persistent.


1180
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:01,446
And so, when we relaunch our


1181
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:03,886
app, we again lose access to


1182
00:41:03,886 --> 00:41:05,986
this document, even if that


1183
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,216
document wasn't moved or


1184
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:07,646
renamed.


1185
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:12,026
The correct solution is to use a


1186
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:13,886
security scoped bookmark, that


1187
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:15,176
we get from our URL.


1188
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,376
And, as you can see, the


1189
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:18,886
bookmark correctly references


1190
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:20,906
the document, even if it has


1191
00:41:20,906 --> 00:41:21,966
been moved or renamed.


1192
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:29,206
To save the security scoped


1193
00:41:29,206 --> 00:41:31,326
bookmark, we must first get it


1194
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:33,166
from the URL, using the


1195
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,356
bookmarkData API on the URL.


1196
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:37,226
And, we will then persist it to


1197
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:37,566
disk.


1198
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:40,596
Once our app is relaunched, we


1199
00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:42,386
can restore the original URL


1200
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,516
using the URL resulting


1201
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:47,546
bookmarkData call.


1202
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:49,636
Alright. Now that we have all


1203
00:41:49,636 --> 00:41:51,036
the ingredients to save and


1204
00:41:51,036 --> 00:41:53,076
restore UI state, let's jump to


1205
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:53,776
a quick demo to see it in


1206
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:53,926
action.


1207
00:42:02,046 --> 00:42:04,296
So, here we are in the


1208
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:07,266
simulator, running the Particles


1209
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:08,736
app as seen previously.


1210
00:42:10,286 --> 00:42:11,556
And, what we're going to do is


1211
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:12,506
just take our app to the


1212
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:13,056
background.


1213
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:14,606
And now, we are going to


1214
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:15,966
simulate the fact that the


1215
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,596
system is killing our app, by


1216
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:18,976
killing it in Xcode.


1217
00:42:23,056 --> 00:42:25,596
If we launch our app again, we


1218
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:26,886
see that we jump back to the


1219
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:27,336
browser.


1220
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:29,276
So, now what we're going to do


1221
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:31,646
is implement state preservation


1222
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:33,336
and restoration, to be able to


1223
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:34,456
jump back to where we were.


1224
00:42:35,776 --> 00:42:37,536
So, I'll move to Xcode.


1225
00:42:38,086 --> 00:42:39,716
First of all, in our app


1226
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:41,096
delegate, we'll declare to our


1227
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,546
app that we're interested in


1228
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:44,056
state preservation, and then


1229
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:44,706
restoration.


1230
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:48,936
And, to do that we first return


1231
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:49,946
"true" in application


1232
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:51,746
shouldSaveApplicationState.


1233
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:53,706
And also, return "true" in


1234
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:54,306
application


1235
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:55,896
shouldRestoreApplicationState.


1236
00:42:57,716 --> 00:42:59,536
Second, we'll go to our


1237
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,406
storyboard, and give our


1238
00:43:01,406 --> 00:43:02,886
DocumentBrowserViewController


1239
00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:05,296
subclass a restoration ID, so


1240
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:08,516
that the system restores this


1241
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:08,926
object.


1242
00:43:09,846 --> 00:43:11,366
And in this example, we'll


1243
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:16,306
simply use the storyboard ID.


1244
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:18,326
Next, we're going to implement


1245
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:19,716
state preservation and


1246
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:21,256
restoration in this


1247
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:22,726
documentBrowserViewController


1248
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:23,316
subclass.


1249
00:43:25,996 --> 00:43:28,236
So, first I start by


1250
00:43:28,236 --> 00:43:28,846
implementing


1251
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:30,166
encodeRestorableState.


1252
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:35,036
We get the editorViewController,


1253
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:36,856
if it exists, and get the


1254
00:43:36,856 --> 00:43:39,366
document URL from it.


1255
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:40,716
Once we have that URL-- I'm


1256
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:42,856
going to make this a bit bigger.


1257
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:45,976
Once we have this URL, we start


1258
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:47,276
accessing it to extend our


1259
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:49,176
Sandbox as described previously.


1260
00:43:50,626 --> 00:43:52,596
And, the defer block, we stop


1261
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:58,306
accessing once we are done using


1262
00:43:58,816 --> 00:43:58,886
it.


1263
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:01,606
If we can start accessing this


1264
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:04,826
document, we simply create a


1265
00:44:04,826 --> 00:44:06,666
bookmarkData block from this


1266
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,076
document, and encode it.


1267
00:44:08,576 --> 00:44:11,986
And, finally, we don't forget to


1268
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:12,556
call super.


1269
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,116
Alright. Now that we know how to


1270
00:44:16,116 --> 00:44:17,506
encode our restorable state,


1271
00:44:17,846 --> 00:44:19,926
we'll implement restorable state


1272
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:20,486
decoding.


1273
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:23,366
And, to do this, we start


1274
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:23,916
implementing


1275
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:25,126
decodeRestorableState.


1276
00:44:25,686 --> 00:44:27,266
And, we'll do the inverse steps.


1277
00:44:28,036 --> 00:44:29,506
So, first we get the


1278
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:30,896
bookmarkData from the coder.


1279
00:44:31,526 --> 00:44:34,396
And, if it exists, create that


1280
00:44:34,396 --> 00:44:36,166
document URL using the URL


1281
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:38,346
resolvingBookmarkData call.


1282
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:42,556
And, we simply present the


1283
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:45,506
document at that URL.


1284
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:47,956
And, last but not least, we


1285
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:49,106
don't forget to call super.


1286
00:44:50,496 --> 00:44:51,916
Alright. So, let's run our app.


1287
00:44:57,646 --> 00:44:59,156
And so, our app will now be


1288
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:00,686
launched in the simulator.


1289
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,916
As you can see, we can start


1290
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:05,726
using our document.


1291
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:08,586
And, again, going to take our


1292
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:09,556
app to the background.


1293
00:45:09,886 --> 00:45:11,676
Simulate the system killing our


1294
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:11,886
app.


1295
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:18,186
And, we're going to relaunch our


1296
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:19,926
app, and as you can see here,


1297
00:45:20,246 --> 00:45:20,976
we're back to our editor.


1298
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:28,546
[ Applause ]


1299
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:31,046
Awesome. We can now access


1300
00:45:31,046 --> 00:45:32,936
documents, read and write to


1301
00:45:32,936 --> 00:45:34,306
them without risking data


1302
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:36,336
corruption, and we can now even


1303
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:37,776
restore state and bring our


1304
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,406
customer back to where they were


1305
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:40,886
when they were using our app.


1306
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:42,896
Even if our app was killed in


1307
00:45:43,696 --> 00:45:44,946
the background.


1308
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:47,246
So, if you open the files up,


1309
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:48,936
and we tap on Share in the


1310
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:50,956
callout menu, on documents that


1311
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,976
your app can handle, you notice


1312
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:54,636
that our app is now available in


1313
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:55,136
the Share sheet.


1314
00:45:56,096 --> 00:45:58,726
However, it says "Copy to"


1315
00:45:58,906 --> 00:45:59,926
instead of "Open in."


1316
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:03,106
What this means is as soon as we


1317
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:04,726
tap on our app icon in the Share


1318
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:06,456
sheet, the system will make a


1319
00:46:06,456 --> 00:46:09,096
copy of this document, and serve


1320
00:46:09,096 --> 00:46:10,986
this copy to our app.


1321
00:46:10,986 --> 00:46:12,596
And, practically this means that


1322
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:14,326
the customer would start editing


1323
00:46:14,326 --> 00:46:15,616
a copy of the document.


1324
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:19,056
To allow your customers to open


1325
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:20,816
and edit the original document


1326
00:46:21,756 --> 00:46:23,696
that we wish to access in your


1327
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:26,206
app, you need to adopt an iOS


1328
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:28,106
feature called Open in Place.


1329
00:46:28,636 --> 00:46:32,066
If you do adopt Open in Place,


1330
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,276
you see the "Open in" your app


1331
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:35,856
in the Share sheet, instead of


1332
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:38,576
the previous "Copy to."


1333
00:46:38,826 --> 00:46:40,676
Adopting Open in Place is very


1334
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:41,076
simple.


1335
00:46:41,816 --> 00:46:43,676
If you use the document-based


1336
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,586
app Xcode template, you'll get


1337
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:47,656
this behavior for free, as Open


1338
00:46:47,656 --> 00:46:49,286
in Place is already enabled by


1339
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:49,856
default there.


1340
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,676
Otherwise, you'll need to add


1341
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:52,966
the


1342
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:55,026
LSSupportsOpeningDocumentInPlace


1343
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:57,756
to your info.plist.


1344
00:46:57,756 --> 00:46:58,806
Once you've declared to the


1345
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:00,956
system that your app handles


1346
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:03,056
Open in Place, we must access


1347
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:05,076
the document in the following UI


1348
00:47:05,076 --> 00:47:06,356
application delegate method.


1349
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,876
Again, if your app is document


1350
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:12,996
browser-based, typically in this


1351
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,646
method, you make the


1352
00:47:14,646 --> 00:47:16,646
revealDocument call on the


1353
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:18,166
documentBrowserViewController.


1354
00:47:19,376 --> 00:47:21,016
Once the completion handler is


1355
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:22,596
called in this method, you


1356
00:47:22,596 --> 00:47:23,686
present the document in the


1357
00:47:23,686 --> 00:47:24,476
completion handler.


1358
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:26,926
This is already done for you in


1359
00:47:26,926 --> 00:47:27,676
the Xcode template.


1360
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:31,246
We can now tap on our app icon


1361
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:32,806
in the Share sheet, and go


1362
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:34,506
straight to our app.


1363
00:47:34,506 --> 00:47:36,176
As you see here, we report


1364
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:38,266
progress in the UI, since the


1365
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:41,116
document could be in the cloud.


1366
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:42,866
And, since that download could


1367
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:44,926
take awhile, we also support


1368
00:47:44,926 --> 00:47:46,626
user cancellation, so we can


1369
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:48,096
cancel opening this document,


1370
00:47:48,096 --> 00:47:51,116
and jump back to the browser.


1371
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:52,946
Here's how you can implement


1372
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:56,186
progress supporting in your app.


1373
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,216
If you call the


1374
00:47:57,216 --> 00:47:58,666
documentBrowserViewController


1375
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:00,896
revealDocument API that's been


1376
00:48:00,896 --> 00:48:02,736
described previously, you get


1377
00:48:02,736 --> 00:48:03,886
that UI for free.


1378
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:06,436
So, you'll see a loading UI on


1379
00:48:06,526 --> 00:48:08,426
top of the icon in the browser.


1380
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,646
Otherwise, you may opt to


1381
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:13,366
display your own progress UI.


1382
00:48:14,336 --> 00:48:16,376
If your app uses UIDocument, you


1383
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:17,906
should know that UIDocument


1384
00:48:18,256 --> 00:48:20,116
conforms to progressReporting.


1385
00:48:20,876 --> 00:48:22,506
And so, to display your own


1386
00:48:22,506 --> 00:48:24,796
progress UI, you simply access


1387
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:26,786
the progress property to display


1388
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:30,326
your own progress.


1389
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,306
Alright. Our app is now awesome.


1390
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:34,056
And, we're finally ready to ship


1391
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:36,566
it.


1392
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,946
So, what's the takeaway today to


1393
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:41,126
make your apps excellent at


1394
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,466
managing documents on iOS?


1395
00:48:45,036 --> 00:48:47,636
Adopt UIDocument when displaying


1396
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,396
and editing documents, as it


1397
00:48:49,536 --> 00:48:51,396
eliminates a lot of boilerplate


1398
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:52,436
and error-prone code.


1399
00:48:54,786 --> 00:48:56,276
However, if you already have


1400
00:48:56,346 --> 00:48:57,586
document editing code that


1401
00:48:57,586 --> 00:48:59,866
doesn't use UIDocument, adopt


1402
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:01,436
the start- and stopAccessing


1403
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:03,696
best practices to make sure that


1404
00:49:03,696 --> 00:49:05,036
you interact successfully with


1405
00:49:05,036 --> 00:49:07,726
Sandbox documents, or Sandbox--


1406
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:09,576
with the app Sandbox.


1407
00:49:11,096 --> 00:49:13,456
And also, coordinate accesses to


1408
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:15,346
your documents to make sure that


1409
00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:17,016
you read and write to them in a


1410
00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:19,656
consistent state.


1411
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:21,476
Implement state restoration to


1412
00:49:21,476 --> 00:49:22,986
always bring back your customer


1413
00:49:22,986 --> 00:49:24,396
to where they were, when they


1414
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:26,186
were using your app, even if


1415
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:28,096
your app is killed in the


1416
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:29,086
background.


1417
00:49:29,086 --> 00:49:31,166
Adopt Open in Place, so that


1418
00:49:31,306 --> 00:49:32,876
your customer always edits the


1419
00:49:32,876 --> 00:49:34,926
original document, and doesn't


1420
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:37,366
need to start editing copies of


1421
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:37,986
that document.


1422
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,346
And, also report progress,


1423
00:49:40,466 --> 00:49:42,226
especially in a world where most


1424
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,356
of these documents could be in


1425
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:44,726
the cloud, and not available


1426
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:45,116
locally.


1427
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:49,136
So, what did we cover today?


1428
00:49:49,936 --> 00:49:51,996
We have shown you how easy it is


1429
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:53,866
to adopt the Document Browser


1430
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,116
and Document Picker API's.


1431
00:49:55,686 --> 00:49:58,006
Give them a try in your app


1432
00:49:58,696 --> 00:49:58,836
today.


1433
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:02,026
We learned about best practices


1434
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,486
so that our apps become


1435
00:50:03,486 --> 00:50:05,266
excellent at managing documents,


1436
00:50:06,326 --> 00:50:09,296
and for you cloud vendors, we


1437
00:50:09,296 --> 00:50:10,406
talked about the new Siri


1438
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:12,456
shortcuts, and how they allow


1439
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:15,276
your app-- sorry, your documents


1440
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:17,866
that are frequently accessed to


1441
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:18,946
be available throughout the


1442
00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:20,296
system for your customers.


1443
00:50:20,816 --> 00:50:23,486
And, we talked about the


1444
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:25,206
fileProvider validation tool,


1445
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:28,296
and gave guidelines on how to


1446
00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:29,616
implement an effective


1447
00:50:29,616 --> 00:50:31,016
authentication flow in your


1448
00:50:31,016 --> 00:50:32,736
fileProviderUI extensions.


1449
