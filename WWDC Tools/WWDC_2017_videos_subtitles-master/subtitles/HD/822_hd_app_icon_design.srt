[ Silence ]

2
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:47,156
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:48,986
>> You all know that every app,

4
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:50,776
even your app, needs an app

5
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:51,206
icon.

6
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:53,086
It's the symbol that represents

7
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,876
your product on the Home screen

8
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:55,816
and the App Store.

9
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:58,566
Humanity has been using symbols

10
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,016
to communicate ideas since

11
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,346
antiquity; even Apple was doing

12
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,036
this a long, long time ago.

13
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:06,516
I'm only joking.

14
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:07,346
I'm only joking, of course.

15
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:08,206
I hope there are no

16
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:08,996
egyptologists [phonetic] in the

17
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:09,766
room that were offended.

18
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:11,756
But in all seriousness, we have

19
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:13,486
a long rich history of using

20
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:15,646
symbols, literal, non-literal,

21
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:17,016
as a method of communication,

22
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,326
and we extend this to the modern

23
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:20,606
world, but we apply the same

24
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:21,866
principles to the user interface

25
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:22,086
design.

26
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:24,306
For example, there was your

27
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:24,946
Macintosh.

28
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,376
We're going to take a quick trip

29
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:28,146
down memory lane and take a

30
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:29,736
closer look at some classic Mac

31
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:30,836
OS icons.

32
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,816
Many metaphors have stuck around

33
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,396
for three decades of Mac OS.

34
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,596
Investing in simple application

35
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,086
iconography was a way to

36
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,736
emotionally relate to the user.

37
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:41,166
It made the system approachable

38
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:42,646
and easy to use.

39
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:45,246
It also made the platform unique

40
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:46,116
and stand apart from the

41
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:46,736
competition.

42
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:50,016
Many are close approximations of

43
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,076
real world objects, and some

44
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,446
concepts might be a little on

45
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,166
the abstract side, but they all

46
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,386
live within a system that tells

47
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,176
a user that they're

48
00:01:57,176 --> 00:01:57,906
interconnected.

49
00:01:58,276 --> 00:01:59,686
For example, they're

50
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,826
appropriate; some are families,

51
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:02,786
like families of maps or

52
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:05,236
families of documents, and due

53
00:02:05,236 --> 00:02:06,796
to time, we've moved beyond some

54
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:07,796
metaphors, either because the

55
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:08,946
technology was surpassed, like

56
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,206
the floppy disc; remember those,

57
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:13,446
or the metaphor we're seeing is

58
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:14,676
too aggressive, like the bomb.

59
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,526
Or we had to learn a concept

60
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:19,196
like the hieroglyph .

61
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:21,436
Over time the face was removed,

62
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:22,586
and we've come to notice there's

63
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:23,856
just the explanation point.

64
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:26,586
Even smaller glyphs share the

65
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:27,326
same principle.

66
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:28,266
So, let's take a close look at

67
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,366
one of my personal favorites,

68
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:29,926
the paint bucket.

69
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,416
The paint bucket fills your

70
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,015
canvas with color, just like

71
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,246
spilling a real can of paint on

72
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:35,626
the floor.

73
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,596
At the time, this was an

74
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:38,886
abstract idea, but it was

75
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:40,236
grounded here by a real world

76
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:40,636
object.

77
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:43,066
And how about how this was drawn

78
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,826
even in those days?

79
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:46,366
Consider the consistency of line

80
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:46,556
weight.

81
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:48,626
There's implied movement in the

82
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,346
angle, a subtle indication of

83
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,046
perspective.

84
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:54,346
It's got a good balance of black

85
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:54,666
and white.

86
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,276
It's simple and high contrast.

87
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,816
These examples represent some

88
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,256
fundamental principles that we

89
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,686
still use today when designing

90
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:02,316
app icons.

91
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,266
The first, metaphor, finding an

92
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,866
easily identifiable metaphor

93
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:09,976
that will object or graphic logo

94
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:10,836
a mark.

95
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:12,736
The second, simplicity; your

96
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:13,716
design should be simple and

97
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:15,076
clear, no clutter or over

98
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:15,706
complicate it.

99
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,356
If your icon is designed well,

100
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:18,766
it should be quick and easy to

101
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:20,066
read.

102
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:20,696
Connection.

103
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:22,866
Aiming to create an emotional

104
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,536
connection with the user, the

105
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,996
icon is the face of your app as

106
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:26,686
much as the UI.

107
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,396
Keep it fun, keep it engaging.

108
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:31,576
And lineage, make changes to

109
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:33,106
your icon meaningful and

110
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:33,536
deliberate.

111
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:35,466
Don't change your app icon every

112
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,786
single time that you update your

113
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:37,006
app.

114
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,786
Refine your identity over time.

115
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:40,986
So, let's think about some of

116
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,356
these principles as they related

117
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,006
to an Apple app.

118
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:46,416
Keynote. Since version 1, all

119
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,326
the way back in 2003, the app's

120
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:49,996
identity has been the podium.

121
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,266
And why the podium, you ask?

122
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:54,356
Well, the symbology is

123
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,726
important, especially today of

124
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:56,066
all days.

125
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,256
It is a real old metaphor that

126
00:03:58,256 --> 00:03:59,276
many can relate to.

127
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,356
Presenters have used podiums for

128
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,076
generations, and to add an

129
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,106
emotional connection, the

130
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:05,896
presenter notes rest on a warm

131
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:06,736
wooden surface.

132
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,326
The microphone adds a familiar

133
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:08,716
detail.

134
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,236
It immediately sets the stage

135
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:12,666
for what keynote does, and we

136
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,716
didn't want to lose that.

137
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:15,296
As keynote has moved from

138
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,896
version to version, we updated

139
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:17,626
the materials, and we've

140
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:19,146
transitioned from a classic to a

141
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:21,406
modern style, but the notion of

142
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:22,306
the podium has remained

143
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:22,946
consistent.

144
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,566
The lineage provides users with

145
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,566
a sense of familiarity.

146
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,566
The podium was such a strong

147
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:28,656
mark that when we designed our

148
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,316
apps for iOS, we simplified the

149
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:32,056
podium to more of a glyph and

150
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:32,616
brought it over.

151
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:34,566
The visual connection here is

152
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,566
really important because it

153
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,846
tells users that they can expect

154
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:38,096
at consistent experience across

155
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:38,556
platforms.

156
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,066
And if you have a family of

157
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,596
apps, take a look at the iLook

158
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:43,136
icons.

159
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:45,986
Keynote uses the podium on both

160
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:46,906
Mac and iOS.

161
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:49,936
Pages uses the pen, a metaphor

162
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,176
for writing and the written

163
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:51,366
word.

164
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,576
The paper is denoted by a line

165
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,816
on iOS but helps to ground the

166
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,806
pen to a surface.

167
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:58,296
Numbers uses a flat and more 2D

168
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:00,546
representation of the chart and

169
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:01,986
the table on iOS.

170
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:04,226
We extend the same principles to

171
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,596
GarageBand with, and iMovie with

172
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,376
the guitar and the staff.

173
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,896
The metaphor in color palettes

174
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:11,006
for all of these actually share

175
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,846
the cross platform to reinforce

176
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,616
the idea of family.

177
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,056
Let's focus in on a few details.

178
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,806
Some things are super important.

179
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:20,006
First off, the colors harmonize

180
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,206
with the rest of iOSs vibrant

181
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:22,806
color palette.

182
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:24,026
The glyphs are simple.

183
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:25,996
They all share the same mass.

184
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,646
They're white and high contrast.

185
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:29,026
There are no unnecessary

186
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:30,856
details, and they all share the

187
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:31,596
same ground plane.

188
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:34,026
This might just look like the

189
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,516
Keynote podium, but there are

190
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:36,626
some subtle optimizations

191
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:37,236
within.

192
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,396
For example, the corners are all

193
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:40,876
custom curves, so they appear

194
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:42,336
really smooth, a large and small

195
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:42,806
size.

196
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:45,236
So, again, the same principles,

197
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:46,446
metaphor, simplicity,

198
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:47,916
connection, lineage.

199
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:49,606
Let's look at these as they

200
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:50,856
relate to another app, music

201
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:52,136
memo, shown here on the right.

202
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:53,596
There's a clear connection to

203
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:54,946
the history of GarageBand

204
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:56,226
through color and metaphor.

205
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:57,686
The circle is reminiscent of a

206
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:59,036
sound hole in an acoustic

207
00:05:59,036 --> 00:05:59,396
guitar.

208
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:01,726
The strings vibrate in a playful

209
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:02,276
graphic way.

210
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:03,616
There's a sense of movement and

211
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:04,346
creativity.

212
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:06,966
The icon makes use of the iOS

213
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,526
icon grid so that when music

214
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:09,736
memos appears next to other

215
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,666
icons in the system, the common

216
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,066
elements like the circle are the

217
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,376
same size as say Safari.

218
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,746
Now, we're going to do something

219
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:17,776
a little fun.

220
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:18,726
We're going to take a look at

221
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,916
the News app icon to look at

222
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,226
some of the more practical

223
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,556
considerations to think of when

224
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,966
you design your app icon and

225
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,236
some tests that you can do at

226
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:26,366
home to make sure that your

227
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,526
design is holding up at a

228
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,226
smaller size.

229
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:31,646
So, let's ask ourselves a

230
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,986
question, in a hypothetical

231
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,676
world, what if News were the

232
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,206
only app on the home screen?

233
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,666
What would the icon have to

234
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,666
communicate for it to be

235
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,956
immediately clear that News does

236
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:44,076
what News actually does?

237
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,256
Or to be understood without a

238
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,436
name underneath the icon?

239
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:49,346
How would a good use of

240
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:51,306
simplicity, form, color,

241
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,646
contrast, composition help it to

242
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,196
be understood?

243
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:55,456
You think an icon would have to

244
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,356
work twice as hard, right?

245
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:58,606
Well, here's a few other props

246
00:06:58,606 --> 00:06:59,566
that we tried along the way.

247
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,136
The first icon here has a peak

248
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:03,766
of paper is a little abstract.

249
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:05,116
Does the end rest on a

250
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:06,396
newspaper, or a white box?

251
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:07,846
A little hard to tell, and much

252
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:09,116
of the red background is hidden.

253
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,356
The second introduces another

254
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:12,326
sheet behind the first, which

255
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:13,836
helps to reinforce the metaphor

256
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:15,406
a little, but when the other

257
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:16,406
edges are missing, you can't

258
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:17,376
tell that the N is actually

259
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:18,776
resting on a newspaper, and the

260
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,116
color is still fairly hidden.

261
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:22,246
Let's look at the third design.

262
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:23,926
You can clearly see all the

263
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:24,726
edges on the newspaper.

264
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,596
The white is high contrast; the

265
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:27,756
red background pops.

266
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,216
The rendering of the newspaper

267
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,626
and logo text is simple, bold,

268
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:32,096
and graphic.

269
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:33,456
Why does this matter?

270
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:35,966
Well, when you look at your icon

271
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:36,876
on the Home screen, you can

272
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:37,836
really see what holds up at a

273
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,396
small size and is the right mix

274
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:41,276
for contrast form and color.

275
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:42,276
Here's the three designs at a

276
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:42,826
small size.

277
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,816
And try testing your icon in a

278
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:47,516
folder next to other icons.

279
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:48,406
Squint your eyes.

280
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:49,926
Where's the news article?

281
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,096
Right there on the top left.

282
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,176
And it's easy to see because of

283
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:54,996
the simple design.

284
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,176
The composition is distinct.

285
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,446
It's high contrast, and the

286
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,706
color is clearly visible.

287
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,166
Designing an app icon is an

288
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,176
iterative process.

289
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:04,316
So, here's some other things

290
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,046
that you could think about as

291
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:06,066
you start to design yours.

292
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,076
We'll start with the first,

293
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:09,316
trying to be unique.

294
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:11,426
Now, that might sound like a

295
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:13,086
tall order, but it's important

296
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:14,156
to be really aware of other apps

297
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:14,736
in your category.

298
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,306
Here's the three apps in the

299
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:18,706
video space, Quick, Instagram,

300
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:19,236
Periscope.

301
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,426
Let's look at how different

302
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:22,176
these icons are.

303
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:23,776
Colors and shapes are bold.

304
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,676
Each is distinct; it stands out

305
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:26,236
on the Home screen.

306
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:28,586
Instagram is also a great

307
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:29,746
example of how an icon can

308
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:31,296
become synonymous with a company

309
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:32,276
the moment you see the white

310
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:33,596
camera glyph, the purple sky,

311
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,976
you immediately think Instagram.

312
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,246
Second, experiment.

313
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:41,476
Now, despite how beautiful a

314
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:42,836
blank canvas is, starting here

315
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,156
might be a little daunting.

316
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,566
So, why not try a little bit of

317
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:46,786
sketching.

318
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:48,616
Even if you don't think you can

319
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,346
raw, sometimes a pen and paper

320
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:51,756
goes way further than a mouse,

321
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,356
and sketching is a great way to

322
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,386
get your ideas out without

323
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:55,496
worrying about finessing your

324
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:56,216
icon early on.

325
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,326
Do some doodles; show your

326
00:08:58,356 --> 00:08:59,586
friends; get their ideas.

327
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:01,446
This is your app icon, so your

328
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:02,285
design has to pop.

329
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:03,256
Have some fun with it.

330
00:09:04,515 --> 00:09:06,456
Further, and perhaps most

331
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,346
important, test.

332
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,296
What do we mean by test?

333
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:12,456
Well, as you develop your app

334
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:13,526
icon, examine on the Home

335
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,446
screen, in a folder, and if your

336
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:16,546
app has settings, the settings

337
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:16,646
app.

338
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,516
And be careful if you decide to

339
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:20,796
represent your user interface in

340
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:21,276
your icon.

341
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,316
Clear is a great example of

342
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:25,136
doing this really, really well.

343
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:26,976
They've got a strong visual

344
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,806
style with recognizable colors

345
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:30,516
and a simple brand of pattern

346
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,186
that really helps to stand out

347
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:32,996
at a small size.

348
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,306
Again, it's simple, colorful,

349
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:35,346
high contrast.

350
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:38,636
And last but not least, have

351
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,236
some patience.

352
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:40,936
The answer might not come to you

353
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:41,366
right away.

354
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,286
Take your time, examine your

355
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,186
options, and save your work.

356
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,096
Oftentimes, it's the simplest

357
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:48,916
design or an early direction

358
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,806
that you abandoned that you

359
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:50,926
actually ultimately find is the

360
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:51,476
right choice.

361
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:55,206
So, to summarize, when designing

362
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,516
your app icon, think about

363
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,046
metaphor, a clearly identifiable

364
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:03,006
object or symbol that is simple

365
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,026
and easy to understand.

366
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,176
To create an emotional

367
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,516
connection with the user, be

368
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:08,416
fun, be playful.

369
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,286
And lineage, your icon is the

370
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:12,226
face of your app.

371
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:13,496
It's our brand.

372
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,556
Think of your icon as an

373
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:15,106
investment.

374
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:18,306
And for the process, try to make

375
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,846
your icon unique so it stands

376
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:21,256
out on the Home screen and the

377
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:21,666
App Store.

378
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,476
Experiment with different

379
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:25,416
designs and test them.

380
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:26,876
Use the icon grid.

381
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,886
Look at icons that Apple has

382
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,366
designed as reference for form

383
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:30,756
and color.

384
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,576
See what looks good, big and

385
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:32,876
small.

386
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,886
Put your icon in a folder to see

387
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:35,836
how it looks at a really small

388
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:36,316
size.

389
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:38,436
And don't forget to optimize

390
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:39,416
your assets for different device

391
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:39,836
sizes.

392
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,426
And above all, have patience.

393
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,246
Designing an app icon can seem

394
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,616
like a lot of work, but if you

395
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:46,646
invest the time to do it, it can

396
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,396
really, really pay off.

397
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:47,976
Thanks for your time.
