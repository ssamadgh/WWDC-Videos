1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,403
Apple Watch Series 4


2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,439
includes significant
enhancements


3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,875
for designers and developers.


4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:11,545
Series 4 watches have new
displays with larger dimensions,


5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,982
along with new APIs
and improvements in performance,


6
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:18,218
enhancing your ability
to deliver rich information


7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,788
and actions to the people
who use your app.


8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,424
You'll want to take these
new dimensions into account


9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,027
as your create
or update your app.


10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,163
Series 4 watches are larger
than watches in previous series.


11
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,800
They come in two sizes, measured
on the exterior of the case:


12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,005
40mm and 44mm.


13
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:42,609
Previous series of Apple Watch
are 38mm and 42mm.


14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,145
And the display dimensions
of these watches


15
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:50,984
measure 272 by 340 pixels
on 38mm watches,


16
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:56,056
and 312 by 390 pixels
on 42mm watches.


17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,526
The displays of Series 4 watches
have grown significantly,


18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:04,730
measuring 324 by 394 pixels
for 40mm,


19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,203
and 368 by 448 pixels for 44mm.


20
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,039
Not only is display larger,


21
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,107
but the border around it
is thinner,


22
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,877
bringing more attention
to interactive elements,


23
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:21,248
and making the information
feel richer and more immersive.


24
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,217
You'll want to account
for all display dimensions.


25
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,753
Your app should deliver
the same information


26
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,390
and actions to the user,
regardless of screen size.


27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,892
As you consider your layouts,


28
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,696
notice that the display
of the 40mm Series 4 watch


29
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,898
is actually very similar
in dimension


30
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:43,103
to the display of the 42mm
watches of previous series.


31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,872
The new 40mm watch
has a display size


32
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:50,444
that is 12 pixels wider
and 4 pixels taller.


33
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,145
Looking across the case sizes,


34
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:56,249
40 and 42mm watches
sit in the middle of a spectrum.


35
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,286
If you target your screens
layouts here,


36
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,022
you should then ensure
your layouts scale down


37
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:07,761
to 38mm dimensions,
and up for 44mm dimensions.


38
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,830
The Design Resources
on developer.apple.com


39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,567
contain assets and templates
to get you started


40
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,902
in designing for all 4 sizes.


41
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,605
Be aware that some watchOS
interface elements


42
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,707
scale with the watch size.


43
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,510
The templates contain
extensive collections


44
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,246
of these elements,
organized by watch size,


45
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:32,019
to ensure that your mock-ups are
as pixel-precise as possible.


46
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,354
So now let's talk about
how these new displays


47
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,190
impact the layout
of your screens.


48
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,428
The most notable difference
of the new display is its shape.


49
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,796
Like iPhone X,


50
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,165
Apple Watch Series 4
has rounded corners,


51
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,566
creating a symmetrical look


52
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,536
within the curved corners
of the case.


53
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,038
WatchKit will assist you


54
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,473
in the presentation
of text and controls,


55
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,643
so that your UI appears
in an optimal location


56
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,078
in the viewport.


57
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,781
WatchKit elements will adapt
to the new displays.


58
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,917
At the top,
your app's status bar


59
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,253
will account for
the rounded corners.


60
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,622
As in previous versions
of watchOS,


61
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,358
the clock will appear
on every screen,


62
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,727
and your app can use
the title area


63
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,096
to provide a helpful heading
or title


64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,398
describing the purpose
of the screen.


65
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,134
Both of these elements
will be indented,


66
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,571
and this indentation should
create left and right margins


67
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,107
that extend vertically through
the display of content


68
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,108
in your app.


69
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:31,111
These are
System Minimum Layout Margins.


70
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,480
Graphic elements
and button backgrounds


71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,515
should extend
beyond these margins


72
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,152
and run nearly edge to edge,
up to the one pixel margin


73
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,888
that runs by default
on either side.


74
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,257
Text should align
to the left margin,


75
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:48,328
extending from the left edge
of the text in the status bar.


76
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,664
To account for the corners
in scroll views,


77
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,467
there are clear areas
at the top and bottom


78
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,135
of the content area.


79
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,537
These are known as
scroll clear areas,


80
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,473
and they ensure that text
and buttons


81
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,875
are nudged fully into view


82
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,678
when the user completes
a scrolling action.


83
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:08,081
For example, a button at
the bottom of a scroll view


84
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,918
will settle in the safe area
above the clear area.


85
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,222
If you're using a full-screen
SpriteKit or SceneKit scene,


86
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,190
you'll want to use
the margins and insets


87
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,228
to nudge your content
into view.


88
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,397
The best watch experiences
are simple and glanceable,


89
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,399
so you may have views
within your app


90
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,535
that are intentionally
single-screen


91
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,103
and should not scroll.


92
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,405
For example,
if you want to make sure


93
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,875
that a button rests
in the clear area,


94
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,410
rather than getting nudged up
by the system,


95
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,681
you can do so by setting
an attribute in Xcode.


96
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,984
In the attribute inspector
for the view,


97
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,987
you can select
Fixed to screen edges,


98
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,890
and this will ensure that
the content within that view


99
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,925
will not scroll.


100
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,060
Now let's talk about
updating your app


101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,730
for Apple Watch Series 4.


102
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,232
Your app will run
on Series 4 watches


103
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,869
even before you recompile it
for watchOS 5.


104
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:08,108
It will be displayed at 38mm
dimensions on 40mm watches,


105
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:13,213
and at 42mm dimensions
on 44mm watches.


106
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,516
It will be centered
in Series 4 displays.


107
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,018
And from a user point of view,


108
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,354
your app will appear
and behave predictably.


109
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,690
Recompiling your app
for watchOS 5


110
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,427
will allow your app to occupy
the full width and height


111
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,429
of the new display.


112
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,998
As long as you've implemented
your WatchKit elements


113
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,902
relative to their containers
rather than at fixed widths,


114
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,005
your app will expand to fill
the additional screen space


115
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,042
on Series 4 watches,
and this will feel much more


116
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,878
immersive and engaging
to your users.


117
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,347
If your app contains
a full-screen SpriteKit


118
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,916
or SceneKit scene,
you'll want to make sure


119
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,018
that text and controls
in your scene


120
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,955
are rendered correctly
on Series 4 watches.


121
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,824
You should access the
System Minimum Layout Margins


122
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,760
to ensure that your content
is inset properly


123
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,029
from the left and right edges
of the screen,


124
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,799
and the Content Safe Area Inset
information


125
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,702
to ensure that text and actions
settle appropriately


126
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:13,940
in the content area of the watch
when the user scrolls.


127
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,576
Series 4 introduces new haptics


128
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,446
that correspond with the
rotation of the Digital Crown,


129
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:23,350
creating a more tactile
experience across Apple Watch.


130
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,152
By default,
haptic detents, or taps,


131
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,955
are produced when the
Digital Crown is rotated.


132
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,859
So common user interactions,
like scrolling


133
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,061
or selecting an item
in a picker,


134
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,731
will deliver tactile
feedback to the user.


135
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,666
You should evaluate your
app's experience


136
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,570
with this new haptic feedback
on Series 4 watches.


137
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,707
Users will become accustomed to
a consistent tactile experience,


138
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,076
so if your app coordinates
events in the UI


139
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,878
with Digital Crown rotation,


140
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,314
you'll want to make sure
that those UI events


141
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,950
line up with these
new haptic effects.


142
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,988
Next, let's discuss the new text
styles introduced in watchOS 5,


143
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,357
and the implementation
of Dynamic Type


144
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,493
on Series 4 watches.


145
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,229
In watchOS 5,
the Dynamic Type Library


146
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,033
was expanded to include
four new larger sizes.


147
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,236
Large Title,
and Titles 1, 2, and 3


148
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,539
provide more ways to ensure
that content and actions


149
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,242
are glanceable
on the watch screen.


150
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,611
As you're implementing
and testing these styles,


151
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,446
remember that there
are different


152
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,282
default content categories
that correspond


153
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,384
to the watch case size.


154
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,288
Small is the default
category for 38mm,


155
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:42,195
Large for 40mm and 42mm,
and XLarge for 44mm.


156
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,031
While watches may start
with different default settings,


157
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,367
each offers the same spectrum


158
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:51,037
to accommodate a wide range
of user settings.


159
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,907
Adhering to these styles
will ensure that your app


160
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,943
is delivered predictably
to all users.


161
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,978
Finally, let's discuss
enhancements


162
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,515
related to the visual assets
in your watch project.


163
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,918
You can now streamline
the production of graphics


164
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,455
by using PDFs, allowing for
high-resolution scaling


165
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,190
across device sizes.


166
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,226
If you prepare your graphics
with a scale factor of 2


167
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,128
and save them as PDFs,


168
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,996
you can create a single file


169
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,900
for usage across all
four watch sizes.


170
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,169
When you bring this PDF asset
into Xcode,


171
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,906
place it in the Asset Catalog
of your Watch project,


172
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,110
drop the asset in
the Universal 2x box.


173
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,345
And then, in the
attribute inspector,


174
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,715
adjust the Auto Scaling
property to Automatic.


175
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:40,854
This scales your graphics down
by 9 percent for 38mm displays,


176
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:45,492
and up 10 percent
for 44mm displays.


177
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:49,796
One last note: To account
for the UI of the 44mm watch,


178
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,500
there are two new
app icon sizes.


179
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,403
These new icons will be used
for the short look notification


180
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,038
and the Home screen icon.


181
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,940
Guides and dimensions
for these icons


182
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,810
can be found in the templates
in the Design Resources,


183
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,647
which have been newly updated
for Apple Watch Series 4.


184
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,315
There's also a thorough
introduction


185
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,018
