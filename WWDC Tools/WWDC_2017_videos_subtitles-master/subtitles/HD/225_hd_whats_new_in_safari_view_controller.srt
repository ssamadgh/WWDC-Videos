00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,706
>> Good morning.


2
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:31,386
I'm Chelsea Pugh and I'm an


3
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:33,006
engineer on the Safari team.


4
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:36,016
Welcome to session 225, What's


5
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:37,666
New in Safari View Controller.


6
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,166
Safari View Controller has a


7
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,326
bunch of improvements on iOS 11.


8
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:45,676
It also has new APIs that were


9
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,576
inspired by feedback that we got


10
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:48,296
from developers.


11
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:51,176
I'm really excited to share some


12
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,616
of Safari View Controller's new


13
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:56,696
abilities with you today.


14
00:00:57,606 --> 00:00:59,656
One main use case of displaying


15
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:02,066
web content on iOS is to allow


16
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,436
users to browse the web in your


17
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:05,906
app.


18
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:07,716
You might be displaying a list


19
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:08,976
of links that could lead the


20
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:11,826
user to news articles or maybe


21
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:13,906
your displaying a list of links


22
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,536
that could lead to information


23
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:17,276
of different topics on the web.


24
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:20,546
It could, these links could your


25
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,266
user anywhere on the web, and


26
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:23,926
you don't expect to know where


27
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,216
they'll end up ahead of time.


28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,366
How many of you are doing


29
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:30,366
something like this in your app?


30
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:31,486
All right, there's a few of you


31
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:32,026
out there.


32
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:33,276
You're in the right place.


33
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,166
Another main reason that you'd


34
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,716
want to display web content on


35
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:41,206
iOS is to allow your users to


36
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,476
get authenticated with a


37
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:44,256
third-party service so that it's


38
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:45,866
data can be used in your app.


39
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:47,636
How many of you do something


40
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:48,456
like that in your app?


41
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,196
You're also in the right place.


42
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:54,916
And for those of you that are


43
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,446
providing those experiences to


44
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,926
your user, how many of you are


45
00:01:57,926 --> 00:01:59,436
already using Safari View


46
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:00,026
Controller?


47
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:03,366
Great. If you're already using


48
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,126
Safari View Controller, we have


49
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,436
some improvements to share with


50
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,596
you today that will make Safari


51
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,996
View Controller an even better


52
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,486
experience for your users.


53
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,806
If you aren't using Safari View


54
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:15,156
Controller but you're providing


55
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:17,106
one of those experiences, listen


56
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:17,903
up.


57
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:19,136
The new APIs that we're going to


58
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,086
talk about today were inspired


59
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,016
by feedback from you, and we


60
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,226
think you'll really like to hear


61
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:24,656
about it.


62
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,206
Today I'm going to cover


63
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:31,146
displaying web content on iOS.


64
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:33,806
Then I'll talk about how to


65
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:35,176
really match your app's style


66
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:36,726
using Safari View Controller.


67
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,666
I'll then talk about some


68
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,946
improvements to Safari View


69
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,526
Controller on iOS 11.


70
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,386
Then I'll discuss the new APIs


71
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,446
that have been added to Safari


72
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:49,376
View Controller to really tailor


73
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,066
it to fit your app's use case.


74
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:55,156
First, displaying web content.


75
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:56,956
There are a couple of different


76
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:58,366
ways, but today I'm going to


77
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,236
talk about two of those, using


78
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:02,036
SFSafariViewController and using


79
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:02,966
WKWebView.


80
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,736
To start off, let's talk about


81
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,176
SFSafariViewController.


82
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,096
If you don't know where your


83
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,446
user will be going on the web,


84
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,196
Safari View Controller is really


85
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,516
a good thing for you to use.


86
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:17,706
It gives you standard browsing


87
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,196
features so you don't need to


88
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:20,586
worry about implementing an


89
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:21,666
in-app web browser.


90
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,086
With just a couple lines of


91
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,876
code, you get an in-app web


92
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,306
browser with all of the features


93
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:28,646
that your users know and love


94
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,636
from Safari in your app.


95
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,816
Safari View Controller is also


96
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:34,926
great for getting users


97
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,516
authenticated to a third-party


98
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:36,856
service.


99
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,676
It has the security that users


100
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,636
need while logging in and it has


101
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,126
features that can help them get


102
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:44,046
logged in quickly.


103
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,326
One main example is Password


104
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,016
AutoFill.


105
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,496
They can quickly fill their


106
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,446
saved passwords from Safari and


107
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:51,986
log in with a tap of a button.


108
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:57,136
Now let's talk about WKWebView.


109
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,566
If you don't know the web, or if


110
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,836
you know the content that you'll


111
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:02,666
be displaying to users ahead of


112
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,296
time, or you even have control


113
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,556
over the web content, WKWebView


114
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:07,626
might be right for you.


115
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,806
It allows you to manipulate the


116
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:11,566
DOM using Javascript.


117
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,676
You can also customize


118
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:15,766
navigations by blocking or


119
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:16,706
modifying them.


120
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:19,846
It's a view of web content, so


121
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,396
you can add your own native UI


122
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:22,796
around the web content.


123
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,126
This is great if part of your


124
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:26,646
app's UI is implemented using


125
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:27,676
web technologies.


126
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,176
The web content can blend


127
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:31,636
seamlessly in with your app's


128
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,626
native UI, so users don't even


129
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:35,076
need to know that they're


130
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,386
interacting with web content.


131
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,716
But let's get back to Safari


132
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:40,836
View Controller since I think


133
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:41,746
that's why you're all here.


134
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:45,266
Safari View Controller makes


135
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,616
in-app web browsing easy.


136
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,156
As I mentioned before, with just


137
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:49,796
a couple lines of code, you've


138
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:51,566
got a fully featured web browser


139
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:54,866
within your app.


140
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,496
It provides a secure and safe


141
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,236
browsing experience for users.


142
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,636
Let me tell you about a few of


143
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:02,286
the security features you get


144
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:03,516
with Safari View Controller.


145
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:06,726
First, process separation.


146
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:08,786
There's your app's content and


147
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,776
then there's web content.


148
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:12,296
Safari View Controller is in a


149
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:14,376
separate process from your app.


150
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,876
This means that anything that


151
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,966
the user does on the web won't


152
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,256
have an effect on your app's


153
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:20,706
content.


154
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,636
If they browse to malicious web


155
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:25,566
page it won't be able to affect


156
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,386
your app's data.


157
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,416
You get out of the business of


158
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,226
taking care of user security on


159
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,896
the web because Safari View


160
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,296
Controller will take care of


161
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,016
that for you.


162
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,526
It provides critical security


163
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:37,056
features.


164
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,216
Let's talk about a couple of


165
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:39,386
those.


166
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,256
The lock icon here indicates to


167
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,346
the user that they're browsing


168
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,686
over a secure connection.


169
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,336
This is a really important


170
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:48,606
feature in a browser.


171
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:50,096
And you don't need to worry


172
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,446
about implementing it if you use


173
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:52,826
Safari View Controller for your


174
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:53,866
in-app web browser.


175
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:57,136
Safari View Controller will also


176
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,576
warn users if they might be


177
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,156
trying to navigate to a page


178
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,376
that's going to try to steal


179
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:02,316
their information.


180
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,546
This page is trying to imitate


181
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:06,346
example.com to get my


182
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,036
information.


183
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:09,646
And you get features from


184
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:10,236
Safari.


185
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:11,996
Let me just highlight a few of


186
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,136
the features that you'll get


187
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,526
with Safari View Controller.


188
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,766
You get AutoFill of passwords,


189
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:19,456
contact info, and credit cards.


190
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,946
Users can quickly fill out forms


191
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:22,536
on the web.


192
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,506
Reader is an awesome feature for


193
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,806
decluttering articles on the


194
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:28,136
web.


195
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,166
Our users of this feature love


196
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,536
it, and they'll love getting to


197
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:32,616
use it in your app.


198
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,246
ApplePay on the web can help


199
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:37,866
users quickly make payments


200
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:39,876
while shopping on the web within


201
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:43,156
your app.


202
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:44,446
And users get access to the


203
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,106
Share Sheet that they get


204
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,156
elsewhere on the system.


205
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,406
They get access to some standard


206
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:50,536
system activities that they


207
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,106
might want to perform, as well


208
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:53,836
as any third-party extensions


209
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:55,286
that they have access to in


210
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:55,816
Safari.


211
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,196
And they get content blocker


212
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:00,896
extensions that they'd have in


213
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:01,466
Safari.


214
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:02,846
This means they won't be


215
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,306
confused about why their


216
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,766
ad-blocker isn't working when


217
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,326
browsing the web in your app.


218
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:10,546
And there are so many other


219
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,356
features that you get by


220
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,476
implementing Safari View


221
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,306
Controller as your in-app web


222
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:15,816
browser.


223
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:19,566
Now, I'd like to talk to you


224
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,146
about how you can better match


225
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,026
your app's style with Safari


226
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,676
View Controller on iOS 11.


227
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,486
There are a couple of new ways.


228
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,366
First, it has a new look.


229
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:31,556
If you've seen Safari View


230
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:33,786
Controller prior to iOS 11 you


231
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,656
might have noticed that it


232
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:36,046
looked a lot like Safari.


233
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,796
Let's take a look on iOS 11.


234
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,526
It looks more like an in-app web


235
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,176
browser so users don't feel like


236
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,576
they've jumped out of your app.


237
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,726
This is the design on iPhone.


238
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:49,356
It looks great on iPad too.


239
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,406
Now I want to talk to you about


240
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,246
customizing the color of Safari


241
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:56,976
View Controller so that it fits


242
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:58,456
with your app's color scheme.


243
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,846
The ability to customize Safari


244
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:01,906
View Controller's color was


245
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:04,356
available prior to iOS 11, but


246
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:05,836
we've made an improvement that I


247
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,086
really want you to know about.


248
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,626
First, let's recap the


249
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:10,666
customizations.


250
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:12,916
This is a default Safari View


251
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:13,496
Controller.


252
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,126
It has the same color scheme as


253
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,606
Safari, blue and white.


254
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,386
But let's say my app has a


255
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:19,796
different color scheme, black


256
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:20,286
and aqua.


257
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,796
Here I started using my app's


258
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:25,176
color scheme in Safari View


259
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:25,756
Controller.


260
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,396
So, when I present Safari View


261
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:28,946
Controller to my users it


262
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:30,116
doesn't feel like they've left


263
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:31,366
my app.


264
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,476
And it's a really seamless


265
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:33,166
experience.


266
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,246
You can set these colors by


267
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:37,666
modifying properties on


268
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,176
SFSafariViewController.


269
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,785
To set the color of bars


270
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:43,436
surrounding web content you can


271
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,126
use preferredBarTintColor.


272
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,066
And to set the color of the


273
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,496
controls shown here, you can use


274
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:51,136
preferredControlTintColor.


275
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:54,296
Now let me tell you about an


276
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:55,046
improvement to


277
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,396
preferredBarTintColor on iOS 11.


278
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:59,106
This is my app.


279
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,406
I'm using my favorite shade of


280
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,626
red for its bar color.


281
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:04,126
Here's what it would look like


282
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,606
if I set that exact same shade


283
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:06,786
of red to Safari View


284
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:09,866
Controller's bar color on iOS


285
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:10,606
10.


286
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,206
As you can see, they don't quite


287
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,406
match up.


288
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:15,756
And it doesn't feel exactly like


289
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,586
my app.


290
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,466
It looks great, but it's not as


291
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:19,496
close as it could be.


292
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:22,156
Let's take a look on iOS 11.


293
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:25,006
Now, the bar colors match up.


294
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,676
It's just as if I was setting


295
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:28,406
the bar color on a standard UI


296
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,436
navigation bar or UI toolbar.


297
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:32,396
So, it looks really great and it


298
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,826
fits well within my app.


299
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,516
Now, I'm delighted to invite my


300
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,156
colleague Louie Livon-Bemel to


301
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,976
the stage to show you just how


302
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:43,866
easy it is to get Safari View


303
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,326
Controller matching your app's


304
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:45,686
style.


305
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:46,816
Thank you.


306
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:52,836
[ Applause ]


307
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,186
>> Thanks, Chelsea.


308
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:57,356
Hi, I'm Louie, I'm an engineer


309
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:58,986
on the Safari team, and I'm


310
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:00,576
really excited to show you just


311
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,256
how easy it is to customize


312
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,946
Safari View Controller to match


313
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,606
your app style.


314
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:10,756
I'm working on an all new


315
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,806
version of my app, Pizza Finder.


316
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,496
It's the best app for finding


317
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:17,016
great pizza near you when you're


318
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,486
working on or even watching a


319
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:18,866
demo.


320
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:22,816
Like many of your apps, this app


321
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,626
uses a standard UI Navigation


322
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:25,196
Controller.


323
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,176
I've got a list of pizza places


324
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,396
here, and when I tap one, a new


325
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,216
view comes in from right to left


326
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,366
with more details.


327
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:34,986
The default presentation of


328
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:37,136
Safari View Controller is a lot


329
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,806
like this.


330
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,476
When I tap on the website,


331
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:41,826
Safari View Controller came in


332
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,936
from right to left just like a


333
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,166
UI Navigation Controller.


334
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,486
Users can even interactively


335
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,566
edge swipe back when they're


336
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,206
done browsing.


337
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,656
So, this is great.


338
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:56,116
I have a very standard UI here


339
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,646
that my users are used to from


340
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,706
Safari and any other app that's


341
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,036
using Safari View Controller on


342
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:01,606
the system.


343
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,326
Users even get really advanced


344
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:07,436
features like in the Share Sheet


345
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:08,536
all the activities they're used


346
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:10,476
to from Safari and the powerful


347
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:11,846
third-party extensions that


348
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:12,696
they're used to using.


349
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:15,276
However, this isn't perfect.


350
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,246
It sort of feels like you're


351
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:18,246
somewhere else.


352
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,236
You might be in another app or


353
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,696
somewhere else on the system or


354
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,486
somewhere else in my app, it


355
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,156
doesn't, it's not clear that


356
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:26,126
you're still within Pizza


357
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:26,596
Finder.


358
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,256
So, I want to show you how to


359
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:29,036
improve this.


360
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:32,286
Here's where I'm presenting


361
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:33,516
Safari View Controller in my


362
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:33,776
app.


363
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:34,956
It's really simple.


364
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,356
All you need to do to adopt


365
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,036
Safari View Controller is do two


366
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:38,576
things.


367
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,356
The first one, is create a


368
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,596
Safari View Controller using the


369
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:44,176
URL that you want to lead to.


370
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,356
The second thing you need to do


371
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,166
is present it.


372
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,616
And that's it, that's how you


373
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:50,806
adapt Safari View Controller.


374
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,356
But let's make a few changes.


375
00:11:53,986 --> 00:11:57,886
So, I've done two different


376
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:58,316
things here.


377
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:00,516
The first one is setting the


378
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:02,476
preferredBarTintColor to the


379
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:03,606
same bar color I'm using


380
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:04,406
elsewhere in my app.


381
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,196
In this case it's that orangish


382
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:06,766
red color.


383
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:09,666
Second thing I'm doing is


384
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:09,986
setting the


385
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,846
preferredControlTintColor to the


386
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:13,376
same control color I'm using


387
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:14,896
elsewhere in my app, in this


388
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:15,676
case that's white.


389
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:18,136
So, I'll rebuild and I'll show


390
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,556
you how these changes affect


391
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:20,216
Pizza Finder.


392
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:27,196
Now when I look at a pizza


393
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,136
place, and go to their website,


394
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,446
Safari View Controller matches


395
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,016
my app's branding and it's


396
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:34,326
really obvious that I'm still


397
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:35,456
within Pizza Finder.


398
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:36,366
It doesn't feel like I'm


399
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:37,166
somewhere else.


400
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,646
That's just how easy it is to


401
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:41,256
customize Safari View Controller


402
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:42,996
to match your app style and get


403
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,086
your app's branding.


404
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:45,716
Thank you so much, and I'll now


405
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:46,746
hand it back over to Chelsea.


406
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:53,056
[ Applause ]


407
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:54,276
>> Thanks, Louie.


408
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:57,186
Louie just showed you how easy


409
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,346
it is to get his app's branding


410
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,666
in Safari View Controller.


411
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:02,406
With just a couple lines of


412
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,716
code, he had Safari View


413
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,096
Controller up and running with


414
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:06,446
his app's color scheme.


415
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,896
We can't wait to see how good


416
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:11,436
Safari View Controller's color


417
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:14,866
schemes look on your app.


418
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:17,126
Now, I'd like to talk to you


419
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:18,646
about some improvements that


420
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:19,746
we've made to Safari View


421
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:21,476
Controller on iOS 11.


422
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,166
There are five key improvements


423
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,446
that I'm going to talk about.


424
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,326
You may have heard about the new


425
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,216
feature on iOS 11, Drag and


426
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:31,486
Drop.


427
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,006
I'm excited to let you know that


428
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:36,096
on iOS 11, Safari View


429
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,856
Controller has Drag and Drop out


430
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:38,446
of the box.


431
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,926
Users can easily drag URLs out


432
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,606
of Safari View Controller into


433
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,276
other apps.


434
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,686
Now I'd like to talk to you


435
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,586
about some improvements to how


436
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:50,316
Status Bar styling works in


437
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:51,486
Safari View Controller.


438
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,346
When presenting Safari View


439
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:56,796
Controller in some apps, the


440
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,486
Status Bar can become difficult


441
00:13:58,486 --> 00:13:58,876
to read.


442
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:01,976
It's hard to even notice here,


443
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,966
but I have a dark purple bar,


444
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:05,846
with a black Status Bar text on


445
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,516
top, and it's illegible.


446
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,296
Ideally, you'd want white Status


447
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:13,386
Bar text so that the user can


448
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,956
easily read the Status Bar, but


449
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,946
if you just hard code a specific


450
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,746
Status Bar style, you're not


451
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,446
fully fixing the problem.


452
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:25,176
Other views can be presented in


453
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:27,156
Safari View Controller such as


454
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:29,256
the Messages extension, or a


455
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:30,276
full-screen video.


456
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,806
Here the user is sharing to


457
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,466
Messages so the white Status Bar


458
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,546
style that's been hard coded is


459
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:39,156
illegible over the white bar of


460
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:40,196
the Messages view.


461
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,716
The bottom line is that other


462
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,676
views can be presented in Safari


463
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,396
View Controller.


464
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,106
Safari View Controller has


465
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,006
improvements to better adapt the


466
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:53,866
Status Bar style when other


467
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:56,036
views are presented on iOS 11.


468
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,806
In order to allow this to work,


469
00:14:59,056 --> 00:14:59,846
you'll want to use


470
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,436
UIViewController-based Status


471
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:02,156
Bar appearance.


472
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,306
This has been the recommendation


473
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,576
for all apps since iOS 7.


474
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,796
To do this, you can set


475
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:10,256
UIViewControllerBased


476
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,106
StatusBarAppearance to yes in


477
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,356
your app's Info.plist.


478
00:15:14,636 --> 00:15:16,086
This will ensure that the Status


479
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,766
Bar remains legible even when


480
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,286
other views are presented in


481
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,326
Safari View Controller.


482
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:24,156
Now I'd like to tell you about


483
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,106
another improvement, but it


484
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:27,616
requires a bit of background.


485
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:30,046
So, I'd like to explain a


486
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,736
scenario in Safari to start.


487
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,626
A common experience on the web


488
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,276
is checkout with a third-party


489
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:36,726
service.


490
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:39,186
Here I have a page that's asking


491
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:40,836
me to checkout using Example


492
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:41,336
Checkout.


493
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:45,986
When I tap buy now in Safari, a


494
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,256
new tab is opened and I'm able


495
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,516
to complete my payment.


496
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,626
When I tap Buy Now on Example


497
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:56,316
Checkout, I -- and complete my


498
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:59,526
payment, the tab that was opened


499
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,006
is closed and I'm back on the


500
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,466
store site that I was on.


501
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,066
And the store knows that I've


502
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,556
completed my payment.


503
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:07,646
This is an example of what


504
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:09,326
happens when a webpage calls


505
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:11,466
window.open and subsequently


506
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:12,736
calls window.close.


507
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,246
It previously wasn't supported


508
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:16,446
in Safari View Controller


509
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:17,666
because Safari View Controller


510
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,656
doesn't have tabs.


511
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,476
But on iOS 11 Safari View


512
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,346
Controller supports window.open.


513
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:27,056
[applause] It's pretty great,


514
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:29,266
yeah.


515
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,706
The way that this now works is


516
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:34,406
in Safari View Controller when I


517
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,306
tap Buy Now a new, I've


518
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,076
navigated forward instead of


519
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:39,856
opening a new tab.


520
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,966
Once I've completed my payment


521
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:45,216
after tapping Buy Now, I'm


522
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,666
navigated back to the page, the


523
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,236
domain I was on and the page


524
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:51,626
knows that I've completed my


525
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:52,166
payment.


526
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,326
So, I get a confirmation in


527
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:55,486
Safari View Controller.


528
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,346
This is new to iOS 11.


529
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:02,126
Now I'd like to talk about some


530
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:05,026
privacy improvements on iOS 11


531
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,606
in Safari View Controller.


532
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,126
Browsing the web in your app is


533
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,276
different than browsing the web


534
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,066
in other apps.


535
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,116
It's different than browsing the


536
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,246
web in Safari.


537
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:19,576
I sometimes want to use


538
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:20,996
different accounts when browsing


539
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:21,935
the web in different apps.


540
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:24,465
For some apps, I'll use my work


541
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:25,786
account and for other apps I'll


542
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:27,026
use my personal account.


543
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,456
On iOS 11, Safari View


544
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:31,786
Controller will have a separate


545
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:34,156
persistent data store in each


546
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,596
app that it's used in.


547
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:38,176
This means that cookies, local


548
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:39,816
storage, and other browsing data


549
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:41,726
will be contained within your


550
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:43,486
app and scoped to your app.


551
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,966
And this means that the user


552
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,526
won't automatically be logged in


553
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,856
to whatever accounts they were


554
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,326
logged into in Safari.


555
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,476
What this does is it will


556
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:56,456
prevent cross-app tracking of


557
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:58,496
user's browsing activity that


558
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,216
you and your users may not have


559
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:01,326
even been aware about.


560
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:04,006
And ultimately, it helps keep


561
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,036
users' browsing activity private


562
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:08,626
and scoped within your app.


563
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,456
Now I'd like to talk about a


564
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,086
change to Private Browsing in


565
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,266
Safari View Controller.


566
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:16,826
Now that Safari View Controller


567
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:19,126
has its own separate persistent


568
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:21,426
data store for each app, it's


569
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,026
browsing mode is no longer tied


570
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:25,496
to Safari's this means that I


571
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:27,206
now longer get the following


572
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:28,606
frustrating experience.


573
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,576
I'm browsing the web in Safari


574
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,946
in Private Mode.


575
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,236
Time passes and later that day


576
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,866
after I've forgotten that I was


577
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,116
even in Private Mode, I go to my


578
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,886
favorite app that opens links


579
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,296
using Safari View Controller.


580
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:46,846
Safari View Controller is


581
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,176
presented in Private Mode once I


582
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:51,306
open a link and that's confusing


583
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:52,306
to me because I didn't


584
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:54,116
intentionally tell it to open in


585
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,116
Private Browsing Mode.


586
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,136
So, on iOS 11 now that Safari


587
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,796
View Controller has its own


588
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:02,496
browsing mode, it's no longer


589
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:03,726
tied to Safari's.


590
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,556
That means that your apps' color


591
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:08,446
scheme will be used more often.


592
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:14,016
Now I'd like to tell you about


593
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,786
three new APIs that we've added


594
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:17,916
so you can really tailor Safari


595
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,726
View Controller to fit your


596
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:20,916
app's experience.


597
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,556
First I'd like to talk to about


598
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:25,926
how you can now customize the


599
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:27,556
Dismiss button of Safari View


600
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:28,146
Controller.


601
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:31,826
Language is very important when


602
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:33,436
conveying intent to the user.


603
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,176
The standard Dismiss button


604
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,176
style for Safari View Controller


605
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:38,786
is Done.


606
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:40,906
This works really well for a


607
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:42,406
standard browsing case, because


608
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:43,536
the user can browse through a


609
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,006
bunch of different web pages and


610
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,216
then when they're finished


611
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,166
browsing tap Done to indicate


612
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:48,876
that they've ended their


613
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:49,796
browsing session.


614
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,896
On iOS 11 we've added two new


615
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:55,606
options that this Dismiss button


616
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:56,386
can take on.


617
00:19:57,286 --> 00:19:58,856
The first of those options is


618
00:19:58,856 --> 00:19:59,416
Cancel.


619
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:01,926
I think Cancel makes a lot of


620
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,316
sense when I'm getting my user's


621
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,946
authenticated to a third-party


622
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:05,396
service.


623
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,866
The user will know that if they


624
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,516
tap that button, they're not


625
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:10,726
really authenticating with my


626
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,336
service, they're cancelling the


627
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,126
transaction.


628
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:16,336
The other new style is Close.


629
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,356
This makes sense if I'm


630
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:19,776
presenting some transient web


631
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:21,646
content to the user, perhaps a


632
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,096
Terms of Service page.


633
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:25,436
I'm giving them a page where


634
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:26,486
they're probably not likely to


635
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,316
follow other links, so they'll


636
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,326
just Close once they've finished


637
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:34,936
reading what I've presented to


638
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:35,386
them.


639
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:36,306
Now I'd like, or the Dismiss


640
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:39,026
button style is a property on


641
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:40,466
SFSafariViewController.


642
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,966
As I mentioned it has these two


643
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:43,696
new options.


644
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:45,586
The default style will be Done


645
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:46,946
but you can choose which ever


646
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,886
style best fits your use case of


647
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,006
Safari View Controller.


648
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:52,936
The value can even be changed


649
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,266
while Safari View Controller is


650
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,726
presented, which Louie will


651
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:56,666
demonstrate later.


652
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,666
Now I'd like to talk to you


653
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,136
about a customization you can


654
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,866
make to the Share Sheet in


655
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:04,976
Safari View Controller.


656
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,536
Let's say I'm presenting a login


657
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:10,426
flow to the user.


658
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:12,946
When the tap the share button


659
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:13,886
they have all these different


660
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,816
actions that they can take, but


661
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,836
some of them don't really make


662
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:17,806
sense in this case.


663
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:19,736
They're probably not going to


664
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,196
send the page somewhere else


665
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:22,626
because it might disrupt the


666
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,646
login flow and the login might


667
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:25,726
now even work outside of the


668
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:26,566
context of my app.


669
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:31,676
Here, I've filtered out, so this


670
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:33,786
is what the actions that I don't


671
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:34,276
want to show.


672
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,796
On iOS 11 we're giving the


673
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,566
ability to filter out some of


674
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,106
these UIActivityTypes.


675
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,896
Here, I've filtered out AirDrop,


676
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,456
Mail, and Messages because my


677
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:47,926
users don't need them in this


678
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:48,256
case.


679
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,346
You make recognize this API on


680
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:53,916
UIActivityViewController.


681
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,816
It allows you to set an array of


682
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,636
UIActivityTypes that the user


683
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,446
doesn't need on your


684
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:01,956
UIActivityViewController.


685
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,626
We realize that if you're


686
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,026
implementing your own in-app web


687
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:06,636
browsing experience, you'd have


688
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:08,056
the ability to customize the


689
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,266
Share Sheet in this way.


690
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:12,076
So, in iOS 11 we're exposing


691
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,546
this same ability on


692
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,576
SFSafariViewControllerDelegate


693
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,846
as a method where you can return


694
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:21,426
an array of UIActivityTypes that


695
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:22,846
you don't want to be presented


696
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:24,806
to the user in the context of


697
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,146
your Safari View Controller.


698
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:29,806
Now, I'd like to talk about Bar


699
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,366
Collapsing in Safari View


700
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:31,916
Controller.


701
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:36,756
Safari View Controller's bars


702
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:38,426
collapse away while in browsing,


703
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:39,906
which lets me really get


704
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,356
immersed in my browsing


705
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:42,086
experience.


706
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,686
However, in some cases this bar


707
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:46,906
collapsing behavior can be


708
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:47,586
frustrating.


709
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:49,836
Let's say I have a login flow.


710
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,316
If bars are collapsed, the


711
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:54,066
Dismiss button gets hidden.


712
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,676
So, it's a bit more difficult to


713
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,276
Dismiss Safari View Controller.


714
00:22:58,656 --> 00:22:59,766
So, in something quick like a


715
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:02,806
login flow, this standard bar


716
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:04,656
collapsing behavior might not


717
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,636
necessarily make sense.


718
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:10,276
On iOS 11, we're allowing you to


719
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:11,476
disable this standard bar


720
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:12,976
collapsing behavior if it best


721
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:13,976
fits your use case.


722
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,366
This will be a new property on


723
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,746
SFSafariViewController


724
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,666
.Configuration which will be


725
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,196
passed into Safari View


726
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:23,656
Controller's initializer.


727
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:27,246
It's best to leave this enabled


728
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,466
if your use case is show user's


729
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:31,986
browsing, or user's content that


730
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:33,206
they should really get immersed


731
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:33,456
in.


732
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,686
But, if it's important to always


733
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,246
have the Dismiss button shown,


734
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,486
you can disable this property.


735
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:44,036
Now, I'd like to welcome Louie


736
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,476
back to the stage to show you


737
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:47,266
how easy it is to use these new


738
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,456
APIs to tailor for his app's


739
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:50,096
experience.


740
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:56,546
[ Applause ]


741
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:57,696
>> Thanks, Chelsea.


742
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,286
I'm thrilled to show you how


743
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:01,746
easy it is to customize Safari


744
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,286
View Controller using these new


745
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,216
APIs and I'm going to give you a


746
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:06,806
sneak peak at the next app I'm


747
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:07,416
working on.


748
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,076
It's another pizza related app,


749
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,936
so I hope that's not too cheesy.


750
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:16,826
[laughter] This is a social app


751
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,226
called Pizza Stories.


752
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:20,086
It allows you to share all the


753
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,596
pizza related news in your life


754
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:23,106
in a visual format with your


755
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,246
friends and family.


756
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,656
By default, it when you're not


757
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:30,276
logged in, you get a list of


758
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:31,626
pizza brands that are sharing


759
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:32,486
some stories.


760
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:34,956
However, to get the best


761
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,016
experience out of this app,


762
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,256
you'll want to log-in.


763
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:40,756
I don't want users to have to


764
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,876
create and maintain a list of


765
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:44,766
their friends in my app, and I


766
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,016
don't own a social network that


767
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:48,336
already has this, so I want them


768
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,736
to be able to use an existing


769
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:51,146
list that they've already used


770
00:24:51,426 --> 00:24:53,366
and created all of their friends


771
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:55,766
on an existing social network.


772
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,196
I'm using Safari View Controller


773
00:24:58,336 --> 00:24:59,436
to let them log-in and


774
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:00,786
authenticate against this social


775
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:01,176
network.


776
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:04,646
I tap Log In, Safari View


777
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:06,206
Controller is shown and let's my


778
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:08,286
users log in with SampleChat a


779
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:09,836
really popular demo social


780
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:10,266
network.


781
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,336
You may have noticed that Safari


782
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:15,116
View Controller came in from


783
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,226
right to left like a


784
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,066
UINavigationController.


785
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:19,896
My app doesn't use this


786
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:21,736
paradigm, so that feels a little


787
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:22,156
weird.


788
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:25,706
I have already made it so that


789
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,076
Safari View Controller takes on


790
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:30,596
the colors of my app, but the


791
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,156
transition didn't feel right for


792
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,106
my app.


793
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:35,946
Similarly, saying Done doesn't


794
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:36,896
really make sense here.


795
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:38,446
I want to communicate to my


796
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:40,506
users that tapping this button


797
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,246
will cancel this login session.


798
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:44,596
So, it's clear what's going to


799
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:45,616
happen when they tap it.


800
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,056
And if my users are reading the


801
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:49,486
Terms of Service and they scroll


802
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:51,246
down a little bit, the bars


803
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:51,856
collapse.


804
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:53,856
This might nice in some other


805
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,546
web pages, but here it could


806
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:56,366
just get annoying.


807
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,696
If they want to cancel, it's two


808
00:25:58,696 --> 00:25:59,996
taps away instead of one.


809
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:02,626
So, I'll show you how to improve


810
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:04,176
Safari View Controller to fit


811
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:08,366
this log in a little bit better.


812
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,376
Here's where I'm presenting


813
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:10,466
Safari View Controller.


814
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,336
Like before, it's pretty simple.


815
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:15,126
I'm creating a URL and then


816
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:16,546
passing that to Safari View


817
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:17,636
Controller's initializer.


818
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,326
Customizing the colors as I


819
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,126
showed you before.


820
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,916
And then presenting Safari View


821
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,366
Controller.


822
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:27,146
But let's make some changes.


823
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:28,526
First, let's make sure that the


824
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:29,726
bars don't collapse when they


825
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:30,306
scroll down.


826
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:36,206
So, what I've done here is


827
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:37,666
created a Safari View Controller


828
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,826
configuration object and then


829
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:41,416
set its barCollapsingEnabled


830
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,536
property to false.


831
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,136
This way when they scroll down


832
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,266
the bars won't collapse, they'll


833
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:46,556
still stay full height.


834
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,116
I then pass this in to Safari


835
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,306
View Controller's initializer.


836
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:52,586
Let's make a couple other


837
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,296
changes.


838
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:57,056
I've done two different things


839
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:57,306
here.


840
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:58,786
The first, is setting


841
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:01,206
dismissButtonStyle to Cancel so


842
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:02,626
that the button will say Cancel


843
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:03,726
instead of Done, which is the


844
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:04,216
default.


845
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,646
Second change I've made is


846
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:07,896
slightly more complicated.


847
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:09,266
I'm overriding the


848
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:10,666
transitioningDelegate of Safari


849
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,196
View Controller to myself.


850
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:14,486
Since I haven't implemented any


851
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:15,266
of the methods of


852
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,576
UITransitioningDelegate, I'm


853
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:18,196
just going to get the standard


854
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:20,346
system default behavior where a


855
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:21,606
view comes in from bottom to


856
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,036
top.


857
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,456
I'll rebuild and show you how


858
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:25,816
this works in Pizza Stories.


859
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:32,286
Now when I tap Log In, Safari


860
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,436
View Controller came in from


861
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:34,256
bottom to top.


862
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,426
Now you may notice here, the


863
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:37,216
view is blank.


864
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:38,726
This is a bug on Seed 1.


865
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,136
If you do run into this, I'll


866
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,026
show you how to fix it.


867
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:42,296
You can either pull down


868
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,206
Notification Center or press the


869
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,506
Home button and then go back in


870
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:49,636
and the page loads.


871
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:51,746
So, in addition to the new


872
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:54,116
presentation, the Dismiss button


873
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,626
says Cancel to better indicate


874
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,946
to my users what tapping this


875
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:57,326
will do.


876
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,506
And when I scroll down, the bars


877
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,186
don't squish.


878
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:03,376
So, we're almost there.


879
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:04,946
However, there's one more change


880
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:05,416
I want to make.


881
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,306
Right now, it makes sense for


882
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:09,466
the button to say Cancel.


883
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:11,816
But, when my users successfully


884
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,386
logged in, it shouldn't say


885
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:13,916
Cancel.


886
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:15,106
I want to indicate to them that


887
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,586
it's okay to dismiss after that.


888
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,616
So, as Chelsea mentioned before,


889
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,556
what's really cool about this


890
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:21,976
property is it can be changed


891
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:23,256
even after I've already


892
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,296
presented Safari View


893
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:24,816
Controller.


894
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:27,846
When my user logs in with


895
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:29,866
SampleChat, they redirect to a


896
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,546
URL scheme that my app handles.


897
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:34,646
That gets handled in my


898
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,306
AppDelegate in this method.


899
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:37,996
And what I'm doing here is I'm


900
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:39,216
making sure that there's a log


901
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,876
in token to indicate that the


902
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:42,796
user's authenticated, then I'm


903
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:44,106
sending a message to elsewhere


904
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:47,246
in my app giving it that token.


905
00:28:48,286 --> 00:28:49,366
I'm handling that here.


906
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:51,546
And I'm doing that because I


907
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,556
like to keep this code


908
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:53,226
organized.


909
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:54,376
I want everything related to


910
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:56,256
Login in one place rather than


911
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:57,206
having it in a few different


912
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:57,836
places.


913
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,176
Now that I know that the user


914
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:02,106
has successfully logged in, I


915
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,126
can change the


916
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:05,796
dismissButtonStyle of Safari


917
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:07,906
View Controller to Done instead


918
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:08,536
of Cancel.


919
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:11,226
So, I'll rebuild and I'll show


920
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:12,616
you how this all comes together


921
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:13,526
in Pizza Stories.


922
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,566
Now, when I tap Log In, Safari


923
00:29:26,566 --> 00:29:27,246
View Controller is still


924
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,666
presented from bottom to top and


925
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,746
the button initially does say


926
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:30,216
Cancel.


927
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:32,896
With just a couple taps I can


928
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,896
use AutoFill to log in.


929
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:37,716
Now, SampleChat is asking the


930
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:39,856
user if they want to allow this


931
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:41,826
app, in this case Pizza Stories,


932
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,626
to use their account for their


933
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,476
friends list and their email.


934
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:46,956
I'll allow that.


935
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,466
And now that I'm logged in, the


936
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:51,606
Done button, the Dismiss button


937
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,056
has changed to say Done to


938
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:54,636
better indicate to my users it's


939
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:56,426
okay to dismiss now.


940
00:29:57,516 --> 00:30:00,686
[ Applause ]


941
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:04,046
Thanks. So, when I dismiss, now


942
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:05,346
I get all of my friends showing


943
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:06,996
up in my, and I can see all


944
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:07,836
their stories.


945
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:09,596
This might make me crave some


946
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:10,496
pizza later on though.


947
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:14,766
Thanks, and this is how easy it


948
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,106
is to customize Safari View


949
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,946
Controller using the new APIs in


950
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:20,346
iOS 11 to tailor it to your app


951
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:21,546
and make a great log in


952
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:22,266
experience.


953
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:23,876
Thank you so much and I'll hand


954
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:24,656
it back over to Chelsea.


955
00:30:26,516 --> 00:30:30,266
[ Applause ]


956
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:31,746
>> Thanks, Louie.


957
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:33,566
I think Louie is going to making


958
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,026
a lot of dough off that one.


959
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:38,706
[laughter] Louie just showed you


960
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:40,746
how with a few key improvements,


961
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:42,726
he made, he took his log in flow


962
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:43,946
with Safari View Controller to


963
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:44,786
the next level.


964
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,736
He did this by using a custom


965
00:30:47,736 --> 00:30:50,006
presentation style that it felt


966
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,706
more like the presentation style


967
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:52,156
in his app.


968
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:55,286
He changed the Dismiss button to


969
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,256
say Cancel so that users know


970
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,096
that if they tap that button


971
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,566
they'll be cancelling log in


972
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:01,846
with the third-party service


973
00:31:01,846 --> 00:31:03,996
he's asking them to log in with.


974
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:07,066
He turned off bar collapsing.


975
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,646
This way if the user reads the


976
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:10,456
Terms of Service and decides


977
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:11,616
that they don't want to use that


978
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,106
service, they can quickly tap


979
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,716
cancel to exit Safari View


980
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:15,316
Controller.


981
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:19,516
And he changed the button to say


982
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:21,376
Done once the user had allowed


983
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:22,716
access to that third-party


984
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:23,106
service.


985
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:25,176
This way they know that they've


986
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:26,356
finished logging in.


987
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:30,726
One of the main things that we


988
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:31,926
want you to get out of this


989
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:34,316
presentation is that we hear


990
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:34,616
you.


991
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,176
The new APIs that we've talked


992
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:39,356
about today were inspired by


993
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:40,496
feedback from you.


994
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,096
We really encourage you to keep


995
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:45,016
giving us feature requests and


996
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,226
filing bug reports.


997
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:48,506
And also letting us know if


998
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,266
there are any other


999
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,026
customizations you'd like to see


1000
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:52,416
in Safari View Controller.


1001
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,636
So, keep talking to us.


1002
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:00,916
In summary, Safari View


1003
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,786
Controller gives you an easy


1004
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:05,566
in-app web browsing experience.


1005
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:07,026
With just a couple lines of


1006
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,986
code, you can get Safari View


1007
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:10,716
Controller up and running in


1008
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:11,386
your app.


1009
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:14,206
Safari View Controller is


1010
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:15,816
perfect for authenticating with


1011
00:32:15,816 --> 00:32:17,966
third-party services because it


1012
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:19,636
provides a security that users


1013
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,396
need and the features that they


1014
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:24,686
love while getting logged in.


1015
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,876
There are many improvements to


1016
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,476
Safari View Controller on iOS


1017
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:30,056
11.


1018
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:31,806
Safari View Controller's new


1019
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:33,686
look and the new APIs that we've


1020
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,806
introduced can help Safari View


1021
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:37,616
Controller feel at home in your


1022
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:38,053
app.


1023
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,926
If you've taken a look at Safari


1024
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,806
View Controller in the past but


1025
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:45,216
maybe it didn't quite fit your


1026
00:32:45,216 --> 00:32:46,936
use case, we encourage you to


1027
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:47,806
take another look.


1028
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,666
These improvements on iOS 11 and


1029
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:52,546
the APIs that have been added


1030
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:53,786
were inspired by you.


1031
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:55,666
So, we really hope there's


1032
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,756
something in there for you.


1033
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,576

1034
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:02,256
session you can view the page

listed here.


1036
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:06,856
I'd like to tell you about some


1037
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:08,146
related sessions that you might


1038
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:09,096
be interested in.


1039
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,356
These are all available on the


1040

1041
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:15,286
We've talked a lot about getting


1042
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,636
your user authenticated with a


1043
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:18,286
third-party service using Safari


1044
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:18,956
View Controller.


1045
00:33:19,686 --> 00:33:20,546
But if you want to make


1046
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,116
authenticating with your own


1047
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:23,516
service a better experience for


1048
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:24,906
