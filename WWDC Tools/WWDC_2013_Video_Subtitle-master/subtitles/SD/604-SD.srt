1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,526
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:10,906
>> Good afternoon.


3
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:16,245
My name is Madhu Vudali, and I'm
here to introduce iAd Workbench,


4
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:19,856
a new advertising product
for iOS developers.


5
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:25,886
We know that many of you at
the conference are either new


6
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:28,346
to advertising or
never even thought


7
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:29,736
of advertising your apps.


8
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:34,526
So we'll briefly cover why you
should advertise your iOS apps


9
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:38,016
and why you should consider
iAd for your advertising.


10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,206
We'll go over iAd Workbench and
my colleagues, Vineet Gossain


11
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:46,056
and Mike Amirault, will do
a couple of demos for you.


12
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:48,116
So let's jump in.


13
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:53,336
Say you have this beautiful
app that you had developed,


14
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:57,636
your awesome app, and
it's in the App Store


15
00:00:58,596 --> 00:00:59,776
and users might find it.


16
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:04,706
If they know your app, they
might actually search for it


17
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:08,236
or if your app is
featured in any


18
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:11,246
of the App Store's features
like, New & Noteworthy


19
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:15,406
or Editors' Choice, they
might chance upon it.


20
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:19,186
Perhaps your app is in
many of the app collections


21
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,516
that the App Store has.


22
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,606
But consider the
fact that there are


23
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:28,026
over 900,000 apps
in the App Store.


24
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,756
And as Tim Cook pointed out
yesterday, hundred thousand


25
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:35,276
of those got added
just in the last year.


26
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:40,986
So there's a limited opportunity
for your apps to be found


27
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:44,526
in the App Store, but you
want to grow your user base.


28
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:48,976
You obviously built good times
building your app and it's


29
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,456
in the App Store you want
users for your App Store.


30
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:53,096
What do you do?


31
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:57,216
What should you do?


32
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:58,456
You should advertise.


33
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:04,366
With discovery in the App
Store, users find your app.


34
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:07,926
Pretty straightforward but
you're competing with lots


35
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:09,086
of apps in the App Store.


36
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:13,236
But in advertising,
you find your users.


37
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,296
You find the users that are
likely to download your app.


38
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:20,296
With advertising,
you're in control.


39
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:24,726
Obviously discovery and
advertising go hand and hand.


40
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:29,256
But again, with advertising,
you are in control


41
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:32,246
in finding the users
for your app.


42
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:36,446
Finding the users for
whom you built the app.


43
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:40,706
There are many options for
advertising, obviously.


44
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,876
But we're-- you're
an iOS developer


45
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:49,776
and your best option is iAd.


46
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:57,186
We can find users who are likely
to download apps like yours


47
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:59,816
because we know who
those users are.


48
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:01,466
We run the App Store.


49
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:04,336
We get the data from the
App Store and iTunes.


50
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,746
So we can find users for you.


51
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:13,606
Over the last three years, iAd
has been working with hundreds


52
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:16,596
of developers promoting
thousands of apps


53
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,116
and driving hundreds of millions
of visits to the App Store.


54
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:24,826
That's the scale and power of
iAd that we're offering you.


55
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:29,946
We are offering this new
platform for all iOS developers.


56
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,626
We're calling it iAd Workbench.


57
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,946
A do-it-yourself
campaign creation


58
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:37,796
and management application


59
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:42,026
with all the key features
you need for your apps.


60
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:44,546
So let me touch on
a couple of them.


61
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:46,686
Auction Marketplace.


62
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:52,166
With Auction Marketplace
you have CPC and CPA.


63
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,886
So that's cost-per-click
of your ad


64
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:58,116
or cost-per-acquisition
of a user.


65
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:03,496
So you can bid your CPC and
we will not charge you more


66
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:07,326
than that, or if you know
roughly what you would pay


67
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:10,236
for acquiring a user,
you can input that


68
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:13,006
and we will optimize
to achieve that goal.


69
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:17,726
And with audience
targeting, we have two options


70
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:19,466
for you, Auto and Manual.


71
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,286
So we've been operating
for the last three years


72
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:25,286
and we bring you the
power of those learnings


73
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,976
with auto targeting where we
find, or iAd Workbench finds


74
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,776
that right users for your apps.


75
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:35,826
But we also provide many
rich targeting options


76
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,416
and you can use them,
you can find them


77
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,346
through the manual
targeting that we have.


78
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,506
Third thing I want
touch on is ad banners.


79
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:46,416
You need creatives for your ads.


80
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:50,346
If you're working with
the creative agency


81
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:51,886
or you have in-house expertise


82
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:54,666
to develop Ad Creative,
you can upload them.


83
00:04:55,146 --> 00:05:00,586
Or you can use many of the Apple
designed beautiful templates


84
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,396
for your ads.


85
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:04,826
So, all the key features


86
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,926
for your app promotions
are all here.


87
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:14,466
We launched this app yesterday,
this iAdWorkbench.apple.com


88
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,676
and already thousands


89
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,956
of iOS developers have
already started using.


90
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:22,586
Before we go into the
details of iAd Workbench,


91
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:26,646
I want Vineet Gossain to give
you a quick demo of the app.


92
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:28,256
Vineet?


93
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:29,536
>> Great. Thanks Madhu.


94
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,546
Now, as Madhu mentioned, I know
a lot of you guys are brand new


95
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:35,156
to advertising, so I want
to show you guys how quickly


96
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:37,506
and easily you can create
a new ad campaign using the


97
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,196
iAd Workbench.


98
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:39,576
It only takes a few minutes.


99
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,066
For those of you who are more
experienced in advertising,


100
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,856
I'll be back later to
give the demo of some


101
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,046
of the more powerful features


102
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,476
that are offered
by iAd Workbench.


103
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,746
Let's start with a quick
demo of creating a campaign.


104
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:52,156
So this is your Dashboard


105
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,946
when you first log
in to iAd Workbench.


106
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:55,946
We'll click on Create Campaign.


107
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:59,886
And the very first thing you
need to do is you need to choose


108
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:01,436
which app you want to promote.


109
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:02,986
All of your Apps are here.


110
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,616
Let's choose Klara
our productivity app.


111
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:07,436
You give it a campaign name,


112
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,676
Klara Summer Promotion,
and hit Next.


113
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,006
Oops, already exists.


114
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:16,676
OK, Campaign Summer Promotion 2.


115
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:20,846
That one does also exist.


116
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:22,526
OK, sorry.


117
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:24,046
Couple of test runs [laughter].


118
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:27,196
OK, so the next thing you
need to do is you need


119
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,066
to find your audience.


120
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,126
As Madhu mentioned,
we have two options,


121
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:32,346
the Auto option, or
the Manual option.


122
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:36,066
If you choose Manual, you get
several different targeting


123
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:40,826
categories such as device,
gender, age, if you know exactly


124
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,096
which user you want to target.


125
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,196
But for most of you,
your best bet is Auto.


126
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,816
For Auto, iAd will
automatically figure


127
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:50,086
out who are the best
users to show your ad


128
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,676
to at the right time
to maximize downloads.


129
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:57,126
For this campaign, we'll
choose Auto as well.


130
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,436
The next option is
your Flight Dates.


131
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,186
Basically, when your want
your campaign to run,


132
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:04,196
you can time your campaign to
run with the specific promotion


133
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:07,046
or specific holiday, or you
can just have it start today.


134
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:09,126
For this demo, let's
just have it start today.


135
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:12,336
The final piece is entering
your campaign budget.


136
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:15,146
For the budget, that's basically
how much you want to spend


137
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,886
on this campaign over
the life of the campaign.


138
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:20,996
For this demo, we
use 2,500 dollars.


139
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:24,236
But you can go as low as 50.


140
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,736
You can choose the
Daily Spend Goal,


141
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:28,276
if you want to limit how much
you're spending on a daily basis


142
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:29,466
but that field is optional.


143
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:30,966
We'll stick with
the pre-calculation


144
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,586
which evenly spends the budget


145
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,626
across the duration
of the campaign.


146
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:38,476
And then the final option is how
you want to pay for your ads.


147
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,386
You have two options
as Madhu mentioned,


148
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:42,756
CPA or cost-per-acquisition,


149
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:44,486
basically how much
you're willing to pay


150
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:47,046
for each additional
download of your app.


151
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,696
Your other option, CPC,


152
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,456
or cost-per-click is basically
you're giving us the maximum


153
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:56,706
you're willing to pay for
each click on one of your ads.


154
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:59,216
Let's stick with CPA and
we'll put in 2 dollars


155
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,666
and 50 cents as a CPA goal.


156
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:02,676
You can hit this
Calculate button


157
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:05,906
and what we'll do is we'll do
an estimate and give an estimate


158
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,656
of how many expected
impressions or number


159
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,796
of times your ad will
appear in front of users.


160
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:14,466
The expected number of taps, how
many taps you can expect people


161
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,626
to actually have clicked
on your ad and roughly


162
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,196
about how many downloads
you can expect


163
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:20,056
to result from this campaign.


164
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:23,106
You can go in and tweak
these numbers if you--


165
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:26,146
you can go in and tweak the
budget numbers or the CPA goal


166
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,236
if you feel you want
to get more downloads.


167
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:29,526
But let's just stick
for this for now.


168
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,436
We hit Next, and then the
next piece is you have


169
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:36,476
to choose the artwork that you
wish to show to the end users


170
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:37,535
as part of your campaign.


171
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:39,666
We have two options.


172
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:42,256
You can upload your own where
all you need to do is you need


173
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,926
to provide the various artwork
for the devices that you wish


174
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,606
to target, or you have
the option of using one


175
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,036
of our Apple design templates.


176
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,646
Now, each of our templates,


177
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,326
we have five different templates
each with multiple color schemes


178
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:56,646
and each of them is animated.


179
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:59,346
For this campaign,
let's use a JetSet.


180
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:05,136
For each template, you provide
three things, the title, Klara;


181
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:09,646
the message, "Getting
things done,


182
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,686
faster" and a call to action.


183
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,646
We'll do download now.


184
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:19,026
You can replay the animation,
so you can see what it will look


185
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,616
like to the end users and you
enter in everything just once


186
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:25,226
and we'll automatically
create the templates for each


187
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:28,316
of the devices that
you wish to target.


188
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:33,396
So, in this case we created
both iPhone and iPad banners.


189
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,896
If we're happy with that
we give it a banner name,


190
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:40,676
Klara JetSet, and hit Next.


191
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:46,506
And now, the final piece
is the Banner Summary.


192
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,356
On the Banner Summary,
you can choose


193
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:50,856
to create additional banners if
you so desire in case you want


194
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,946
to compare how one banner
does against another.


195
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:55,756
But for this demo, we'll stick
with just a single banner.


196
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,446
Now, the final step is
the Campaign Summary.


197
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:01,056
Within the Campaign Summary,
this is your final review,


198
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,476
make sure everything is OK.


199
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:06,336
Confirm your budget, 2,500
dollars, our CPA goal


200
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:10,216
of 2 dollars and 50
cents, our Klara banner,


201
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:12,226
we hit Submit and you're done.


202
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,926
Since it's-- there you go.


203
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:17,976
So, your campaign is
created and quick and easy,


204
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:18,706
and you're ready to go.


205
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:21,136
Back to you Madhu.


206
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,416
[ Applause ]


207
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,796
>> That was awesome.


208
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,336
Thank you Vineet.


209
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:30,806
I was certainly timing him
and it was about five minutes


210
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,356
and that's the fastest
he's done.


211
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:33,726
So that's a new record Vineet.


212
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:38,206
So, let's go into an
overview of iAd Workbench.


213
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:41,226
So, we want to cover
three topics: one,


214
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:44,986
how you can get started; two,
how you can create campaigns;


215
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:48,456
and three, how you can manage
the performance of the campaigns


216
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,716
that you have created.


217
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,446
Getting started.


218
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:53,566
Getting started is very easy.


219
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:56,506
You log in, you sign up
and setup your payment.


220
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,556
Log-in with your
developer credentials.


221
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:03,136
Sign up to the terms and
conditions of iAd Workbench


222
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:05,206
with a new service from Apple


223
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,586
and you just have a different
terms and conditions,


224
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,576
and you setup your payment.


225
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,336
We accept major credit cards


226
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,736
or you can also apply
for a line of credit.


227
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,106
You're done with your sign up.


228
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,716
Next, you create Campaigns.


229
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:26,956
Vineet went through a fairly
quick campaign creation process.


230
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,436
Let's go a little deeper
in each of these steps.


231
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,136
Selecting an app.


232
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:35,146
So every campaign is
anchored around an app


233
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,596
because that's what's
your promoting.


234
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,516
So, when you sign
up as a developer,


235
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,506
all your apps are already here.


236
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:43,826
So, you pick the app
you want to promote,


237
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:47,146
and you give your campaign
a name and you hit Next.


238
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:49,366
So, your campaign is
essentially the first step


239
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:52,206
of your campaign
creation is done.


240
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,456
Next step is selecting
an audience.


241
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:59,806
In the demo that we saw, we have
two options, Auto and Manual.


242
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,896
With Auto, you get the
optimized audience selection


243
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:04,986
from iAd Workbench.


244
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,166
What do we mean by that?


245
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,336
It means that iAd Workbench
finds the right user


246
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:13,266
at the right time, on the
right device in the right app


247
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:15,346
to maximize the downloads
for you.


248
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:17,726
Recall that I mentioned
that we've been operating


249
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:20,196
for over three years,
you're really benefiting


250
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:22,846
from those learnings when
you choose this option.


251
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:27,636
The other option is the
manual targeting option.


252
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:31,226
In this case iAd Workbench
provides you the targeting


253
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:34,236
options and you picked
what's best for you.


254
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:38,026
You still get the benefit
of the optimization except


255
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,406
that you've given us
the starting point


256
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:41,366
for the optimization.


257
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:45,786
Let's drill into what
are the various manual


258
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:46,756
targeting options.


259
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:51,066
On the left hand side are the
various basic targeting options.


260
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,246
So gender, age, various
age buckets, geotargeting,


261
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:58,396
State and DMA for now,
and day of week targeting.


262
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:01,106
These are basic options
for advertising.


263
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,666
On the right hand
side, you can--


264
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,166
you start with device targeting,


265
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,436
you can target all the iOS
devices that Apple makes.


266
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:12,476
So iPhone, iPod and
iPad and iPod touch.


267
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:16,316
Next I want to drill I little
bit into user preferences.


268
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:20,006
This is one of the most powerful
features that we provide you.


269
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:25,276
So with user preferences,
you target users based


270
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:29,276
on what they download in
iTunes and the App Store.


271
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:34,066
So at the top here, hope you
can read that, you have apps,


272
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:37,226
movies, music, books and so on.


273
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:41,076
So what does this showing
you is what-- if you tar--


274
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:44,406
choose this option, you're
targeting users based


275
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,376
on what they download
in the App Store.


276
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:50,296
Actual downloads, not just
likes, actual downloads.


277
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:51,256
Think about that.


278
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:55,716
If you're a game
developer and you want


279
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:59,166
to reach users who've
already downloaded games


280
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,126
and shown preference for
games, you can do that here.


281
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:07,286
Or let's say your game
appeals to action movie fans,


282
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:10,826
you can combine that
with a movie preference


283
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:11,856
for action movies.


284
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:13,866
That's the power you're getting.


285
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:18,256
We're using the data from
iTunes as well as the App Store


286
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:21,626
to find the right
user for your apps.


287
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,906
For our example app Klara,
which is a productivity app,


288
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,346
we're just choosing
business, finance,


289
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,416
productivity and utilities.


290
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:33,196
The next preference,


291
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:35,316
next targeting option
is app channels.


292
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:37,416
Here you're asking the question,


293
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:39,636
where do you want
your ad to run?


294
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:43,396
What you see here is the
taxonomy in the App Store.


295
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:47,426
You're determining, what's
the context for your ad.


296
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:51,116
You can browse the App Store
and see what this context mean.


297
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:54,106
So when you when you
choose these options,


298
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:57,236
you're determining, or you're
deciding what's the most


299
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,426
relevant context for your ads?


300
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:02,146
For Klara, which is
a productivity app


301
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,786
and fairly broad
based, we've chosen most


302
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:06,866
of the app channels
that we have here.


303
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:11,016
Your app may not me relevant
in all of these channels,


304
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:12,956
so that's a decision
that you need to make.


305
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,046
The more channels you pick,


306
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,756
the greater the reach
for your campaign.


307
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:22,016
The last option we
offer you is App Rating.


308
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:26,476
Some of you might have apps that
are not necessarily appropriate


309
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,696
in contexts that are 17+.


310
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,266
So, you can with the fair--


311
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,436
with the simple filter
you can exclude apps


312
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:36,966
that are 17+ from
your campaigns.


313
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,676
So these are the targeting
options that we have


314
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:44,346
under manual targeting,
and the burden is on you


315
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,906
to pick what's best for you.


316
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:50,696
You always, obviously, have the
optimization that comes with it.


317
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:53,136
But you can also
pick the Auto Option


318
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:56,246
where iAd Workbench does
the heavy lifting for you


319
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:59,146
to find the right
users for your app.


320
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:06,846
So two steps down, the third
step is to set a budget.


321
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:09,616
You're answering three
questions, how long do you want


322
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:11,836
to run your campaign,
how much do you want


323
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,166
to spend and at what price?


324
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:19,826
How long? So you're essentially
determining what the start date


325
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:20,906
and end date of a campaign.


326
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,306
You need to set the
duration of your campaign.


327
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:26,316
By default a campaign
starts today.


328
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:29,866
But you can pick any date
range that is relevant to you.


329
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:33,696
Maybe you're launching an update
for your product or your app.


330
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:35,026
You can pick a date for that.


331
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:38,426
Or perhaps you want to
coincide with back to school


332
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,036
or Black Friday, whatever.


333
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,286
You can choose these
options from here.


334
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:46,226
The next question you're
answering is how much?


335
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,706
You're setting a budget
and a daily spend goal.


336
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,736
A budget is what
you're willing to spend


337
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,206
for the entire campaign.


338
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:55,656
And the daily spend
goal is a way for you


339
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:59,836
to control the pacing of your
campaign during the entire


340
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:02,336
campaign-- for the duration
of the campaign, sorry.


341
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:07,086
And now we're answering
the question what price?


342
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,496
Two options that we mentioned
before, cost-per-click


343
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:14,366
where you're inputting the
maximum that you're willing


344
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,356
to pay for a click, so
when there's somebody taps


345
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:19,996
on your ad, that's the
maximum you're willing to pay.


346
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:23,445
We will not charge you more
than that, that's your bid.


347
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:27,415
Or you can indicate a
cost-per-acquisition goal,


348
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:28,306
a CPA goal.


349
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:33,656
Here you have a rough idea as to
what you are be willing to pay


350
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:37,306
to acquire a user, or for
download from the App Store.


351
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,846
You input that and iAd Workbench
optimizes to that goal.


352
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,896
So you have CPA and CPC
that you can choose.


353
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:48,656
Now you've answered
all three questions


354
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:51,056
and we've provide you
three answers there.


355
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:55,096
We provide you the impressions,
the taps, and the downloads,


356
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,496
as an estimate for
all your settings.


357
00:17:57,496 --> 00:18:01,386
So the targeting that
you've chosen, the duration


358
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:03,426
that you've chosen, the
budget that you've chosen,


359
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:05,896
and your bid all determine
these three numbers.


360
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,546
We also have a nifty
gauge next to the numbers.


361
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:12,976
The numbers, the gauge
essentially indicates the


362
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:16,006
numbers or your settings
in the context


363
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:17,666
of what's available overall.


364
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:21,446
In this case, the needle is all
the way to the left telling me


365
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,166
that if I had more budget,
meaning if I had more


366
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,756
than 10,000 dollars to spend,


367
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,456
I could substantially increase
the number of users for my app.


368
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:34,096
But you-- for now, this
is what you get, OK?


369
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:37,346
So, three steps down, last step


370
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,196
or the fourth step
is adding banners.


371
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:43,046
As Vineet pointed out,
you can upload banners.


372
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:47,936
So if you're-- if you
work with creative agency


373
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:51,086
or you have in-house
expertise to create banners,


374
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:53,256
you can upload them
for all the devices


375
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:55,836
that you're targeting,
and you're all set.


376
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:01,376
But many of you might not have
access to creative agencies


377
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:03,726
and may not want to spend
even for all of that.


378
00:19:04,316 --> 00:19:07,016
You get the benefit of
Apple designed beautiful


379
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:07,896
templates here.


380
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,826
The templates have
been designed to ensure


381
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:13,516
that your app is
highlighted in the banners.


382
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:17,776
So we have five templates,
each with five colors.


383
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:23,186
So you pick a template,
you give it a title,


384
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:29,096
you give it a message, and
you give it a call to action.


385
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,036
So all-- basically three
things that you need to do


386
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:34,456
for your banner and we
take care of the rest.


387
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:38,356
As Vineet pointed out you
can see a quick preview


388
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:41,866
of the various sizes
that you're getting


389
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:43,896
from the one banner
that you selected.


390
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:46,886
These are the various sizes
and the various devices


391
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:48,096
that you're targeting.


392
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:51,486
If you want to see
how the ads look,


393
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:55,536
appear on the actual devices,
you can send an email directly


394
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:58,586
from the application,
and using iAd Tester,


395
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:01,686
you can see how your ad
appears on the devices.


396
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:02,766
Pretty powerful.


397
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:08,286
Last step is submitting
the campaign.


398
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:13,056
You get on a single page all
the options that you've chosen.


399
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,936
You obviously see the app,
the name of the campaign


400
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:18,146
that you created, the
various targeting option


401
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:20,456
that you've chosen, as
well as the banners.


402
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:24,156
When you hit Submit,
your campaign goes


403
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,246
into the creative
approval process at Apple.


404
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:29,876
So that's campaign creation.


405
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:34,276
Now when you create campaigns,
obviously you're interested


406
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,026
in understanding how
they're performing


407
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,296
in the App Store,
in our marketplace.


408
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:43,406
You want to understand how
many downloads you're getting.


409
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:46,296
You're spending good money
to acquire those downloads,


410
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:49,676
and you perhaps have chosen
various targeting options


411
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:53,836
or various banners for your
app, for your campaigns,


412
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:54,816
and you really want


413
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:56,616
to understand the
performance of them.


414
00:20:56,886 --> 00:21:00,586
So we provide you a
Dashboard and drill downs.


415
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:05,436
Dashboard gives you, on the
left hand side, a quick view


416
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:09,466
of what's going on in your
application for all your apps.


417
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:12,946
So you can see all the
apps and the campaigns


418
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:14,856
that you've created
for those apps.


419
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,546
You have, at a quick glance,


420
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:20,476
understand how those
various campaigns are doing.


421
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:23,716
You can initiate a new
campaign as Vineet did from--


422
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:24,946
directly from the Dashboard.


423
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,756
On the right hand side,
you have drill downs.


424
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:30,526
Again, you get granular
reporting


425
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:32,456
for all the options
that you've chosen.


426
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:35,886
You have the various targeting
options that you've chosen.


427
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:37,346
You have also the
various banners


428
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,276
that you've created
for your campaign.


429
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:43,856
You can do understand how these
two perhaps targeting options


430
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:44,836
are performing.


431
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:47,256
Or you could also
trend them overtime.


432
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:52,046
Lots of rich data
comparison tools as well


433
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:55,616
as insightful visuals for
you on the drill downs.


434
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,566
Rather than me talk about it,
let's have Vineet come back


435
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,996
and give us a demo of
managing performance.


436
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:02,836
Vineet?


437
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:04,616
>> Great. Thanks Madhu.


438
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,916
So yeah, now we've
created our campaign.


439
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:09,666
But now the question
is, how do you ensure


440
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,526
that your campaign is
doing as well as it could?


441
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,896
How do you ensure you're
maximizing your downloads?


442
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,456
Let's go to the Dashboard.


443
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,326
On the Dashboard, you see
the list of the campaigns


444
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:20,126
that are currently running.


445
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,246
So we have three campaigns
that are currently running.


446
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:24,726
And within each of
the campaigns,


447
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:26,536
you see four key metrics.


448
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:29,676
The total amount you spent
so far on this campaign


449
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:31,206
and you can see how
that compares


450
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:32,266
to the budget that you set.


451
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:35,806
The average CPA, again, that
was cost-per-acquisition,


452
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:37,416
how much you're paying
on average


453
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,636
for each additional download?


454
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:41,306
You can compare that to the
goal that you set as well.


455
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,796
Average CPC, the actual cost,


456
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,786
you're paying per-click
on your ad.


457
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:50,736
And if you would set a CPC
bid, you would see it here


458
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,976
so you could do a
comparison as well.


459
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:54,306
And finally, probably the
metric you guys care most


460
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,776
about the total number of
downloads that have resulted


461
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,776
from your ad campaign.


462
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:01,686
So from the Dashboard,
you can quickly drill in.


463
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:04,456
Let's take a look at
this campaign and see


464
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:06,936
and get a refresher of what
exactly this campaign is


465
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:07,346
all about.


466
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:10,636
So for this campaign,
we have multiple lines.


467
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:12,376
So we haven't talked
about lines yet.


468
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:15,226
Basically a line is a
set of targeting options.


469
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:19,226
Madhu went over that various
targeting options, gender, age,


470
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:20,706
user preference et cetera.


471
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:23,286
What you can do is you can
group those options together


472
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:24,396
into a single line.


473
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:28,946
You could call it, "Men 18 -
24" or some other combination.


474
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:32,546
And for each line, you can
set an independent budget,


475
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,696
independent daily spend goal,
and an independent CPA goal


476
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:40,766
so you can track how one line
is doing against another to see,


477
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,216
what is your target market?


478
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:47,276
And you can quickly flip
through multiple lines


479
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:49,176
to see all the different
settings that you have.


480
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,506
So we have "Men 35
- 49", "Men 50+".


481
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:54,416
So right now, we're
breaking it down based


482
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,096
on gender and age range.


483
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,826
In addition, you can
see all of the banners


484
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:01,436
that you have associated
with your campaign.


485
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,396
We have multiple banners


486
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,406
and using multiple
different templates to see


487
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:06,586
which one performs the best.


488
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,676
And you can see there's a number
up at the top, eight lines.


489
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:12,596
Basically for each of the
banners you can choose


490
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:14,466
which lines you want
to associate them with.


491
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:15,916
You may have certain banners


492
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,086
that may appeal a certain
demographics and certain banners


493
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,496
that may appeal to
different demographics,


494
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:22,166
this way you have the
ability to pick and choose


495
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:24,056
which banners will
show up to which lines.


496
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:29,146
OK. So now we've gotten familiar
with how this campaign is going.


497
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:31,606
Let's go back to the
Dashboard and take a look


498
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:32,376
at how it's performing.


499
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:35,026
We click on Home button and
go back to the Dashboard.


500
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:38,096
We are looking at
this Klara campaign.


501
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:42,836
Let's drill into spend and
see how we're doing on spend.


502
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:44,596
So when you come to
the analytics page,


503
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:47,646
one of the first things you
should do is choose what time


504
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:48,676
range you wish to look at.


505
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:51,316
By default we start with
today but there's option


506
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:54,916
for yesterday, the last 7 days,
the last 30 days, et cetera.


507
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,006
Let's go with last 30 days.


508
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,256
Up at the top, you actually see
the numbers for your campaign,


509
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:01,776
the full lifetime
of your campaign.


510
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,996
So you always have
that at your fingertips


511
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:06,246
so you can compare not
only how you're doing based


512
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:07,526
on the time range
that you've chosen


513
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,716
but the overall life
of the campaign.


514
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:13,516
So now that we've chosen last
30 days, we can see in the graph


515
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:15,076
and you can see how
much is being spent


516
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:16,456
across those 30 days.


517
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:18,676
You can choose to graph
a different metric,


518
00:25:18,946 --> 00:25:20,016
impressions, taps.


519
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:21,676
Let's stick with
the average CPA.


520
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:25,616
So you can see overall average
CPA is performing pretty well


521
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:28,036
and then you can overlay a
second metric on top of it


522
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:30,336
so you can vary to see
how the spend is doing


523
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:32,376
as compared to your average CPA.


524
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:36,016
In addition to the overlays,
you can actually click up here,


525
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:38,716
compare with the previous
period to see how your spend--


526
00:25:38,716 --> 00:25:41,856
or your average CPA is doing
over the previous 30 days


527
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:43,546
or the-- versus the
current 30 days.


528
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:49,926
And finally, you can also click
on a tabular view and see all


529
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:51,796
of the detailed information
about each


530
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:52,966
of the metrics all at once.


531
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,046
And if you would like you
can download a CSV file


532
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:58,796
so you can import it into
numbers or into Excel and slice


533
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:00,446
and dice it as you wish.


534
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:08,096
OK, so now from here this
was all about the campaign


535
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:11,116
but we can also drill in
to see the individual lines


536
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:11,736
as I discussed.


537
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:15,056
When you click on Lines Tab, you
see all of the different lines


538
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:16,696
and how they're comparing
against each other.


539
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:20,026
You can choose a metric, we can
do it base on average CPA again


540
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:25,276
and see that "Men 18 - 24" has
higher CPA than "Men 25 - 34".


541
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:28,726
Right now we graph three lines.


542
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,096
You can choose which
lines you want.


543
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:33,786
You can unselect 25 - 34
and select "Women 25 -


544
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:35,226
34" and see how that's doing.


545
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,256
And then quickly the graph--


546
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:39,956
,oh, it looks like
that one has no spend.


547
00:26:40,156 --> 00:26:43,356
OK, "Women 35 - 49", so you can
see how those three lines are


548
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:44,086
comparing to each other.


549
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:48,546
And then we have a similar
view on the banner side


550
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:50,676
so you can compare how banners
are doing against each other.


551
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:54,576
For this campaign, we actually
only have one banner that's


552
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,726
currently active so you
actually only see one banner.


553
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,136
You could-- If you don't
remember what Marigold Promo


554
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:02,536
actually relates to,
you can click on I icon


555
00:27:02,856 --> 00:27:06,416
and get a refresher of
exactly what this banner is.


556
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:10,406
OK, let's go back to lines and
see what optimizations we can do


557
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:12,516
against lines to improve
our campaign's performance.


558
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:17,246
OK, let's look at the overall
lifetime of the campaign.


559
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:22,456
So at the bottom of the--
at the bottom of the screen,


560
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:24,716
you see a table which basically
has all the different--


561
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,936
all the different
metrics that we have.


562
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,926
We want to optimize
based on the average CPA.


563
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:32,436
We can sort by average CPA which
again is how much you're paying


564
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:33,916
on average for additional
download.


565
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:36,726
And we see that these two
lines, the average CPA,


566
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:39,396
a dollar sixty-eight and a
dollar eighty-four is much less


567
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:40,636
than the 3 dollars
that we inputted.


568
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,986
So those two lines seem to
be performing pretty well.


569
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:44,896
And as you can see,
the downloads


570
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,326
for those two lines seem to
be the best out of those two--


571
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:48,816
out of all the lines
that we have.


572
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,656
So not only are you getting more
downloads you're actually paying


573
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:54,226
less for each download, this
seems like a good combination.


574
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:58,736
So it would make sense for us
to actually add additional spend


575
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:01,536
to these two lines perhaps
taking it away from the spend


576
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,616
from some of the lines that
are not performing as well.


577
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:07,486
And so this is the
power that you have


578
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:08,816
when you're doing
manual targeting.


579
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:11,026
But the beauty of
Auto is that this--


580
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:13,706
these optimizations are
automatically done by iAd.


581
00:28:13,956 --> 00:28:17,946
We automatically figure out
which demographics are the ones


582
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,576
that are performing best for
you giving you maximum downloads


583
00:28:20,696 --> 00:28:21,476
and lowest CPA.


584
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:23,266
Back to you Madhu.


585
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,056
>> All right.


586
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:25,966
Thank you Vineet.


587
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:30,126
So we saw how you can
manage your performance.


588
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,536
Once you have setup
your campaigns,


589
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:33,756
you can go into the tool


590
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:36,206
and manage the performance
of those campaigns.


591
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,876
So iAd Workbench as I
mentioned is available now.


592
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,806
We launched it yesterday
and many


593
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,486
of you already started using it.


594
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,226
But what else could we do?


595
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:53,006
So coming in the Fall, we
have iAd Workbench for iOS.


596
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:56,526
So we have it on
the iPhone and iPad.


597
00:28:57,146 --> 00:29:00,936
Many of you perhaps use
iTunes Connect Mobile


598
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:03,896
for managing your apps on
the go in the App Store.


599
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:08,946
Now the same app with the
additional iAd tab can be used


600
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:11,906
to manage your campaigns
on the go.


601
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,456
So what are the key
features here?


602
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:17,276
You have access to
actionable information.


603
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:20,636
So the same dashboard and
drill downs that we saw


604
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:24,926
on the web application are also
available on the iOS devices.


605
00:29:25,486 --> 00:29:27,306
But they are customized
obviously for touch.


606
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:30,386
And you will see Mike
giving us a demo of that.


607
00:29:30,906 --> 00:29:32,966
We also have alerts
and notifications


608
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:34,466
which is really important--


609
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:36,686
which are really important
in the mobile context.


610
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:40,706
We will tell you what's
going on with your account


611
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,836
or with your campaign on the
go so you can take action.


612
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,436
The action can be updating
dates, so if you want


613
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:50,016
to extend your campaign
or extend your budgets,


614
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:52,916
change your bid based on the
alerts that you might get


615
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:56,656
or based on the performance
you might want to pause


616
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:59,666
or unpause any of the
campaigns, lines or banners


617
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:00,666
that you have running.


618
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,846
So all of the functionality that
you see on the web for managing


619
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:09,686
and optimizing your campaigns is
also available for you on iOS.


620
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:15,836
So its coming this Fall but
Mike can do a demo for us now.


621
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:16,736
Mike?


622
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:17,576
>> Thank you.


623
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:20,016
So this is the iTunes
Connect Mobile application


624
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:22,296
and I'm sure a lot of
you are familiar with.


625
00:30:22,296 --> 00:30:25,426
Let's fire it up.


626
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:27,946
And we'll sign in
with our Apple ID.


627
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:32,406
And the first thing you'll
notice that on the bottom,


628
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:35,116
there's now iAd tab that
wasn't there before.


629
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,686
And this is the campaign
Dashboard page.


630
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,546
It shows all the
campaigns that we have.


631
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:43,866
You can see some brief info
about them, their name,


632
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:46,056
their status, their
flight dates.


633
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:50,336
You can sort them by running,
not running, or completed.


634
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,636
Let's have a look at the
first campaign here BB iPad1.


635
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:55,366
We'll tap that.


636
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:59,326
These are the campaign
detail page.


637
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,976
At the top you will see-- again,
see some basic information


638
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:05,946
about this campaign, the name,
the flight dates, the status.


639
00:31:06,836 --> 00:31:09,686
Down the bottom you'll see all
your campaign results to date.


640
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,526
So you will your spend in
relation to your budget,


641
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:15,926
your average CPC,
your average CPA


642
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:18,356
and your CPA goal and downloads.


643
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:22,186
And if you wanted to see how
these metrics accrued over time,


644
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,786
you can swipe the
table to the left


645
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:26,886
and you see a beautiful
graph of the data.


646
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:36,106
So this is for spend, average
CPC, average CPA and downloads.


647
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:39,276
By default, it's showing
the last 24 hour period.


648
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:45,756
You can also change the time
period for seven days, 30 days


649
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:50,076
or for the lifetime
of your campaign.


650
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:51,736
If you want to see the graph


651
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:56,596
in more detail you can rotate
your device to landscape


652
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,126
and see the graph
in full screen.


653
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,536
All the same graphs
that were available


654
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:04,506
in portrait are available
in landscape.


655
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,316
If you just want to jump to
a specific graph and not want


656
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:10,716
to have to swipe through to
find it, you can just tap


657
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:12,306
that metric in the table view.


658
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:16,406
So if we want to jump quickly to
spend, we can just tap on that


659
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:18,106
and look at the spend graph.


660
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,966
Let's switch back to portrait.


661
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:25,816
In the middle of the screen
you'll notice two buttons,


662
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,226
one for line items
and one for banners.


663
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:30,996
Use for the line items
associated worth this campaign


664
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:31,846
and for the banners.


665
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:33,596
Let's look at the line items.


666
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,296
This shows the three line items


667
00:32:36,296 --> 00:32:37,856
that I have associated
with this campaign.


668
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:42,246
You'll see the name, the flight
dates, the status and the spent


669
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:43,216
in relation to the budget.


670
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:44,976
Let's tap into the first one.


671
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,616
This shows the line
detail screen, very similar


672
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:52,016
to the campaign detail screen.


673
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:54,116
We will see some basic
information at the top


674
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:56,976
about the status, the flight
dates and you will the results


675
00:32:57,046 --> 00:32:58,006
to date down the bottom.


676
00:32:58,006 --> 00:33:00,616
You will be able to see the
spend in relation to the budget,


677
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:03,996
the average CPC,
CPA and downloads.


678
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:07,726
And of course you can swipe
them to get the graphs.


679
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:13,966
In the middle section
there's a button for banners.


680
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,406
This will show us all the
banners we have associated


681
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:17,686
with this particular campaign.


682
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:19,416
So let's tap that
and have a look.


683
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:23,296
There're two banners
associated with this campaign


684
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:26,666
and its showing us the
spend on both of those.


685
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,646
Let's tap and look
at the first one.


686
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:31,926
This is the banner
detail very similar


687
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,986
to the campaign detail
and line detail.


688
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:36,186
We're going to have some basic
information about the banner


689
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:39,236
at the top, its status, and
down the bottom you'll have the


690
00:33:39,236 --> 00:33:40,626
banner results to date.


691
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,576
And again, you can
swipe over and look


692
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:47,646
at the graphs for
the various data.


693
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:51,776
Now you notice in the top
right corner there there's a


694
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:52,396
Pause button.


695
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:53,696
You'll be able to pause


696
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:56,116
and restart your banner
directly from your device.


697
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:57,696
So let's pause this banner.


698
00:33:58,816 --> 00:34:00,406
It'll ask us if we
want to continue.


699
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:02,996
Yes. And now the
banner is paused.


700
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:06,076
If we want to restart the
banner, we can just tap Restart


701
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:09,315
and continue and the
banner is now restarted.


702
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:12,525
Let's go back to the
campaign Dashboard page


703
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:14,466
by tapping the tab
at the bottom.


704
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:18,886
And you may have noticed at the
top it's telling us that one


705
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:20,646
of our campaigns
may need attention.


706
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:22,596
And the second campaign,


707
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:25,646
Prod Pack Promo has an
Alert icon next to it,


708
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:28,216
signifying that that is the
campaign that has a problem.


709
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:33,116
So let's tap that
and have a look.


710
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:34,866
You'll notice on
the lines button,


711
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:37,466
there's another alert
button, another alert icon.


712
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,315
So it's telling us that one of
our line items has a problem.


713
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:42,795
So, let's tap it
and check it out.


714
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:46,856
We have eight line items
associated with this campaign


715
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,496
and you'll notice that two
of them have the alert icon,


716
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:52,466
so two of the lines
have a problem.


717
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,216
Let's look at the second one.


718
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:57,666
And there we go.


719
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,906
At the top, it's telling us
exactly what the problem is.


720
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:02,066
It's saying a bid amount
may not be sufficient


721
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:03,556
to reach our campaign goal.


722
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:06,296
So that definitely seems
like something we should fix.


723
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:08,646
So on the top right corner


724
00:35:08,646 --> 00:35:10,586
of the screen you'll
notice an Edit button.


725
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,036
Let's tap that and
edit this line item.


726
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:17,276
So this is the line item editor.


727
00:35:17,966 --> 00:35:22,006
In here, you can change
the end date, the budget,


728
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,966
your max daily spend
and you CPA goal.


729
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:27,486
And you notice down the bottom,
you can also pause the line


730
00:35:27,486 --> 00:35:29,976
or restart the line much
like you can with banners.


731
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:32,966
So, you can also see
down at the bottom


732
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,916
on the CPA goal line
there's the alert icon.


733
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,446
That letting us know that
that is a particular line


734
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:39,666
that we need to change.


735
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:42,506
So, let's tap on
that to edit it.


736
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:45,846
This will bring up
a standard keypad


737
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:48,246
but we've added two custom
buttons in there for you,


738
00:35:48,636 --> 00:35:50,626
a plus 5 percent and
a minus 5 percent


739
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:54,126
so you can quickly change your
value by 5 percent increments.


740
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:55,816
So let's add 5 percent.


741
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:58,696
Nah, let's bump it
up another 5 percent.


742
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:02,286
When you're satisfied with
all the values and you want


743
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:05,316
to save it, just
touch the Done button


744
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,716
and the values are now saved.


745
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:11,386
So these are just some of the
features that will be available


746
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:14,796
in new iAd module within
iTunes Connect Mobile coming


747
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:22,376

749
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:24,926
>> Thank you Mike.


750
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,116
So it's coming in the fall.


751
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:30,806
But iAd Workbench is already
available and thousands


752

So get started with
iAd Workbench.


754
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,046
It's cool, huh?

758
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:49,926
