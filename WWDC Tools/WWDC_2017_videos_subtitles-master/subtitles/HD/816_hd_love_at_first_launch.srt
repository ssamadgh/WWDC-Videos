1
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,606
All right, imagine you're

2
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:23,566
searching for an apartment.

3
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:25,606
You've been in the hunt, and

4
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:26,636
this one looks pretty good.

5
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:29,076
The price is right.

6
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,716
Photos show tons of natural

7
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:31,876
light, it's close to work.

8
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:34,176
So you schedule some time to

9
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:36,025
stop by and check the place out.

10
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:37,786
You bike over.

11
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:38,906
Someone buzzes you in.

12
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:40,066
You find the apartment door.

13
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:41,586
You give it a knock.

14
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,816
And the landlord greets you.

15
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,996
And before he'll even let you

16
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:48,936
pass the front door, he has some

17
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:49,666
requirements.

18
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,746
He wants to see a passport, a

19
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,466
birth certificate, and your last

20
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:54,416
four paystubs.

21
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:55,646
Now this would be a little

22
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:56,386
ridiculous, right?

23
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:58,116
You just want to check the place

24
00:00:58,116 --> 00:00:59,266
out, you're not ready to commit

25
00:00:59,266 --> 00:00:59,936
to anything yet.

26
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:01,786
Plus, who knows if your private

27
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:03,526
info is safe with this guy.

28
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,096
First impressions matter.

29
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:09,396
They matter because they could

30
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:10,276
also be your last.

31
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,346
People have access to millions

32
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:13,396
of apps in the App Store.

33
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:15,346
You've already passed the first

34
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:16,686
hurdle when someone installs

35
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:17,036
your app.

36
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:17,786
Great.

37
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:21,826
So prevent them from backing out

38
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,316
and deleting your app in the

39
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,616
same way you'd probably be off

40
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:25,656
to the next apartment on your

41
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:25,976
list.

42
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:27,956
And instead, start things off

43
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:29,256
with a great first impression.

44
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:34,156
Now suppose you're planning a

45
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:34,516
trip.

46
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:35,956
And a friend suggested this

47
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:37,026
travel app here.

48
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:39,096
Looks pretty good.

49
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:41,156
So the installation completes.

50
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:42,936
You tap open for the first time.

51
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:45,376
And you're met with this.

52
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:47,946
Now, does this look familiar?

53
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,146
Someone wants you to register

54
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:51,416
here, but there's not much info

55
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,016
about what this app actually

56
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:53,426
does.

57
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:55,986
Sure, you have some idea after

58
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:57,186
your friend's recommendation.

59
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:58,786
But when you open the app for

60
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,836
the first time and this is how

61
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:02,666
you're greeted, it still feels a

62
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,626
little something like this guy.

63
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:08,716
There's a chance you might back

64
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,166
out, delete it, and go find

65
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:10,746
something else.

66
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:15,806
Now consider this military base

67
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:18,306
with its fortified exterior, the

68
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,616
message to anyone on the outside

69
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,126
is clear, stay out, right?

70
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:23,656
Compare that to Apple Union

71
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,036
Square in San Francisco.

72
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:26,776
The entire front of the store

73
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:28,026
opens up to the sidewalk,

74
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:30,176
inviting passersby to wander in.

75
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,356
And wander in is exactly what

76
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:32,776
they do.

77
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:35,016
As people use -- as people

78
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,406
explore the store, they're able

79
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,736
to pick up and use iPhones.

80
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:39,556
They might take a new Mac for a

81
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:40,876
test drive or try on an Apple

82
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:43,136
Watch, all without obstacles or

83
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:43,646
friction.

84
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:46,486
Your first launch experience

85
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:47,236
should feel just as

86
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:47,876
frictionless.

87
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:49,616
If people are greeted with an

88
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,816
open, interactive experience the

89
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,076
very first time they tap your

90
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,586
icon, you're going to make a

91
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:56,086
great first impression and keep

92
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:56,656
them coming back.

93
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:58,546
So let's talk about some ways to

94
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,156
make that happen.

95
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:02,856
We'll be discussing some tips

96
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:04,496
for leading with content first.

97
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,226
How to teach new users about

98
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:08,636
your app through interaction.

99
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,506
And when you need to ask for

100
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:12,746
some more information up front,

101
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:16,026
some tips on timing that will

102
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,476
add to a great user experience.

103
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:19,726
So let's start with some

104
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:21,146
strategies for content first

105
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:21,586
approach.

106
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:25,146
Let's compare our travel app

107
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,276
here to another travel app.

108
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,216
This is Jetsetter.

109
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:31,296
The very first time you open

110
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,556
Jetsetter, you're immediately

111
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:34,256
greeted with this great content.

112
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,776
Big, beautiful images, useful

113
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:37,466
information.

114
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,356
You can browse this feed, of

115
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:40,526
course, or you can jump right

116
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:41,396
into search if you have

117
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:42,516
something specific in mind.

118
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,946
If a destination catches your

119
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,376
attention, you can drill in for

120
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,136
more photos and more details.

121
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,216
And it's been seconds since you

122
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,125
first launched this app, and

123
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,156
you're already using it like a

124
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:54,466
pro.

125
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,176
You're intrigued by all this

126
00:03:56,176 --> 00:03:57,846
great content and you've already

127
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,046
started daydreaming about laying

128
00:03:59,046 --> 00:03:59,806
on this beach.

129
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:01,706
It's only when you're ready to

130
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:03,446
book the trip that you're

131
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:04,476
prompted to register.

132
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:06,796
By now, you've got a good idea

133
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,086
of what the app has to offer.

134
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:09,286
You've seen the potential

135
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,266
benefits of registering, so this

136
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,596
feels like a more appropriate

137
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:13,976
time to share more details.

138
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,176
If you're not convinced yet,

139
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,526
just compare Jetsetter with our

140
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,956
other travel app.

141
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,026
Now, we've all been through some

142
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:25,226
version of that top row.

143
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:26,466
Which one of these feels more

144
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,256
welcoming to you?

145
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,766
Always lead with great content.

146
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,456
Show off what makes your app

147
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,466
great right off the bat, and let

148
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,126
people dig in.

149
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,116
Now there are some situations

150
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:42,156
where a little bit of upfront

151
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,586
instruction might be helpful.

152
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:46,486
And I say might because before

153
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,506
you start incorporating some of

154
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,686
the tips we're about to look at,

155
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,176
I want you to very carefully

156
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,576
consider whether any upfront

157
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:52,736
instruction is needed at all.

158
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:54,986
Let's take a quick look at the

159
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:55,446
phone app.

160
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,886
Now, just imagine if we designed

161
00:04:58,886 --> 00:05:00,326
this with a series of first-run

162
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:00,936
tool tips.

163
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:03,856
It'd be a little ridiculous,

164
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:04,076
right?

165
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,956
This interface is obvious.

166
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:08,366
We know how it works.

167
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:10,706
You should strive to design your

168
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:12,186
interfaces to be as intuitive

169
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,676
and as easy to understand as

170
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:14,216
possible.

171
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:16,516
Ideally, no upfront instruction

172
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,216
is needed at all.

173
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:20,706
All right, let's take a look at

174
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:21,796
Lara Croft GO.

175
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:23,936
This is your starting point

176
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:24,156
here.

177
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:26,636
No onboarding, no instructions,

178
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:28,556
nothing to pull your attention

179
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:30,146
from this immersive experience.

180
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,216
You're right in the game.

181
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,336
But you still need to learn how

182
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,696
to play this game, so these

183
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,096
first few levels are designed to

184
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,366
introduce you to the basics.

185
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,416
Well, you only have a straight

186
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,266
line here, and Lara looks like

187
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,026
she's ready to go.

188
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:44,806
Since there are no visible

189
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:46,616
controls, you try swiping on the

190
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:47,066
screen.

191
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:49,456
And sure enough, she starts

192
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:50,466
moving in the direction you've

193
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:50,906
gestured.

194
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:55,196
You quickly discover you can

195
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,356
move up and down walls too.

196
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,696
And congratulations, you've

197
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,036
learned the game's navigation

198
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:00,626
controls.

199
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:03,946
All right, now you've got this

200
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,066
glowing tile of a head catching

201
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:05,666
your attention.

202
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,096
Options look pretty limited, so

203
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,476
let's go check it out.

204
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,556
Yes, you've just completed a

205
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:16,006
level.

206
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:21,126
Now, that one was pretty simple,

207
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:21,726
of course.

208
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:26,536
But it's teaching you the

209
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,406
basics, and you're already

210
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:29,196
playing the game.

211
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,206
All right, level two starts

212
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:33,416
here.

213
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:35,286
Looks like your path is cut

214
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:37,046
short, so let's try that switch.

215
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,386
Aha, the missing path fills in,

216
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:47,056
and you figured out another

217
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:48,366
important part about how this

218
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:48,986
game works.

219
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,446
Now, of course, things get a lot

220
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,396
more complex from here.

221
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,046
But you can start to see how

222
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,756
instruction can be layered into

223
00:06:57,756 --> 00:06:58,586
an experience.

224
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:00,706
And again, no onboarding, no

225
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,296
tool tips or floating hands

226
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:02,506
here.

227
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,116
There are no barriers when you

228
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:05,446
first play Lara Croft GO.

229
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,316
And this approach works in all

230
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,716
kinds of apps, not just games.

231
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:11,936
This is streaks.

232
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:13,636
It's a simple app designed to

233
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:14,836
help you pick up new habits.

234
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,156
In my case as you might be able

235
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:18,646
to guess, I'm studying French,

236
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,016
and I'm trying to make a habit

237
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:20,896
of practicing every day.

238
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:22,286
Maybe Streaks can help.

239
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,116
The completion of a task is

240
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,506
represented by the filling in of

241
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:26,886
a ring.

242
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,456
So the first launch experience

243
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:31,156
conveys this in a clever way by

244
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:32,526
inviting you to fill in rings as

245
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:33,356
you proceed through this

246
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:33,896
introduction.

247
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,996
And you're led right into

248
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:39,106
creating your first habit.

249
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:41,646
So if your app requires a bit of

250
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:43,306
upfront education, it's going to

251
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:44,516
be a lot more compelling if it's

252
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,376
interactive and gives people

253
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:48,416
that sense of jumping right in.

254
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:52,326
Teach through interactive

255
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:53,166
experiences.

256
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:56,956
Now, another place you don't

257
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,126
want people to get stuck is with

258
00:07:58,226 --> 00:07:59,216
permission requests.

259
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,116
You know what it's like to open

260
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,256
an app for the first time and

261
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:03,356
get hit with permission requests

262
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,086
after permission requests, sort

263
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,275
of like that demanding landlord

264
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:06,926
we met earlier.

265
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:08,496
So let's look at some tips for

266
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:09,126
getting this right.

267
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:12,405
This is Strava.

268
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,285
Strava lets you use your iPhone

269
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:16,986
to track outdoor runs and bike

270
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:19,416
rides, and it eventually asks

271
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,936
for access to your location,

272
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:23,416
your camera, your contacts, even

273
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,066
health get data.

274
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:26,166
But it doesn't ask for all of

275
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:26,816
these right away.

276
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,276
Instead, Strava makes requests

277
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,626
on an as-needed basis.

278
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,876
For example, it's not until

279
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:34,946
you're ready to take Strava out

280
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,186
for a ride for the first time

281
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:37,636
that you're prompted to share

282
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:38,276
your location.

283
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,876
So you hit record down at the

284
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:41,516
bottom.

285
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:42,596
We'll get you on a ride here.

286
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:44,346
Who's ready to roll?

287
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:49,176
All right, so you're going on

288
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:49,686
your ride.

289
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:51,626
And eventually, a little while

290
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,056
later, you're ready to wrap

291
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:53,746
things up.

292
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:54,736
We'll make it a short ride.

293
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,936
So you stop the ride, and you

294
00:08:57,936 --> 00:08:58,586
tap save.

295
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:01,176
Now, when you're saving a ride,

296
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:02,566
you have the option to add more

297
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,976
details, including a photo.

298
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:09,946
It's only when you tap add a

299
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:11,626
photo that you're prompted for

300
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,056
access to your photo library.

301
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:15,646
And this is another great

302
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:17,496
example of a permission request

303
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,846
that's right in context.

304
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:20,376
So you immediately see the

305
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:21,896
benefit and no additional

306
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,116
explanation is necessary.

307
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,666
And then it's the same situation

308
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,596
when looking for friends on

309
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,076
Strava in your contacts.

310
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:32,816
The app requests permissions on

311
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:33,896
a need-to-know basis.

312
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:35,966
So you retain a sense of control

313
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,796
over both the experience and

314
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:38,596
your private data.

315
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,586
Now, there are a few apps out

316
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:45,196
there that can't offer any value

317
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,106
without some sort of

318
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:46,706
permissions.

319
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:48,506
This is Transit.

320
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,466
It lists departures of nearby

321
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,376
buses and trains, order based on

322
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:53,416
proximity to your current

323
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:53,906
location.

324
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,046
I live in San Francisco, and I

325
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:57,476
use this one all the time to get

326
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:57,796
around.

327
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:00,856
Of course, it wouldn't be able

328
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:02,406
to provide this data without

329
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:04,386
your location, so the first time

330
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:06,546
you launch the app, you are

331
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,936
prompted to share your location.

332
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,636
And as soon as you tap allow,

333
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:12,296
the map zooms in, and you're

334
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,706
presented with a list of nearby

335
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,016
routes and departure times.

336
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:17,376
So you immediately see the value

337
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:19,076
Transit will provide in exchange

338
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,096
for this information.

339
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:26,426
So remember, I'm sure people

340
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,156
understand the value of sharing

341
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:29,226
their private data with you,

342
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,366
ideally before you ask for it.

343
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,406
Once that permission has been

344
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:35,536
granted, reinforce the decision

345
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,906
by showing off the benefits

346
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:38,416
you'll provide with that data.

347
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,616
Only ask for what's needed when

348
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:41,106
it's needed.

349
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,136
Follow these tips, and I promise

350
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:45,886
you'll make a great first

351
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:46,356
impression.

352
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,136
Thank you.
