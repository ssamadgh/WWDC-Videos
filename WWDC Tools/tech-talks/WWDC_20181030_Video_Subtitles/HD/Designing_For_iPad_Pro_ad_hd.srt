00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,770
Mike Stern: The new iPad Pro
features an all-screen design


2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,373
so people can focus
on what matters most:


3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,543
immersing themselves
in your app or game.


4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,478
And the second generation
Apple Pencil


5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,513
includes
a new double-tap feature


6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,184
that makes it even more capable
and convenient.


7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,820
Let's talk about
how to update your app's design


8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,624
to take advantage
of these new features.


9
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,792
The 11-inch iPad Pro display


10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:32,332
is 1,194 by 834 points
at 2x resolution.


11
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,835
The 12.9-inch iPad Pro's display


12
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:41,675
is 1,366 by 1,024 points
at 2x resolution.


13
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:46,380
In pixels, that's 2,388 by 1,668


14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,084
and 2,732 by 2,048.


15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,554
The 12.9-inch display
is the same width and height


16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,490
as the previous generation.


17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,492
The 11-inch iPad Pro display


18
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,728
has the same height
as a 10.5-inch iPad Pro,


19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:07,100
while being 82 points,
or 164 pixels, wider.


20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,070
The new iPad Pros
feature a thin bezel


21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,638
and rounded corners.


22
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,341
As with current generation
iPhone displays,


23
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,377
avoid placing
critical information or controls


24
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,781
into the extreme corners
of your interface.


25
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:25,085
For many apps, the status bar
and UIKit navigation bar,


26
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,020
toolbar, and tab bar


27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,757
will automatically
inset elements correctly.


28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,493
And, as with iPhone,
a Home indicator


29
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,362
lets people know
they can swipe up


30
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:39,132
to return to the Home screen
and switch apps.


31
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,269
To make sure your app or game
looks great on iPad Pro,


32
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,805
you'll want to follow
three best practices


33
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,374
when laying out your interface.


34
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,010
First, use safe area
layout guides


35
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,746
to prevent interface elements
from getting clipped


36
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,881
by the display's
rounded corners,


37
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,883
or covered
by the Home indicator.


38
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,385
Safe areas are determined


39
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,888
by insets from each edge
of the screen.


40
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,992
With nothing on screen,
all insets are zero,


41
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,660
except for the bottom.


42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,762
The bottom safe area inset
keeps elements


43
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,365
from getting covered
by the Home indicator.


44
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,002
The inset is 20 points
in portrait orientation


45
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,504
and in landscape.


46
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,007
While it may be tempting
to put UI elements


47
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,009
on either side
of the Home indicator,


48
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,543
it's not recommended.


49
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,879
The Home indicator
is centered in the display.


50
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,217
In a split view, its position
relative to your app will change


51
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,286
and may cover
interface elements.


52
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,888
When a status bar is displayed,


53
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,657
the top inset value
is 24 points.


54
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,762
That's slightly taller than
the 20-point top inset on iPhone


55
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,664
and previous generation iPads.


56
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,034
A quick but important side note.


57
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,870
Apps running in Slide Over
will have zero height


58
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,973
top and bottom
safe area insets.


59
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,276
The safe area is further inset
to accommodate


60
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,747
a navigation bar
and tab bar or toolbar.


61
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,215
In both orientations,


62
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,385
the left and right
safe area insets are zero.


63
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,522
That's different from iPhone,
where left and right insets


64
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,290
keep elements
from getting covered


65
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,126
by the device's sensor housing.


66
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,363
Next, use layout margins
to inset content


67
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,566
from the left and right
screen edges.


68
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,270
Layout margins provide
breathing space between content


69
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,106
and the display's
left and right edges.


70
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,741
They're great
for aligning content


71
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,509
to elements
in the navigation bar,


72
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,513
toolbar, and status bar,
and they keep content


73
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,750
from scrolling into
the display's rounded corners.


74
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,987
The width of layout margins
varies based on size class.


75
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:46,693
They are 20 points for regular
and 16 points for compact.


76
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,229
Finally, be ready
to accommodate


77
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,631
multiple aspect ratios.


78
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,435
All previous iPads
had a 4:3 aspect ratio.


79
00:03:55,435 --> 00:04:00,373
The new 11-inch iPad Pro
has a wider aspect ratio.


80
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,242
If your app
is designed and built


81
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,878
for a 4:3 aspect ratio only,


82
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,347
you'll need to allow
for more flexibility


83
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,382
in your design and code.


84
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:14,221
For example, a game that's only
designed for a 4:3 aspect ratio


85
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,690
may wind up having black bars
along the smaller screen edges


86
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,026
if it's scaled
to fit the display.


87
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,229
If the game were scaled
to fill the display,


88
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,198
parts of the UI
could wind up off screen.


89
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,368
So take care to thoughtfully
position and scale


90
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,137
individual interface elements


91
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,772
so that your app and game
looks great,


92
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:37,077
regardless of the display's
aspect ratio.


93
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,813
Alongside our latest
generation iPad Pro,


94
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,517
we're introducing a new,
more powerful Apple Pencil.


95
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,686
The new Pencil has
all the same capabilities


96
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,788
as the previous generation.


97
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,259
This includes the ability
to use pressure, or force,


98
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,096
to control things like
brush opacity and size,


99
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,900
and the ability to sense
altitude and azimuth,


100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,769
two properties that,
when combined with each other,


101
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,305
deliver a fantastic
tilt experience


102
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,275
for expressive
and realistic shading.


103
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,711
The new Apple Pencil
adds a double-tap gesture.


104
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,014
In the Settings app,
people can choose


105
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,783
one of four behaviors
for double-tap.


106
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,518
These system-wide behaviors


107
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,055
offer people a consistent
and predictable experience.


108
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,590
People can switch between


109
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,893
the currently selected
tool and eraser,


110
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,397
switch between the
current tool and last used tool,


111
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,566
show a color palette,


112
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:39,172
or if they prefer,
turn the double-tap gesture off.


113
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,007
Because every
app is unique,


114
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,510
you'll need to give some thought
to what double-tap does


115
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,678
in your app.


116
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,379
To help you make the right call,


117
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,249
please consider
the following best practices,


118
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,751
starting with the most basic.


119
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,554
If a person has turned
double-tap off


120
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,022
at the system level,


121
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,960
your app should do nothing
in response to double-tap.


122
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,663
If someone using your app
has turned double-tap off,


123
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:07,300
they'll expect every app
to respect that choice.


124
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,037
More generally, your app
should follow the system setting


125
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,440
whenever possible.


126
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,076
Apple Pencil
is a mark-making tool


127
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,411
and the system settings
reflect that.


128
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,780
If your app
has multiple drawing tools,


129
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,018
an eraser, and color palette,
people will expect your app


130
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:28,622
to mirror whatever choice
they've made in Settings.


131
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:32,092
Being inconsistent will make
your app less intuitive,


132
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,427
especially when multitasking
with another app


133
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,630
that supports Apple Pencil.


134
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,866
If you decide to offer
another behavior for double-tap


135
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,968
beyond the choices shown here,


136
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,638
make that custom behavior
opt-in,


137
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:48,842
meaning it should be optional
and not enabled by default.


138
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,911
Display the option
to enable your custom behavior


139
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,481
within your app's settings.


140
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,615
This will require people


141
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,285
to make an explicit
and deliberate choice


142
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,388
to override
the system-level behavior.


143
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,057
It will make it more clear
why double-tapping Apple Pencil


144
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,093
leads to a different behavior
in your app.


145
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,730
And if they decide to turn off
your app's custom behavior,


146
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,466
they'll be more likely
to remember how.


147
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,903
Now, there are apps that work
great with Apple Pencil


148
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,173
but do not have multiple tools
or a color palette.


149
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,875
If that describes your app,


150
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,111
it won't be possible
to follow the system settings.


151
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,381
However, you can still
provide a double-tap behavior


152
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,551
that's consistent with
the spirit of these settings.


153
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,554
Meaning, double-tap should
modify the behavior


154
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,156
of Apple Pencil.


155
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:39,259
So, for example, a photo app
may include effects


156
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,896
with masks the user can
paint onto their images.


157
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,531
Double-tapping Apple Pencil


158
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,133
could toggle between
two painting modes:


159
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,371
Adding to or subtracting
from the effect mask.


160
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,239
What double-tapping
should not do


161
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,143
is perform an action
that directly modifies content.


162
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,379
An action performed
with double-tap


163
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,047
could be done accidentally


164
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,883
and cause significant
workflow issues.


165
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,153
Now, whatever double-tapping
does in your app,


166
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,257
always be sure to provide clear
and immediate visual feedback


167
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,760
about what double-tapping did.


168
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,562
It's important
that people realize


169
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,164
they've changed
the behavior of their pencil


170
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,167
before they resume
drawing or writing.


171
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,572
And, finally, be prepared
to deliver a great experience


172
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,974
to existing Pencil users.


173
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,410
More specifically,
double-tapping


174
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,812
shouldn't provide
special functionality


175
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,916
that isn't easily achievable
