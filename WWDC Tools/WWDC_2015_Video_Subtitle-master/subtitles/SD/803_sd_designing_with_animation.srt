00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,046
>> JULIAN MISSIG:
Hello, everyone.


3
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:43,046
I am Julian.


4
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,196
I brought along my
teammates, Joe and Marek.


5
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,496
Welcome to Designing
with Animation.


6
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:54,756
If you have an app or a
game, you've probably come


7
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:57,376
across the circumstance where
you want to tell someone


8
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:58,896
that something has happened.


9
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:01,656
Perhaps a new item is
added to this list.


10
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:06,206
You could do something
like this.


11
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,366
Or perhaps you would like people


12
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:14,586
to understand how two different
parts of your app are related.


13
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:18,636
You could do something
like this ...


14
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,986
Or maybe your app has a gesture
you've just introduced and you'd


15
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:27,156
like people to understand
how the gesture works.


16
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:31,296
You could do something
like this ...


17
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:35,296
Now, as you might suspect, given
the name of the talk today,


18
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,736
there is another way to do this.


19
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:42,506
Today we're going to talk
about how you can use animation


20
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:48,006
to direct people's attention,
keep people oriented,


21
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:52,806
and connect people's behavior
to what's happening on screen.


22
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:56,136
But before we get into that,


23
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,546
just a little bit
about who we are.


24
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:02,466
We're a team of inventors,
designers, and prototypers.


25
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:07,826
We explore what new interfaces
mean for Apple's products,


26
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:10,776
including trackpad
gestures, Force Touch,


27
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:14,226
and the Taptic Engine.


28
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,846
But we don't make full
working apps to do this.


29
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,396
We make little animated
experiments


30
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:24,756
and interactive prototypes.


31
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,276
Today we will talk a little
bit about what that means.


32
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:34,606
So the plan for today is to
ease in to the what, why,


33
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:38,826
and how of animation;
to communicate an idea


34
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:44,026
by animating it; and to learn a
little bit about how animation


35
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,216
and interaction are intertwined.


36
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,886
So what is animation?


37
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:58,886
How do we think about animation
when we are making our apps?


38
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:03,866
Well, at one point in time,
your app will have one screen,


39
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:09,006
and at some other point in time,
it will have some other screen.


40
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:13,926
Because these two apps don't
exist at the exact same time,


41
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,986
there is going to be some
kind of change between them,


42
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:19,816
even if it's just an
instantaneous pop.


43
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:22,706
It's this change that
we are talking about,


44
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:25,866
this change over time, when
we think about animation.


45
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:30,326
Now, because humans usually
can't perceive instantaneous


46
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,996
change unless you
are pretty special,


47
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:36,966
you can slowly change
things over time


48
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,696
to communicate something
about how things are related.


49
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:42,466
So animation is change
over time.


50
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:46,446
But you'll note that when I
was talking about this change


51
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:49,626
over time, I already
had those two screens.


52
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:52,196
Animation isn't going to solve
all of your design problems.


53
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:53,936
You still need to go
out there and figure


54
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,076
out which screens
your app should have


55
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,826
and what should be on them.


56
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:04,636
But the manner of this change


57
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:06,896
over time can communicate
things.


58
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,576
Chances are your app has
more than just two screens.


59
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,486
In fact, it may have many,
many different screens.


60
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:18,435
And you can use a different type
of animation for the transition


61
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:22,176
between different types of
screens to communicate something


62
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:24,216
about how all the screens
relate to one another.


63
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:31,346
So all this different change
over time communicates something


64
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,036
about how all of the screens
in your app fit together.


65
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,926
This is a very practical way
of thinking about animation.


66
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,396
It's solving some
of these problems.


67
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:42,896
But there's another
thing to pay attention


68
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:46,646
to when you are looking at the
manner of the change over time.


69
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:51,306
If we go back to that example
of adding a new item to a list,


70
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:54,486
you could animate a
new item in like this.


71
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:59,156
And this might be
appropriate for a game


72
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:02,266
if a new player has been added,
and this is a very rare event


73
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,636
and you want to kind
of celebrate it.


74
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:07,386
But for most apps, you
probably don't need to go


75
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:08,606
that far with your animation.


76
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:14,026
You might be more familiar with
an animation kind of like this.


77
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:16,996
The point is both of these
animations are communicating


78
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,936
that a new item has been
added, but they do it


79
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:20,786
in a different manner.


80
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,566
They communicate something
about your app's character.


81
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,776
It's an artful way of thinking
about this change over time


82
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:31,306
that tells you how
the app feels.


83
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:35,406
Especially as we start to look
at content front and center


84
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:40,206
in apps, the motion of this
content can be very powerful


85
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:48,546
in communicating what your
app is and how it feels.


86
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:50,216
So why should we animate?


87
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:55,306
When do we decide to start
looking at animations?


88
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:58,166
Well, there are probably a
lot of different reasons,


89
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,346
so today we are just going to
look at three main categories.


90
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:06,776
The first is to direct
people's attention.


91
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,766
To help them become
aware that something


92
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:14,016
within your app has changed.


93
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:18,396
Perhaps something behind the
scenes in your app has changed.


94
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,816
You want your users
to understand


95
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:22,306
that there's something
new that they can explore.


96
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:31,276
Or perhaps your user has
performed some type of action.


97
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,636
Maybe you are going
to press and hold


98
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:34,916
on these icons for a little bit.


99
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:40,586
This animation is communicating
the result of the user's action.


100
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:46,066
By pressing and holding, I've
changed the state of the app.


101
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,286
So directing attention
can be useful


102
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,466
for both of those scenarios.


103
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:59,446
The second reason to animate is
to help keep people oriented.


104
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:03,666
To help them understand where
they are within your app


105
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,356
and where they've been.


106
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:09,976
So if we just take a look at
tapping on the Back button


107
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:16,526
in Mail, for example, there's
an animation that happens.


108
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:18,966
And you can see that this
animation is communicating


109
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:21,496
something about these
screens almost being stacked


110
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,456
on top of one another.


111
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,946
But if we slow it down
and really take a look


112
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,696
at what's going on,
there's some subtlety


113
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:32,256
to this animation that's
reinforcing what's happening


114
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:33,286
as the user is going back.


115
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,476
So watch as I press
the Back button now.


116
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:40,446
You can see that the label


117
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,136
from that button becomes
the new section header


118
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,396
for where I now am.


119
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:53,536
It's subtle, but if you pay
attention to it, it's there.


120
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,466
The third reason to animate is


121
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,996
to help connect people's
behavior


122
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,776
to what's happening on screen.


123
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,296
We want people to
feel in control


124
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:06,166
of your app at all times.


125
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:11,726
If we look at Notification
Center as an example,


126
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:17,926
as I start controlling it, I can
actually see what's happening,


127
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:21,286
where my finger is, even
though you can't see my finger


128
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:21,746
in this video.


129
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:27,796
We can break this down
a little bit and think


130
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:30,286
about how we connect
people's behavior.


131
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,635
I start going into
Notification Center


132
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:36,956
by touching the top
of the screen.


133
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:42,765
Then, as my finger moves, the
Notification Center is connected


134
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:43,966
to my finger at all times.


135
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:47,456
I can see what is happening
and what's going to happen.


136
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,386
I get a hint about
what's going to happen.


137
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:53,356
And then if I flick
back up or flick down,


138
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:56,376
it will either cancel or
complete this gesture.


139
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,636
And the animation will
respond appropriately.


140
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:04,426
And perhaps even hint at how I
can reverse out of this mode.


141
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:07,896
This helps you feel in control,


142
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:10,506
but it also tells you how
the gesture itself works.


143
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:17,996
So these are three reasons we
are going to talk about today.


144
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:21,496
But how do we try
out animations?


145
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:27,026
Part of it is we want
to be able to understand


146
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,216
which animations we should use.


147
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:34,326
As we're designing our
app, we start to draw a lot


148
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:38,336
of screenshots, but these
screenshots show you too little.


149
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,516
You can't actually understand
anything about the manner


150
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:46,046
in which you're transitioning
from one screen to another


151
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:47,436
if it's not moving at all.


152
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:52,586
So we could go and build
a real working app.


153
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,446
But apps actually
show you too much.


154
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,086
There are a lot of
details involved


155
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,366
in building a full working
app that get in the way


156
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,336
of exploring many different
types of animation; right?


157
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,236
We want to be able to
try a whole lot of things


158
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:08,316
to figure out what's right.


159
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:17,156
So what we do is make
little animated experiments.


160
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,366
We find ways that we can try
out many different animations


161
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,596
because this allows us to
try built-in animations


162
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:27,926
and compare those to
custom animations.


163
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,606
Maybe we have some brilliant
new idea for an animation,


164
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,146
but we should still
compare it back


165
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,586
to what the standard iOS
one would be to make sure


166
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,426
that our intuition that this
is brilliant is right; right?


167
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:40,676
We need to see both of them.


168
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,286
So really what we
are doing here,


169
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:45,796
we think of this as
making prototypes.


170
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:46,986
Even though it's not in code,


171
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,496
we are kind of making
little experiments.


172
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,356
We are trying things
out that aren't real.


173
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,616
We are making these prototypes,
showing them to people,


174
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,376
and learning from
their feedback.


175
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,316
This is actually a
bit of a cycle; right?


176
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,926
We make things, we
show them to people,


177
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:03,276
we learn from their feedback.


178
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:05,696
Something we've talked
about a little bit before


179
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:06,466
in some other sessions.


180
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:13,606
So today, to get a more
concrete example of how we try


181
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,826
out animation, we are going to
build some animated prototypes


182
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,646
for an app that some of
you might have heard of.


183
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,316
It's called Toast Modern.


184
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:24,251
[Applause]


185
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,316
Now, it's okay if you
haven't heard of Toast Modern.


186
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,196
It still has its
original feature,


187
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:36,636
which is to help people
find local artisanal toast,


188
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:39,646
San Francisco's finest
food export.


189
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,746
But over the past year,
Toast Modern has been


190
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:46,006
so successful we've been adding
all sorts of new features.


191
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,866
People can share the toast
they found with other people.


192
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:54,356
You can comment on toast.


193
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,356
If you watched a session
yesterday, you might have seen


194
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,886
that we've connected Toast
Modern to Toastal Service.


195
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:04,886
The world's first
social toaster.


196
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,031
[Laughter]


197
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,736
And now that people are
making their own toast


198
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:12,626
and posting these pictures,
I can see my toast along


199
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:13,666
with these toast restaurants.


200
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,106
And now I can see
my friend's toast.


201
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:18,796
And frankly, the biggest
thing we are seeing


202
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:21,886
with this app now is we are just
getting overwhelmed by toast.


203
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:28,406
So today we are going to
focus on a single feature.


204
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,096
We are going to really
dive in and look


205
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:33,676
at different ways we can
animate just this one feature


206
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,646
and how we can make just
this one feature great.


207
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:40,176
What we are going to do is
slice through all this toast


208
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:41,996
to find our favorites.


209
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:47,526
Now, to do that, without
writing a line of code,


210
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,976
I would like to invite
Joe up to the stage.


211
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:55,666
[Applause]


212
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:56,886
>> JOE MALIA: Thanks, Julian.


213
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:05,686
Hi. I'm Joe, and I spend most
of my day in the team designing


214
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:09,116
and animating and not
writing very much code.


215
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:12,766
So today I am going
to be talking


216
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:17,476
about the Favorites
button in Toast Modern.


217
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:21,626
So we are going to run
through a few ideas


218
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:24,526
for how animation can
bring a feature to life.


219
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,376
We are going to look
at the process


220
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:30,016
of designing animation
into an app.


221
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:33,346
We are going to look in at a
few places where animation fits,


222
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,136
a few places that it doesn't.


223
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:39,936
Animation is a powerful
- [ding] -- I am sorry.


224
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,606
This is a little
bit embarrassing,


225
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:44,296
but I forgot to turn
my phone off.


226
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,686
So let me just -- oh,
actually, it's okay.


227
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:49,796
It's an email from
the Toast Modern CEO.


228
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:52,746
Bill, could we get this
up on screen, please?


229
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:55,406
Thanks. Okay.


230
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:56,916
So -


231
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:59,976
[Applause]


232
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:01,906
-- he's had some thoughts.


233
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:06,906
So let's see what he says.


234
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:09,986
After some deep meditation
in my yurt,


235
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:12,586
some revolutionary new ideas


236
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:15,506
for our app have come
into focus for me.


237
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:18,886
People need to know that the
Favorite button is there.


238
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:20,446
Okay? We can do that.


239
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:24,806
Two, people need to
be able to find toast


240
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:25,916
that they've favorited.


241
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:26,996
Okay. That sounds fair enough.


242
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:31,486
Three, using the Favorite button
should be simple and elegant.


243
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,816
People should be able to
use it from the first touch.


244
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:34,706
That sounds fair enough.


245
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,556
Okay? So no rush.


246
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:40,906
Just send me something to try
out in the next 20 minutes.


247
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,566
[Laughter]


248
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:44,756
Namaste. Okay.


249
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,296
[Laughter]


250
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,226
So here we go.


251
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:50,946
We haven't got much time,
so we need to dive right in.


252
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:54,946
We are going to start trying to
animate as many different ideas


253
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:58,726
as we possibly can in a short
time, get through as many


254
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:00,876
as we can quickly, and
get them onto a device.


255
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:05,006
So the designers out there
amongst you might use


256
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:08,596
After Effects or Quartz Composer
in a situation like this.


257
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:13,356
Any developers might
turn to Swift, HTML, CSS.


258
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:17,786
So these are great tools,
but for those of you


259
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,346
that don't know those
tools or don't have access


260
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:24,096
to them, there is Keynote.


261
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:27,176
And that's what we are
going to be using today


262
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,086
because it's very quick to
make animations, and it's very,


263
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:33,456
very quick to get
things onto a device.


264
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:38,276
So let's look again at
the requests from our CEO.


265
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,956
Conveniently, they map very well
to the three principles laid


266
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,616
out by Julian in his
part of the talk.


267
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:50,096
So let's focus on the
first one to begin with.


268
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,606
People need to know that the
Favorite button is there.


269
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:57,766
So let's look at an example
where animation is used


270
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:02,146
to subtly draw attention
to a feature within an app.


271
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:06,416
As we can see here, the
iBeam is blinking slowly


272
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,036
to pull people's attention
to it, to show people


273
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,586
where text will be entered
as they start to type.


274
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:15,506
It's very subtle but
actually really easy to pick


275
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,066
out amongst all the text.


276
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:20,586
What we can see here is the
change is very attractive


277
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:20,946
to the eye.


278
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:25,406
So let's think about
a few different ways


279
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,226
that we can use animation
to draw attention


280
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:29,186
to our Favorite button.


281
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:34,836
So we don't have much
time, as you have seen.


282
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:39,176
All I've done is screen-grabbed
the existing Toast Modern


283
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,366
layout, and I am just going


284
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,906
to paste it straight
into Keynote here.


285
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:45,796
So we are going to
open the shapes panel


286
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,076
and grab the star icon,
and we are going to place


287
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:51,526
that into each line in our list.


288
00:16:53,986 --> 00:16:55,076
Okay. Great.


289
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:59,396
Now let's zoom in to get
a closer look and think


290
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:01,546
about how we can change
some of the properties


291
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,376
of this button over time.


292
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:08,286
So we can change the opacity
to simulate the gentle blinking


293
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:09,516
that we saw in the
Notes app earlier.


294
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,496
Okay. That's nice.


295
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:12,756
It's pretty subtle.


296
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:14,546
How about something
more dramatic?


297
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:18,246
We could change the
rotation, the color,


298
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:20,126
the scale, at the same time.


299
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,336
We could change the shape.


300
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,935
It's just scaling down
one object and scaling


301
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:27,986
up another one quickly.


302
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:32,856
We could give it some character
by sticking some bounce in there


303
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:33,706
and adding a little face.


304
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:37,706
So we could animate the
layers at timed intervals


305
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:40,156
to create some patterns as well.


306
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:47,396
So let's zoom back out and try
that one across the entire list


307
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:51,816
to see how attention-grabbing
it is.


308
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,976
Okay. So it's definitely
grabbing attention,


309
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,586
but if it's going to be
animating constantly like this,


310
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:01,986
it could go way beyond
just grabbing attention,


311
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:03,516
actually become quite
distracting.


312
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,126
It's not really telling
us anything new


313
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,706
by animating all the time.


314
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,056
So let's look at a few
examples around iOS


315
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:16,046
where animation is used to
draw attention and have a look


316
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,396
at when it's relevant.


317
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:21,856
We see our notification
for an email appear


318
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:24,136
at the moment that
we get an email.


319
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:29,326
Okay? We see this gently pulsing
link appear when we've jumped


320
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:32,316
out of an app to
help us get back in.


321
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,496
And notifications
shift into view


322
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:38,786
when there's something very
important for us to know.


323
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,706
So the thing that these
animations have in common is


324
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,416
that they occur at the moment


325
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,576
that they are relevant
to the user.


326
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,476
They are not constantly
calling for attention.


327
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:51,186
We want people to notice
the Favorite button


328
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,196
when they first use the app.


329
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:57,766
So we can use animation
to introduce the feature


330
00:18:58,026 --> 00:18:59,056
when people launch the app.


331
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:04,366
And actually, there's
a whole bunch


332
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:06,046
of different ways we
could just move the button


333
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,276
into position like this.


334
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,146
So these are looking nice,


335
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:14,036
but they actually dominate the
action for a chunk of time,


336
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,676
and if I am just obsessed
with toast, really want to get


337
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:18,796
in there, start favoriting
toast or looking at toast,


338
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,806
they are taking up
the entire screen.


339
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:26,166
So what we want is something to
come into focus, grab attention,


340
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,756
but not take over the action.


341
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,276
So we'll just do
something like this.


342
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,456
Okay. Let's see that again.


343
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:36,536
Okay. So as I said, we
don't have much time,


344
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,046
so we are just going
to keep going.


345
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:42,786
The second part of the
email asked us to ensure


346
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:46,376
that people know where their
favorite toast has gone once


347
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:47,116
they favorited it.


348
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:52,336
So if people start to
favorite toast, as more


349
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:54,286
and more new toast is
added to that list,


350
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:56,856
their favorites are going to
end up way down that list.


351
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:58,716
They are going to be hard
to find in the future.


352
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:02,896
What we need is a
place to store a list


353
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,926
of only our favorite toast.


354
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:08,536
So let's create two buttons
at the bottom of our screen,


355
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:12,606
one that's going to
show us all of our toast


356
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:16,216
and the other one that's only
going to show us our favorites


357
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:17,276
on a different screen.


358
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:21,026
So when I tap that Favorite
button, it will animate


359
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:25,346
in from the right and back.


360
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:26,816
Okay. Great.


361
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,176
So now we've gone
through the process


362
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:33,086
of designing a simple
structure for our app.


363
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,106
Now, this might feel
like we've done enough,


364
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,186
but we can actually
go one step further.


365
00:20:39,526 --> 00:20:43,386
When someone makes a favorite,
let's use animation to hint


366
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:47,186
as to where those favorites
have ended up in the app.


367
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:53,086
So we want a model for
moving toast around our app.


368
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:56,986
So let's look at how
we might move toast


369
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,846
around in the real world
as a starting point.


370
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:07,086
So if I was to move toast
from one plate to another,


371
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:14,736
it wouldn't just disappear and
reappear on the other plate, or,


372
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,056
like, disappear out
of view altogether,


373
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,486
giving me no idea
of where it's gone.


374
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,576
Instead, as we move it,
we can keep track of it


375
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,816
by following its journey
between the plates.


376
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:32,916
Even when it moves out of sight.


377
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:36,046
So we can create connections
between different parts


378
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:40,456
of our app by moving toast
along a path like this.


379
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:44,026
We can animate this
transition in many ways.


380
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,126
So imagine that the toast gets
swallowed up by a toaster,


381
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:50,946
spat out along the path, and
ends up in the toast list.


382
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:55,626
[Applause]


383
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,876
Let's see that one
again, I think.


384
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,216
There we go.


385
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:06,606
Alternatively, we could let
the user define the shape


386
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,416
of that path by allowing them


387
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,206
to track the toast
to the Favorite area.


388
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:14,646
So we know that favorites
are off to the right.


389
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:18,296
So the toast could
move out to the right,


390
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:20,666
get gobbled up, and
then shoot back.


391
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:27,106
So as we tap the Star
button, it can expand,


392
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:31,726
swallow up the toast,
pull it over to the right.


393
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,806
Or the entire panel
could move over,


394
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:37,736
and then we could move
it back when we don't


395
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:38,926
like that toast anymore.


396
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:43,216
We have created a lot of
options to choose from.


397
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,776
That's what we are
doing, prototyping


398
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:47,446
and creating options
for ourselves.


399
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:52,036
So we created an animation
that draws attention


400
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:56,486
to our new feature, and we
prepared an animation that hints


401
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:57,966
at the structure of our app.


402
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:03,076
But the CEO wants people to
be able to use the button


403
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:06,826
from the first touch, and in
order to do that, we are going


404
00:23:06,826 --> 00:23:11,486
to think about how
animation responds to touch.


405
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:15,166
But we can begin one step
before that by looking


406
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:18,426
at how animation can suggest
how to interact with a piece


407
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,546
of toast before you've
even touched it.


408
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,216
So on the Lock screen here,


409
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,516
we can see an animated
highlight move


410
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:28,746
across the words
"Slide to Unlock."


411
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:31,456
There's meaning in
this movement.


412
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,076
It travels in the direction
you are meant to swipe.


413
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:38,136
It offers a subtle cue to
encourage the users to act


414
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:39,336
on it in a specific way.


415
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:42,756
It's elegantly foreshadowing
the interaction.


416
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:48,746
Let's see if we can create an
animation that hints to the user


417
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,166
that they should
tap this button.


418
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:52,606
So we will zoom in again.


419
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:59,256
We could move the button down
to hint that it's been pressed.


420
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:03,146
Or we could animate the shadow


421
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:04,736
of an imaginary finger
tapping it.


422
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,966
Or we could use a highlight
to give some depth and travel.


423
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,616
Let's just take that
idea quickly and try it


424
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:13,786
across our entire list.


425
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:19,856
So it's actually pretty subtle,
so we could add some color


426
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,046
to hint to the user the
change that they will see


427
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,036
when they tap the button.


428
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:28,776
Okay. So in iOS, you can
actually interact with buttons


429
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:31,726
and features in many different
ways, and the more complex


430
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,356
and sophisticated
an interaction,


431
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,426
the more foreshadowing
it may need.


432
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,976
But a tap, what we have here,
is actually very simple.


433
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:43,176
And in this case, it's
probably enough to suggest


434
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:46,156
that you can act on it
just by it being there,


435
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:48,586
just through its
presence in the app.


436
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,736
So the simplest option is best.


437
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:52,686
Let's just reserve
animation for the moment


438
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,146
that you first touch the screen.


439
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:59,136
So we want some feedback
when you first tap the app.


440
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,386
So let's start by making the
star bigger when you touch down,


441
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:05,916
and the moment that you lift
your finger up, let's imagine


442
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,866
that it travels a little way
before bouncing back down.


443
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:10,756
Okay. That's great.


444
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,766
But what we are going to
do is we are going to need


445
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,466
to get a feel for
this interaction.


446
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:17,066
So we can do that by
jumping into QuickTime


447
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,766
and screen-grabbing
the animation


448
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:20,766
that we've just created.


449
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:24,716
Then what I can do is I
can open up a movie of that


450
00:25:25,586 --> 00:25:27,566
and get a very basic
feel for the interaction


451
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:30,646
by scrubbing the timeline as
I pretend to touch the button.


452
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:34,956
So as it scales up, it is
starting to feel a little bit


453
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:36,516
like it's coming towards me.


454
00:25:36,516 --> 00:25:38,066
So this gives me the impression


455
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,316
that I can actually
drag it around.


456
00:25:39,316 --> 00:25:40,176
Now, why is that?


457
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:43,546
It kind of reminds
me of something


458
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:45,696
that we see here
in the Email app.


459
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:50,586
As I press and hold on a name,
it appears to lift off the page,


460
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,346
which gives me the
sensation I can actually start


461
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:54,226
to move it around.


462
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,606
This isn't actually
what we are after here,


463
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,506
so when we press
the Favorite button,


464
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:03,926
let's make it slightly smaller,
as if it's moving away from you.


465
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:06,266
And we could also
make it darker.


466
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:12,086
Okay. It can still bounce up
when we've lifted our finger up.


467
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:15,206
So let's integrate
that with the animation


468
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,406
that we created before,
see how it looks.


469
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:25,076
So now we are almost ready
to start favoriting toast.


470
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:28,686
Let's have a look at this.


471
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:32,256
Great. We have tackled the
three items from the CEO's list,


472
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,526
but we need to get a
feel for these animations


473
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:38,016
on a device before we
can send it back to him.


474
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:44,026
So let's head into
Keynote one last time.


475
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,236
We are going to build our
animation at this orientation,


476
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,586
the orientation of the device.


477
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:51,966
We are going to build our
animations in this format,


478
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,326
and then we are going to load
it onto the phone, open Keynote,


479
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,836
open the file, and
then we can just tap


480
00:26:58,916 --> 00:26:59,896
through the interaction.


481
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:05,746
So what I'll do is I'll grab
that animation that we created


482
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:09,296
and some of the assets
that we've created


483
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:13,266
and the pressing email from
our CEO, and I will send them


484
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,336
over to my colleague,
Marek, who is going


485
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:18,926
to start integrating some code
to raise everything up a notch.


486
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,026
So, Marek.


487
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:24,606
[Applause]


488
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,646
>> MAREK BEREZA:
Thanks a lot, Joe.


489
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,736
Hi. My name is Marek,
and I spend most


490
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:34,606
of my time making interactive
prototypes with a little bit


491
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:39,836
of code, but much less code
than you might imagine.


492
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:42,446
Now, Joe's just sent
me this Keynote file,


493
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:46,356
and it's really amazing
how far he's managed to get


494
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:48,456
without having to write
a single line of code.


495
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:53,366
But as you know, the CEO of
Toast Modern is on our backs,


496
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,196
so we really need to get
going, and we are going


497
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:56,706
to do a little bit
of programming


498
00:27:57,096 --> 00:28:00,366
to create an interactive
prototype.


499
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:03,506
Now, the main reason
to make a prototype is


500
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:07,126
so that we can get a feel for
these animations in our hand


501
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:10,596
on the device with the
interactions involved.


502
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:14,286
And only then can we ask
ourselves the questions:


503
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:15,926
Does it work?


504
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:19,986
What doesn't work
about the animation?


505
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:23,126
And then if it doesn't work,
then why doesn't it work?


506
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:30,076
So the second reason to make
interactive prototypes is


507
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,646
to let other people try it.


508
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,556
Now, maybe this is even more
important than the first point.


509
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:38,466
Now, you might be a really
good judge of your animations,


510
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:42,576
but at the end of the day,
there's just no replacement


511
00:28:42,576 --> 00:28:43,846
for an outsider's opinion.


512
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:47,766
You, yourself, have got a
strong emotional investment


513
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:48,326
in your app.


514
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,346
You spent loads of
time working on it.


515
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,506
So really, you need to find
someone who isn't invested,


516
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:56,856
someone who doesn't know what
these animations are supposed


517
00:28:56,916 --> 00:29:00,266
to say, and see if they get it.


518
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:02,356
I just quickly want to
go back to this diagram


519
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:06,136
that Julian showed earlier,
this cycle of making something,


520
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:09,926
showing someone, and then
learning from their feedback.


521
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,696
It's really important to
take what you've learned


522
00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:15,266
and put it back into
the making process


523
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:20,306
so you can keep iterating
until you get it right.


524
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:23,916
Now, the third reason is so
that you can make changes


525
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:24,966
really easily.


526
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,366
If you try doing
this sort of stuff


527
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,106
with production-style code,


528
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:31,616
you end up writing
quite a lot of code.


529
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:34,836
And then when you want to make a
small change, you end up having


530
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:37,296
to scrap a lot of code and
then write a lot more code.


531
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:41,476
So if you make these little
interactive prototypes,


532
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:45,366
then you end up saving yourself
a lot of time and money.


533
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:49,536
Now, what are these
interactive prototype things?


534
00:29:50,336 --> 00:29:53,156
Well, essentially, we are
going to build an app,


535
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:56,966
but we are going to cut as
many corners as we possibly can


536
00:29:57,306 --> 00:30:00,746
to create the illusion
of a fully fledged app


537
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:02,396
so we can test out
our animations.


538
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:07,076
The easiest way that I can
think to do this is rather


539
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:09,116
than using navigation
controllers


540
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:10,906
and all these UI controls,


541
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,856
we are just going
to work with images.


542
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:17,616
So I've taken a few
screenshots from Joe's Keynote.


543
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:21,766
We've got one picture of
the main app with that row


544
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,486
that we are going to
make interactive missing.


545
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:26,056
We've got one picture of the row


546
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:27,866
that we are going
to make interactive.


547
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,286
And then that same row,
the favorited version.


548
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:34,546
And this is what
our code looks like.


549
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:35,596
It's very rough.


550
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,216
We've got three lines of code


551
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:40,316
to load those three
images we just saw.


552
00:30:41,426 --> 00:30:44,756
This block of code adds
those images as subviews


553
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:47,476
to our main view and
puts them into place.


554
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:50,876
Then this block of code
listens for a touch event,


555
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,376
and when it gets a touch event,


556
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:56,036
it animates that favorites row
off to the right-hand side,


557
00:30:56,036 --> 00:31:00,386
and then it brings the favorited
version of the row from behind.


558
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:04,296
So running it on the phone
looks something like this.


559
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:08,466
We've got a working prototype,
15 lines of code, 3 pictures.


560
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:09,546
Couldn't be easier.


561
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:14,246
We can try it out straightaway,
and as soon as we tried it out,


562
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:17,586
we discovered something
wrong, and that was


563
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:20,966
that when we put our finger
down initially, nothing happens.


564
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,916
Joe mentioned something
about this.


565
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,186
When you put your finger
down on most buttons in iOS,


566
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:29,456
they respond to you, and it's
really important that they do


567
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:32,606
because it's telling you that
this isn't just a static part


568
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,636
of the screen, it's
an interactive thing.


569
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:40,356
In order to dig into
this problem deeper,


570
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:45,006
a really good way to do this is
to break down the interaction.


571
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:50,656
Most interactions can be
broken down into the stages


572
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:58,836
of the start, the
change, and the complete.


573
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:04,906
And each of these stages
is an opportunity for you


574
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:10,596
to help guide the user on their
way through the interaction.


575
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,336
Now let's think of
this in terms of touch.


576
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:17,656
We've got the start, which
might be our touchdown.


577
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:21,456
We've got the change,
which is moving your finger


578
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:22,346
across the screen.


579
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:25,546
And then the complete, when you
lift your finger off the screen.


580
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:29,846
And in programming, we
think of touches began,


581
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,196
touches moved, and
touches ended.


582
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:35,566
Now let's go back to
our Favorites button.


583
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:39,646
So as the finger goes down, we
need to respond to the user.


584
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:42,206
Maybe we can just
make that star grow


585
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:44,556
or do something a little
bit more intelligent


586
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:46,206
as to what Joe is talking about.


587
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:49,676
Now, moving your finger
around on a button,


588
00:32:50,116 --> 00:32:52,756
maybe if the user moves
their finger off the button,


589
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:55,016
we can allow them to move out --


590
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:59,066
I mean, to back out of what
the action is going to do.


591
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:03,026
So maybe for the animation,
we just reverse that animation


592
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:04,366
to go back to the start


593
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:07,906
to reassure the user
nothing is going to happen.


594
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:09,896
And then finally,
the complete stage.


595
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:11,746
If they want to complete,


596
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:16,346
we have to make sure we reward
the user, make sure they know


597
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:19,316
that they favorited the toast.


598
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:22,896
So I am not going to go through
every single line of code here


599
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:24,246
because it's a little
bit longer,


600
00:33:24,246 --> 00:33:27,066
and also my code is
a little bit messy,


601
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,976
and I guess that's the
point that I want to get


602
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:32,736
across is the fact that this
is not an engineering exercise.


603
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:36,396
We really just want you
to hack it together.


604
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:37,716
I give you my full permission.


605
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:43,736
And secondly, really try and
use images wherever you can.


606
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:45,436
You will be amazed at
what you can get away


607
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,206
with with this sort of fakery.


608
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:50,746
And then thirdly, there
is a really nice suite


609
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,456
of animation functions, which
you probably already know,


610
00:33:53,456 --> 00:33:57,316
which is Animate with
Duration in the UIView class.


611
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,416
So here's our prototype.


612
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,886
We've got something we can
get someone to try out.


613
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:04,306
So let's try it out on others.


614
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:09,985
So I took it to my next-door
neighbor, which coincidentally,


615
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:12,036
he's a massive toast fan,


616
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,795
so he was really
excited to try it out.


617
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:18,295
And he came back
with some concise


618
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:20,116
but very revealing feedback.


619
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:24,626
And that was, I really liked
how it felt, but surely,


620
00:34:24,726 --> 00:34:25,746
shouldn't it be a swipe?


621
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,716
Now, he's got a point here.


622
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,706
The animation even
goes off to the right.


623
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:31,846
It looks like a swipe.


624
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:34,126
And this is a really
good example


625
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:37,516
of how your outsider's opinion
can really give you these


626
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:40,926
insights of things that, in
hindsight, are really obvious,


627
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:44,005
but we just didn't see
it because we were too


628
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,545
in the process of the project.


629
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:51,706
So maybe he is alluding to
this nice animation in Mail


630
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:54,255
where you can swipe
to mark as Unread.


631
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:57,036
So let's try a swipe gesture.


632
00:34:57,616 --> 00:34:59,986
Let's think of it in
terms of our start,


633
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,686
change, and complete model.


634
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:05,696
So in the start, we've
got the finger going down.


635
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:07,916
As the finger goes down, we need


636
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,066
to determine whether the
user is trying to swipe


637
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:12,926
or whether they want
to scroll or just tap.


638
00:35:12,926 --> 00:35:16,396
And the way we do this
really easily is we just look


639
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,176
at the initial movement
of the finger,


640
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:22,346
and if it moves far
enough horizontally


641
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:24,336
without moving too
much vertically,


642
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:25,676
we know it's a swipe.


643
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:28,776
So essentially, we are
setting some sort of threshold.


644
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,346
And only once a user has passed


645
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:34,686
that threshold do we start
this connected behavior.


646
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:38,296
So now we are in
the change state,


647
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:40,046
where the user can
move this row.


648
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:44,426
Maybe we can prompt them
with a little message saying


649
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:45,796
if they carry on swiping,


650
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,736
then they are going
to favorite this row.


651
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:52,556
And so hopefully
intuitively they get the idea


652
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:54,046
that they can back
out at this stage


653
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:57,346
by letting go or by moving back.


654
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,776
So this is what it would
look like on the phone.


655
00:35:59,776 --> 00:36:03,096
And then finally, the complete.


656
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:07,236
If the user carries on swiping,
we need to make sure, again,


657
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,976
they know that they
favorited this row.


658
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:12,596
So we've got our prototype.


659
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:14,676
I tried it out on my
next-door neighbor.


660
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:16,876
He seemed to really
like it, maybe partly


661
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:20,426
because it was his idea
in the first place.


662
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:23,236
And we are ready to
send it off to the CEO


663
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:25,016
to see what he thinks.


664
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:29,886
So he's usually quite quick
at getting back to us.


665
00:36:30,246 --> 00:36:31,926
[Ding] Oh, there he is.


666
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:34,016
Hi, Marek.


667
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:36,876
Thirty seconds ago I decided to
turn my life around and switch


668
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:39,896
to a gluten-free paleo diet.


669
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,056
I feel better already.


670
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,606
The future is drinkable
meal replacements.


671
00:36:46,486 --> 00:36:49,146
Now I don't even need to
leave my standing desk to eat.


672
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:52,706
I need a prototype
in 45 minutes.


673
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:54,116
Have a great weekend.


674
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:56,166
So of course, I am going
to have a great weekend.


675
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:59,456
Anyway, that's interactive
prototypes.


676
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:03,576
Hopefully now you can see
that it's really easy to test


677
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:06,506
out your animations before
you build out your whole app


678
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,656
so that later on down the line
you are not going to get burnt.


679
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:12,006
I'm going to hand
you back to Julian


680
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:13,666
for a quick toast
mortem of the session.


681
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:17,016
[Applause]


682
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:18,636
>> JULIAN MISSIG:
Thank you, Marek.


683
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:19,746
Thank you, Marek.


684
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:25,006
So what did we learn
today about animation?


685
00:37:25,006 --> 00:37:29,996
We learned that we can think of
animation as a change over time.


686
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:35,636
We still need to go back
and design our screens,


687
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:38,196
figure out what should be
on each screen if we run


688
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:39,636
into difficulty with
our animations.


689
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:44,916
The manner in which you change
over time can be thought


690
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,076
of in two different ways.


691
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:49,016
It's both practical, it
communicates something


692
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,436
about how all the different
parts of your app fit together.


693
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:52,956
And it's artful.


694
00:37:53,476 --> 00:37:55,566
It tells you something
about the character


695
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:59,056
of your app, how it feels.


696
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:04,326
We have three different reasons
why we might want to animate.


697
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,286
We can animate to direct
people's attention.


698
00:38:07,446 --> 00:38:09,686
We can animate to help
keep people oriented.


699
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:13,936
And we can animate to
connect people's behavior


700
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:18,426
to what's happening on screen.


701
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:22,876
We briefly touched on this
prototyping process we've


702
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,156
described a couple of times
where we want to make a lot


703
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:28,916
of things so that we can
show people a lot of things,


704
00:38:29,336 --> 00:38:30,566
so we can learn a lot of things.


705
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:32,656
The more that we can do this,


706
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:35,506
the more that we can learn
before we invest time and money


707
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:37,736
in building the real apps.


708
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:42,076
If you would like to learn more
about this prototyping process,


709
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:47,096
there was a session at last
year's WWDC specifically


710
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:47,886
on prototyping.


711
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,916
And yesterday, there
was a session Designing


712
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:53,646
for Future Hardware, that
applies this prototyping process


713
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,736
to apps connected to devices.


714
00:38:56,446 --> 00:38:58,586
Both of these should be
available in videos online.


715
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:00,696
You should certainly also check


716
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:03,876
out all the other design
sessions for more information


717
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:08,076
on how you can be
designing all these screens.


718
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:13,706
But finally, we would like to
leave you with just one thought.


719
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:20,876
We want you to go out there and
use animation to add character


720
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,076
to your apps and games.


721
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:28,986
But please do so thoughtfully.


722
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:31,716
The whole point of this is


723
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:36,356
that we can't understand what
the animation communicates


724
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:39,556
or how it feels without
trying it.


725
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:43,336
So find ways to try animations,
whatever those ways may be.


726
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:44,386
Thank you all.


727
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,500
[Applause]
