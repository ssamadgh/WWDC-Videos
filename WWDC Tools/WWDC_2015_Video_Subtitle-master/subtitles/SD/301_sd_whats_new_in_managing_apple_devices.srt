00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,966
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Good morning
and welcome to session 301.


2
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:24,376
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I manage
Apple's device management tools


3
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:27,246
engineering teams and help
coordinate our efforts


4
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,416
across the company
to support deploying


5
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:30,766
and managing Apple devices.


6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,296
I'm excited to be here
with you this morning


7
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:36,306
to represent the many teams
across Apple that have been hard


8
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:39,586
at work since we last met
and introduce what's new


9
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:40,886
in managing Apple devices.


10
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:46,316
Apple's commitment to education
and enterprise goes back


11
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:47,546
to the beginning of the company.


12
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,696
Serving the needs of educators


13
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,456
and students has been
an important part


14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,176
of Apple throughout its history.


15
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:58,156
Today, there's a whole new world
of devices and content available


16
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:59,326
to teachers and students.


17
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:03,136
Technology can now be completely
integrated, both inside


18
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:05,626
and outside of the classroom.


19
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:10,106
But those devices and content
are also critically important


20
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:10,916
in the enterprise.


21
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:12,536
Though Apple's success


22
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:15,456
in the enterprise today
dwarfs any past successes,


23
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:18,646
Apple's interest in fostering
increased productivity


24
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,756
and enterprise started a long
time ago with the VisiCalc


25
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:24,436
on the Apple II and
continues through the myriad


26
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:27,836
of solutions now based on
iPhones, iPads, and Macs.


27
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:31,206
From the factory
floor to the office.


28
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:34,746
So how can we make it
even easier for schools


29
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:37,256
and businesses to take full
advantage of everything


30
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,856
that the Apple ecosystem offers?


31
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:44,596
Since the introduction of iPhone
and accelerating with iPad,


32
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,766
Apple has created key
technologies and services


33
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:49,876
to enable schools and businesses


34
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,146
to make the most
of their devices.


35
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,486
This year we are building
on that foundation


36
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:57,976
with a special emphasis on
shared device deployments.


37
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,296
Now, I need to take a moment
for a brief aside here.


38
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,676
I likely will be referring
to these two programs


39
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:06,496
by their three-letter
acronyms, DEP and VPP,


40
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:07,636
throughout this presentation,


41
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,406
but I owe marketing a dollar
every time I call a Device


42
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:15,686
Enrollment Program a dep. If
I slip, don't give me away.


43
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,386
I appreciate it.


44
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:20,526
All these device management
features really boil


45
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:24,056
down to helping you spend less
time with your devices looking


46
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:27,646
like this and more
time with your students


47
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,686
and employees using them
to do things like this.


48
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:35,316
Now, today we are going to cover
the entire deployment process,


49
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:38,226
highlighting all the new
features in both OSs,


50
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,556
the services and
tools along the way.


51
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:46,366
The first step is to enroll your
devices for remote management.


52
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,416
Of course, the best way
to do that is using DEP,


53
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,126
the Device Enrollment Program.


54
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:53,886
Before we jump into the
new features, though,


55
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:56,686
I want to take a moment
to highlight two changes


56
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,026
that have already taken place.


57
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,136
The first is that we've expanded


58
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:03,796
from our initial
launch in two countries.


59
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:07,556
The program is now available in
26 countries around the world.


60
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:11,506
And we've dramatically
shortened the time it takes


61
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:14,566
to get replacement
devices into the program.


62
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,006
So that's great.


63
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:20,386
Now let's talk about what
is new and coming this year.


64
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:23,086
The first feature I want to talk


65
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,956
about is called Enrollment
Optimization.


66
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,126
You might be thinking,
what does that mean?


67
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,296
It's actually very simple.


68
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,726
This is a way for the MDM
server managing the device


69
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:35,156
to keep the device
in Setup Assistant


70
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:36,486
until it is fully configured.


71
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,476
This ensures that before
a user can use the device,


72
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:42,736
all the settings,
accounts, and restrictions


73
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,136
that the organization
wants to have


74
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:46,356
in place are actually in place.


75
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,976
So how does it work?


76
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:53,106
There's a new key that is
part of the DEP settings


77
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:56,176
that specifies that you
want the device to wait


78
00:03:56,176 --> 00:03:57,226
until it's fully configured.


79
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:01,976
When the device obtains its
Device Enrollment Program


80
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,436
settings from the service,
when it is enrolling


81
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:08,366
with the MDM server, it passes
that state back to the server.


82
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:12,406
The server then knows it can
take as many MDM commands


83
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,256
and install as many
configuration profiles


84
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,036
as necessary to fully
configure that device.


85
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,646
Once the device is
fully configured,


86
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:22,796
the server sends a New
Device Configured command


87
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,496
to the device, allowing
it to exit Setup Assistant


88
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,486
and be used by the end user.


89
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:33,886
This is available in both
iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.


90
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:37,176
Next I want to talk about
a feature specific to OS X


91
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:41,336
that gives you more control
over how accounts are created,


92
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:44,376
or not created as the case
may be, during enrollment.


93
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:49,546
In fact, you can now prevent
user creation entirely


94
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:53,096
if you just want to use
network accounts on your Macs.


95
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:55,356
This works great with
Enrollment Optimization


96
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:57,306
if you set a passcode policy.


97
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,186
That policy will be enforced


98
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,796
when the user is creating
their new account.


99
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:05,746
One of the most important
changes is that now instead


100
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:09,806
of the user creating an admin
account during DEP enrollment,


101
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,316
you can specify that that
account will be a standard


102
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:14,816
account, which is typically
what you want in education.


103
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:18,266
However, because
OS X, of course,


104
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:22,096
requires an admin account to be
on the system, if you specify


105
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,616
that the standard
account will be created,


106
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:27,026
you can also create an admin
account behind the scenes


107
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:28,296
that you can later use


108
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,596
for remote management
via ARD or other tools.


109
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,726
And you can optionally
hide that admin account


110
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,516
from any standard
users on the system.


111
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,016
All these settings can be
configured using a new MDM


112
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:41,956
command called Setup
Configuration, which works well


113
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:45,316
in conjunction with Enrollment
Optimization [applause].


114
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:47,426
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
This is great.


115
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,846
It will be very key in
education in particular.


116
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,866
Now let's turn to iOS 9
and to a feature again


117
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,196
with a somewhat ambiguous
name, but I'll explain.


118
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,016
Also very simple to explain.


119
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,536
Automated Enrollment is a
way to enroll your devices


120
00:06:01,656 --> 00:06:03,916
in MDM using the Device
Enrollment Program


121
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:07,416
without anyone tapping
on the device.


122
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,256
How does it work?


123
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:13,446
Well, the first step is you
configure your DEP settings


124
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:14,276
like you would today,


125
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,826
but instead of having a
user get the device and walk


126
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:21,166
through the Setup Assistant,
you will connect the device


127
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,756
to Apple Configurator,
which will tell the device


128
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:26,396
"configure yourself
using your DEP settings."


129
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,146
The device obtains
those settings


130
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,786
and fully configures itself
all the way to the Home screen.


131
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,376
It's ready for the user to use


132
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:36,216
without anyone touching
the device.


133
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:39,246
This is a great feature
for shared deployments


134
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:42,846
in particular, enabling you
to configure a cart of iPads


135
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:45,516
without touching them beyond
connecting the USB cable.


136
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:52,166
This is not a new
feature per se,


137
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,096
but we've expanded the number
of Setup Assistant panes


138
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,306
that you can choose
to skip as part


139
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,106
of your Device Enrollment
Program settings.


140
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,836
Over the past year, we
rolled out these three panes,


141
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:06,476
but in iOS 9 you can also remove
the new Move From Android option


142
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:09,106
on the setup pane if
your enterprise wants


143
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:11,016
to make sure there's no
corporate data leaking


144
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,906
from their Android devices
while they're transitioning


145
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:14,946
to an iOS device.


146
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:16,516
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Finally I would


147
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,726
like to highlight something
I mentioned last year, that,


148
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:24,066
analogous to what the
MDM server can obtain


149
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,166
from the iTunes Store,
to get the Store Bag,


150
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,086
which tells you all the
APIs and URLs you can use


151
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:32,846
to control the VPP
program and other tasks,


152
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,896
MDM servers can implement
what we call MDMServiceConfig,


153
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:40,146
which will tell other device
management tools, for example,


154
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,586
Configurator, what kinds
of services it provides,


155
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,786
the most important being
the DEP enrollment URL.


156
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:48,646
Why is that important?


157
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,926
In fact, the Profile
Manager version


158
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:53,926
that we seeded this
week supports this,


159
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:56,756
and Apple Configurator we
seeded this week supports it.


160
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,866
And enables Configurator user,
instead of having to type


161
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,256
in the entire URL, can
just type in the host name


162
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:06,236
of the MDM server and
obtain the URL for the user.


163
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:10,476
So that brings us to the end
of the enrollment section.


164
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,156
We now have our devices
enrolled, they're ready


165
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:13,026
for remote management.


166
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:16,806
The next thing we want to
do is deploy the great apps


167
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,056
from the App Store
and other sources.


168
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:23,006
Of course, there are,
what did we say yesterday?


169
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,576
A million and a half
apps in the App Store.


170
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:28,076
There are also a large number
of B2B apps in the App Store.


171
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,506
There are in-house
enterprise apps


172
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,135
that your organizations
may be creating,


173
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:35,996
and developers may be using
ad hoc apps to distribute,


174
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,535
for beta testing
or other purposes,


175
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:38,946
using provisioning profiles.


176
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:42,785
I will talk primarily today
about the first three,


177
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,746
but there is something
towards the end


178
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:47,016
of the presentation also
potentially relevant


179
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:48,206
for that fourth type.


180
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,616
There are many different ways
to distribute apps to users,


181
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,736
but today I'm going to
primarily focus on Apple's tools


182
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,066
as well as MDM in general.


183
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:01,286
Finally, there are three
different ways to purchase apps.


184
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,366
Your users, of course,
can just go


185
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,426
to the App Store and buy them.


186
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,326
We have VPP redemption codes,


187
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,306
which transfer ownership
to the user.


188
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,446
Finally two years ago,


189
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:13,546
we introduced VPP
managed distribution


190
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:17,086
to give organizations greater
control and preserve ownership


191
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:20,336
of the apps they buy under
the Volume Purchase Program.


192
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,126
That's what I want to spend
our time right now on.


193
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:28,966
There are three big new changes
that I want to highlight today,


194
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,626
each one larger than the last.


195
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:35,156
The first is similar to the
Device Enrollment Program.


196
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,476
Over the past year we
expanded from 10 countries


197
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:39,226
to the same 26 countries


198
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:41,176
where the Device Enrollment
Program is available.


199
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:42,746
That's great.


200
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,316
But the second item I want


201
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:47,746
to mention is bigger
and builds on this.


202
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:50,176
We now have multinational
app assignment as part


203
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,636
of VPP managed distribution.


204
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:52,936
What does that mean [applause]?


205
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:56,826
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Maybe you know already!


206
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,376
We can go right through
this slide quickly.


207
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:02,236
What that means is you can
purchase your VPP apps in any


208
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:06,346
of those 26 countries, but
distribute them to any country


209
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:07,836
where that app is
in the App Store.


210
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:09,606
So to make it concrete,


211
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:12,206
if you are a multinational
company headquartered in France,


212
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:15,216
you can buy all your apps in
France but distribute them


213
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,016
to your users in the U.S.,
Canada, or even Kenya,


214
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,356
as long as that app is in
the App Store in Kenya.


215
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:22,826
We think this is
going to be huge.


216
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:26,626
Believe it or not, the next
one is even bigger than this.


217
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,366
You can now assign your VPP mass
distribution apps to devices.


218
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:35,606
[ Applause ]


219
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:36,476
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Thank you.


220
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,506
We appreciate that.


221
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,476
So previously you could
assign them to users,


222
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:42,556
and iTunes Store Apple ID.


223
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,986
What is different about
device assignments?


224
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:48,156
Now there is no invitation
process if you want


225
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,276
to use device assignments


226
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:51,866
because there's no Apple ID
required on the device in order


227
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:55,936
to distribute the apps,
install them, and run.


228
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:59,716
Even if there is an iTunes Apple
ID configured on the device,


229
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:02,316
these apps will not appear in
the user's purchase history


230
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:04,136
because they are not
assigned to that user.


231
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:08,346
That further means there is
no way for the user to manage


232
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:12,196
that app, or install it, or
update it in the device UI.


233
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,636
It's completely at the
discretion of the administrator


234
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:16,806
and the MDM server to
control that timing.


235
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,176
A final difference I want
to highlight is that,


236
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:23,286
in contrast to user assignments,
where that app can be installed


237
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:26,526
on any device where that iTunes
Store Apple ID is configured,


238
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:29,096
if you are using device
assignments you need


239
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:32,766
to purchase a copy for each
device, and you app developers


240
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,276
out there should be
happy about that.


241
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:35,186
More sales!


242
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,096
But I also want to repeat,
there is no Apple ID required


243
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,936
on the device in
order to install apps.


244
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:48,056
[ Cheers & Applause ]


245
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:49,956
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Another big step forward


246
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,156
to make shared device
deployments much easier.


247
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:55,856
So what has remained the same?


248
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,846
The purchasing experience
is exactly the same.


249
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:03,066
You purchase VPP managed
distribution licenses


250
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:08,106
on the VPP store, and they can
be freely reassigned to a user


251
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:10,706
or a device and later
revoked and assigned


252
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:11,996
to a different user or device.


253
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:14,376
We've also worked very hard


254
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:17,306
to make sure there's a smooth
transition for all of the apps


255
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:20,196
that have already been installed
based on user assignments.


256
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,346
If you wish, you can transfer
and transition that assignment


257
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:27,366
to a device assignment without
having to reinstall the app


258
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,966
or risk losing user data.


259
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,706
The app stays in place,
as does the user data.


260
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:38,686
[ Applause ]


261
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:40,886
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: So what does
this mean for app developers?


262
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:42,826
It is actually pretty simple.


263
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:46,416
First of all, early next month,
iTunes Connect will allow you


264
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,566
to opt in to allow your
app to be distributed


265
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,626
as a device assignment.


266
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,166
This is probably a good idea.


267
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,246
Remember that piece I mentioned,
you might sell more copies?


268
00:12:57,146 --> 00:13:00,486
Also, if your app is
checking the receipt to ensure


269
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:04,486
that it is running on a device
where a user is configured


270
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,296
that is the same user
the app is assigned to,


271
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,586
you'll want to update
that checking to do


272
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,386
that to make sure it's
running on the device


273
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:12,836
that it's been assigned to.


274
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,376
Secondly, I want to make a pitch


275
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,836
that device assignments
are a great feature


276
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:19,506
for shared device
deployments, but another one


277
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:22,466
for you app developers is to
move, if you haven't already,


278
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:25,066
to store your app's data
and settings in the cloud,


279
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,456
whether it's Apple's
cloud with iCloud Drive


280
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,166
if you're document-based,
or CloudKit,


281
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,116
or your own cloud-based storage.


282
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,936
This will help your app fit in
better in shared deployments.


283
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:39,266
There are a number of sessions
this week that will show you how


284
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,856
to do that with our
own solutions.


285
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:42,666
I encourage you to
check those out.


286
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,866
I also want to highlight
a change


287
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,366
to the caching server
feature of OS X server,


288
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:55,886
which already caches
OS updates and apps.


289
00:13:56,546 --> 00:14:01,666
It now caches also iCloud data,
including Drive documents,


290
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,366
CloudKit data, and iCloud
photo library photos.


291
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,456
And those of you who have
now heard about App Thinning


292
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:10,196
and on-demand resources, it
will also cache those as well.


293
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,816
It just preheats the cache
of cloud data on your network


294
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:16,056
to give you better performance
and reduce your bandwidth,


295
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,566
and of course all of the data


296
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:21,596
in the cache is encrypted
using keys only present


297
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:22,786
on the client device.


298
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:28,116
So turning to what this
means for MDM developers,


299
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:31,986
if you are supporting VPP
managed distribution already,


300
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,406
there are a few changes
to the iTunes Store APIs,


301
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,046
which I'll cover in a moment.


302
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,236
You will use the same
Install Application command


303
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:42,166
to the device to tell
it to install this app.


304
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:45,686
You obviously should now
support assigning apps


305
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,046
to devices and device groups.


306
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,066
We've built all of
this to make it easier


307
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,506
to centralize the app's
management workflows.


308
00:14:52,506 --> 00:14:54,906
It will be much more reliable
with device assignments


309
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:58,636
to be able if you wish to unify
the assignment in the Store


310
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,306
with the installation
command to the device.


311
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:06,386
So what are the changes for the
Install Application command?


312
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:10,026
Well, if the app is not
installed, it will install it.


313
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:13,386
If it already has been
installed by the MDM server


314
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:15,116
and is managed, it
will update it.


315
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,086
If the user already
installed the app so it's


316
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:21,396
in an unmanaged state, the
installation will fail,


317
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:23,316
so your server will
need to handle that case


318
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:24,406
and respond appropriately.


319
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,696
For those of you who are already
supporting this for OS X,


320
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,796
hopefully all of you, for
device assignments you want


321
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:34,446
to use the same purchase method
you have been using on OS X,


322
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:37,406
purchase method one for
iOS device assignments.


323
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:40,146
That's the command
to the device.


324
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:42,416
Now let's turn to the
command for the iTunes Store


325
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,146
to update its records on which
app is assigned to which device.


326
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,856
There are two new APIs that
should make implementing support


327
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:53,126
for VPP managed distribution
much easier.


328
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:59,216
The first supersedes the
separate commands to associate


329
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:01,246
and disassociate
licenses with users.


330
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,596
And it allows you to, with
one call for a single app,


331
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,846
to associate with any
number of users or devices


332
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:12,106
and disassociate any
number of users or devices.


333
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,896
This will make it
very easy to implement


334
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,726
that smooth migration
I mentioned earlier.


335
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:21,956
The second API gives you
an easy way to get the list


336
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:24,946
of apps the organization has
purchased, including the number


337
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,906
of licenses of each app
that they have purchased


338
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,586
without having to
fetch the entire list


339
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,446
of every single license
they purchased.


340
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:35,056
This will make it much easier to
build a responsive app library


341
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,036
in your admin console.


342
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:41,116
Moving on to an existing API


343
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,296
that has gotten several
new fields.


344
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:48,126
There are max limits for
the number of licenses


345
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:52,206
that manage VPP licenses,
API just mentioned.


346
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,666
You want to respect these values
when you're calling that API


347
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:58,586
to not call with
more than that number


348
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:01,766
of licenses in a single call.


349
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:05,415
We also have added a new
Retry After header because,


350
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:06,965
how can I say this delicately?


351
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:07,506
I'll be blunt.


352
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:12,526
Some of you, and we know who
you are, have some MDM solutions


353
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:15,566
that let's just say they
send a few too many requests


354
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:16,465
to the iTunes store.


355
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:21,596
We need you to fix that but
also respect this header


356
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,955
because if your solution
continues to do that,


357
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:29,006
we will send this header and
we may, if you ignore it,


358
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,536
create longer delays in
rejecting your commands


359
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:35,566
and potentially even suspend
the account of your customer.


360
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:39,256
So please, adopt this.


361
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,416
All right.


362
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,646
So moving away from strictly
VPP managed distribution


363
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,936
to some more general
app distribution topics.


364
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,796
There are a few things
that are new.


365
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:51,086
Really, they are
just more convenient.


366
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:54,626
The first is reiterating
the point I made earlier


367
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:57,436
that we've made a very
smooth migration from user


368
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:00,186
to device assignments to leave
the app and data in place.


369
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,906
Secondly, if the app has
already been installed unmanaged


370
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,696
by the user, it is now
possible to convert that app


371
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:09,926
to managed state without
having to reinstall


372
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:10,866
or lose user data [applause].


373
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,696
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: I'll give
you the details in a moment,


374
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:21,356
but the third change is that
you can now install apps via MDM


375
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,806
or Configurator even if
you disabled the App Store.


376
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:27,856
Great improvement for
education in particular.


377
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:29,876
How does this work?


378
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:34,366
Changing an app from unmanaged
state to managed state is


379
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,016
as simple as sending a new
Install Application command,


380
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:40,036
with this new field, Change
Management State equals Managed.


381
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:44,006
And this will happen silently
on a supervised device.


382
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:44,826
That's it.


383
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:48,436
If it's an unsupervised
device, you can use this,


384
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,736
but the user will be
prompted to accept the change.


385
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:55,016
Once that change has happened,
managed open in will consider


386
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,096
that app to be managed and
all of that data will be


387
00:18:57,096 --> 00:19:00,626
within the managed sphere,
just as if it had always been.


388
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,126
If the app is not
installed at all,


389
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,236
and you're passing this call,


390
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:06,296
it will still install
the app as a managed app.


391
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:09,766
That's great.


392
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:14,136
This works for App Store apps,
all the different types of apps.


393
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:17,796
Let's talk about changes
for enterprise apps.


394
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:21,406
We've created in iOS 9 a new
UI flow to make it easier


395
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:22,876
for the user to understand


396
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:24,776
when they are installing
an enterprise app


397
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:25,956
from a new developer.


398
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,556
I'll show you what
that looks like.


399
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:31,906
We also made it easier for
you to avoid your users


400
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:35,046
from ever having to see that
great new user experience


401
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:37,976
because you can prevent
them from trusting new apps


402
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:41,556
from other developers so that
they can only use your in-house


403
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,386
enterprise apps.


404
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:45,536
And if they have enrolled
with your MDM server,


405
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:49,766
they have implicitly given their
trust to you as a developer,


406
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:52,926
and so any apps that
you install the MDM


407
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,276
that are your enterprise
in-house apps will be


408
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,106
installed silently.


409
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:01,576
[ Applause ]


410
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,726
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: So if
it is an enterprise app


411
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:05,546
from a developer that
they haven't trusted yet,


412
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:06,476
what does that look like?


413
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,036
Well, it looks like this.


414
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:13,766
After they installed the app
and launch it, they can dismiss


415
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:18,256
that alert and then switch over
to Settings and the profiles


416
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:20,426
and remote management
area of Settings,


417
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:23,666
which was changed quite a
bit and improved in iOS 8,


418
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,226
they can trust the app.


419
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:27,886
And that's it.


420
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,536
And then any further apps


421
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:31,856
from that developer will
be automatically trusted,


422
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,176
but they can also always come
back here and remove that trust.


423
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,336
It's just that easy.


424
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:41,336
Let's now turn to B2B apps.


425
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:45,166
Those of you who have
worked on MDM console


426
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,036
or have used one know
that it's really great.


427
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:51,226
You can have an app library
that has the nice app metadata


428
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:54,126
with the icon, the app name,
and any other details about it.


429
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:58,726
But if it's a B2B app, it
looks something more like this.


430
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:02,786
Wa Wa. Well, I really
have good news for you.


431
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:05,636
Later this summer
you will be able


432
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:08,376
to get the same app metadata
for B2B apps that you can


433
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:09,466
for App Store apps today.


434
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,766
So you can make a nice
experience for your users.


435
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:15,436
What's more, that will also
allow you to get the metadata


436
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:17,506
for any apps that have been
removed from the App Store.


437
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:22,276
I thought you would be
more enthusiastic about it.


438
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,586
Where are all the MDM
developers [applause]?


439
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:27,666
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: All right.


440
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,206
At this point, we reached the
end of our distribution section.


441
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:33,846
I would like to ask Shruti Gupta
to come up here and demo a bunch


442
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:37,026
of these features on Macs
running OS X El Capitan.


443
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:39,086
Take it away.


444
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:44,956
>> SHRUTI GUPTA: Good
morning, everyone.


445
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,796
I am each excited to show
you some of the cool features


446
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:48,976
that Todd talked about.


447
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:52,766
The first thing I will demo
are the new enhancements


448
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:55,506
that we have made in account
creation and password policy.


449
00:21:56,086 --> 00:22:02,326
So here is my profile
manager in OS X server.


450
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:07,396
I am using this profile manager
server as my MDM solution


451
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:10,116
where I have a couple of
Macs that are registered


452
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:11,536
in Device Enrollment Program.


453
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:13,476
If you look at the settings,


454
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:16,676
you can see that I've
already created DEP profile


455
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:17,476
for the device group.


456
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:21,666
I have skipped all the
Setup Assistant panes except


457
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,056
for the local account setup.


458
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,006
This is a new feature
that would force the user


459
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,886
to create a standard
user account.


460
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:31,306
Since OS X requires
an administer account,


461
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,746
I provided administrator
credentials here.


462
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,646
You have the ability to show


463
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,886
or hide this administrator
account from the user.


464
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,616
For today's demonstration
purpose I will hide the


465
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:41,686
administrator account.


466
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:47,576
I have also configured a
passcode profile for these Macs


467
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:49,496
that would require the user


468
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:51,816
to use a complex password
during this setup time.


469
00:22:52,396 --> 00:22:54,106
What does this look
like on the client?


470
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:54,896
Let's take a look.


471
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:58,936
So here is my Mac that
is registered in DEP


472
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:02,556
and has been booted for the
first time OS X El Capitan,


473
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:04,886
mimicking out-of-box
user experience.


474
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:06,316
Let's go through the setup.


475
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:10,746
I select the United States
for my country, U.S. keyboard.


476
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:16,706
Here we are at the configuration
pane, which you will see only


477
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:21,436
if the systems are configured
in DEP. So we come to them.


478
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,416
Now, the MDM server is
prompting me to authenticate


479
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,946
that my directory
server credentials.


480
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,016
I will enter my user
name, Shruti,


481
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,546
and my password, hello kitty.


482
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:34,956
So what it is doing right now,


483
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,346
it is enrolling this
Mac in the MDM.


484
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:40,036
It is going to fetch all the
configuration profiles ever


485
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:43,056
configured for this
Mac from my MDM server.


486
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:45,756
We are at the user account pane.


487
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:49,436
You will see we've populated
some of the information


488
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,516
from the previous login.


489
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:55,306
I'm going to go ahead and enter
my full name here, and let's see


490
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,046
if it likes my hello
kitty password.


491
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:01,856
Oh, looks like I need to use
a more secure password based


492
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,726
on the passcode policy
that we set earlier.


493
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:06,496
I will enter a new
password here.


494
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:11,016
What is cool about this is, it
gives you immediate feedback


495
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,456
as I'm entering the password.


496
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:16,826
I'm going to complete the
Password Verification field


497
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,016
and continue.


498
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:22,146
So it is creating the
user account as well


499
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:25,096
as the hidden administrator
account in the background.


500
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,546
I'm going to select the time
zone now, and you'll notice


501
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:29,926
that I didn't have
to go through any


502
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,776
of the location services pane
or the iCloud sign in pane


503
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:37,336
because we configured it to skip
all those Setup Assistant panes.


504
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:39,526
Here, our account is all set up.


505
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,946
Let's see what kind of
account really got created.


506
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,926
I will launch System
Preferences,


507
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:46,676
go to Users and Groups.


508
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,596
You can see it is a
standard user account.


509
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,396
The administrator
account is not visible.


510
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:56,706
Just to prove that administrator
account really got created,


511
00:24:56,876 --> 00:24:58,236
I'm going to unlock the pane


512
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,716
with my administrator
credentials


513
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:01,936
that I provided on
the MDM server.


514
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:05,396
Ta-da! You can see that
it's unlocked successfully.


515
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:09,586
The next thing I'm going to demo
is one of the coolest features,


516
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:11,876
and I'm sure many of you
have been waiting for,


517
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,726
being able to assign
VPP app to the devices


518
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:18,136
without requiring the user to
log in with their Apple ID.


519
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:25,986
So I'm going to push a VPP app
to this Mac, which is going


520
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,546
to be Apple Configurator app.


521
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:34,156
So while it pushes
the app, let's see,


522
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:37,136
check in the App Store
that I'm not signed in.


523
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:40,076
So we look at the Store menu.


524
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:41,766
You can see that I'm
not signed in here.


525
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,776
If you notice, the app
has already started


526
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,006
to install in the LaunchPad.


527
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:48,306
There is our Apple
Configurator app.


528
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:55,446
Thank you, back to Todd.


529
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:55,686
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: All right.


530
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:56,786
Thank you very much, Shruti.


531
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:58,826
So what did we just see?


532
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:01,886
Shruti installed a passcode
policy before the user account


533
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:03,696
was created, and it
was respected while


534
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:04,886
that user account was created.


535
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:06,766
It was a standard user account


536
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,426
that was created instead
of an admin account.


537
00:26:09,146 --> 00:26:12,576
She also created an admin
account that she could use


538
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:17,136
if she needed to log in directly
on the Mac or remotely later.


539
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:21,696
She also showed you assigning
a VPP app to a device.


540
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:26,886
So let's move on to the third
section of today's session


541
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:30,216
and talk about ongoing
management of devices.


542
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:33,276
First, I would like
to highlight the fact


543
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:36,976
that iOS 9 supports
Exchange ActiveSync 16,


544
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:38,996
specifically a number
of improvements


545
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:41,806
to calendar support,
including improved reliability


546
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:44,886
for a number of common tasks
and support for attachments


547
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:46,116
in physical locations.


548
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:51,836
Now let's turn to our own
MDM protocol and profiles.


549
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:54,216
There are a number of
new commands and queries,


550
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:57,866
and the ones I want to highlight
at the top, there's a new query


551
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,306
that tells you what software
updates are available


552
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:04,286
for that device and a command
that will tell the iOS device


553
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:08,306
to update to the latest
iOS for any devices in DEP.


554
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:12,546
[ Applause ]


555
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:14,576
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Including
being able to tell the devices


556
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:17,886
to download and stage the update
so you can then command them all


557
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,016
to update at the same time.


558
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:23,336
I've already talked about the
remaining commands and queries


559
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:27,016
in the enrollment section
and the distribution section.


560
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:28,536
So I won't spend any
more time on those.


561
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:32,196
Now let's turn to what's new
with configuration profiles.


562
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:35,616
There are two new payloads,
network usage rules,


563
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,426
which allows an organization


564
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:39,906
to control how their
managed apps use the network,


565
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:42,676
whether they're allowed
to use cell data or roam.


566
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:47,666
The OS X server account
payload configures whether apps


567
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,596
that support the document
provider API can access


568
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:52,516
documents on their
OS X server account.


569
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:54,716
There are a number of
other settings added


570
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,806
to existing payloads,
including a lot of changes


571
00:27:57,836 --> 00:28:02,106
in the IKEv2 VPN connection
type, more about that later,


572
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,036
and a large number
of new restrictions.


573
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:06,056
So let's look at those.


574
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,796
There are a handful
that are applicable


575
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:12,036
on unsupervised devices,
including the ability


576
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:14,746
to prevent users from trusting
additional enterprise app


577
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,296
authors that I mentioned
earlier.


578
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:21,946
We also now allow you to
tell AirDrop to be treated


579
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:23,796
as an unmanaged destination
[applause].


580
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:25,466
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: All right!


581
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,216
But the final thing I want


582
00:28:27,216 --> 00:28:30,546
to highlight here are
the three restrictions,


583
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,856
third from the bottom,
modify device name,


584
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:34,136
passcode, and wallpaper.


585
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:37,526
These are particularly useful
in shared device deployments.


586
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:40,026
If you have, say, some
might say creative,


587
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:43,506
others might say malicious,
students who like to mess


588
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:45,686
with their devices, you
can now prevent them


589
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:48,076
from changing the device
name, setting a passcode,


590
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:49,216
or changing the wallpaper.


591
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:53,606
[ Applause ]


592
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:54,836
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
One final note


593
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,996
about configuration profile
restrictions in iOS 9.


594
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:00,216
There are a number
of restrictions,


595
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:03,666
these nine in fact, created
before supervision existed.


596
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:07,566
And in fact, they really
should only be applicable


597
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:08,806
on supervised devices.


598
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:12,806
So this is your early warning
that they are still applicable


599
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:16,816
or they still are honored on
unsupervised devices in iOS 9,


600
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:19,016
but in an iOS version


601
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:21,206
to be named later they
will be only honored


602
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:22,476
on supervised devices.


603
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:25,006
Now let's turn to OS X.


604
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:31,016
Just like in iOS 9, OS X El
Capitan gives you a new query


605
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:33,376
that tells you what software
updates are available


606
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:36,336
for that Mac, and you can
tell it to install one or more


607
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:37,746
of those updates if the Mac is


608
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:43,846
in DEP. The device information
query achieves parity with iOS


609
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:47,076
and you can now obtain, if
you are using user assignments


610
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,426
for VPP managed distribution,
you can now see


611
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,456
which account is
configured on that device.


612
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:54,506
We already talked about
setup configuration


613
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:57,006
and device-configured commands
in the enrollment section.


614
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,806
There's also an active
managed users query,


615
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:04,206
which will tell the server
which users are logged in


616
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:07,246
and actively using the
Mac so you can clean


617
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:09,226
up obsolete unused sessions.


618
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:15,386
There are also some changes
to configuration profiles.


619
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:17,896
There's a new payload to
configure an Ethernet proxy


620
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,436
and a number of settings
for other payloads,


621
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:23,146
including a handful
of restrictions


622
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,296
that were previously
available on iOS


623
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:30,446
and now also are
available on OS X.


624
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:33,316
As I alluded to earlier, there
are a lot of changes in VPN


625
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:35,086
and enterprise network
connectivity.


626
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,966
I encourage you to come


627
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,676
and checkout their
session Friday morning


628
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:39,596
and learn all about that.


629
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,886
I will not steal
their thunder here.


630
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:46,276
That brings us to the end
of the management section.


631
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:48,146
I would like to ask
Shruti to show you some


632
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,386
of these features on iOS.


633
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:54,546
[ Applause ]


634
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:55,886
>> SHRUTI GUPTA:
Thank you, Todd.


635
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:56,646
Hello again.


636
00:30:56,886 --> 00:31:00,306
So I'm going to demo some of
the new features on iOS now.


637
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:05,036
So here is my device
that is running iOS 9.


638
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:09,216
It is already enrolled in DEP.
If you look at the settings,


639
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:12,206
you can see that I can currently
set a passcode on this device.


640
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:14,536
I can change the wallpaper.


641
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:18,936
And if I go to General,
About, Name,


642
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,466
you can see that I can
edit the device name too.


643
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:25,436
Let's go to restrict these
settings using our MDM server.


644
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:30,626
So the server is now sending the
push notification to the device.


645
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:33,746
Keep your eyes on the screen
as the settings get updated.


646
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:35,936
There you go, you can see


647
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:38,736
that I can no longer set
a passcode on this device.


648
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:40,636
I cannot change the wallpaper.


649
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:42,806
If I try to tap on
the Name field,


650
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:44,756
I cannot change the
device name either.


651
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:48,986
Earlier we saw VPP
app assignment on Mac.


652
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:53,736
Now we are going to see VPP app
assignment on the iOS device.


653
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:58,256
I am going to push a
VPP app to this device,


654
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:01,166
which is going to be WWDC app.


655
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,686
Let's confirm I'm not signed


656
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:05,826
into the App Store here
while it's pushing the app


657
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:06,566
from the server.


658
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:08,476
I go to App Store Settings,


659
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:11,016
you can see that I'm not
signed in with my Apple ID.


660
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:15,076
If you go to the Home
screen, you'll notice


661
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,746
that App Store does
not exist there.


662
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:19,176
That is because I
restricted the App Store


663
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:20,846
from installing apps
on this device.


664
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,696
>> SHRUTI GUPTA: I guess
I'll give it back to Todd.


665
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:24,606
Thank you.


666
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:28,546
[ Applause ]


667
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:29,696
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
Thank you, Shruti.


668
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,666
You trust us, right?


669
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:32,446
It works great.


670
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:33,846
All right.


671
00:32:34,156 --> 00:32:35,966
So what did Shruti
just show you?


672
00:32:35,966 --> 00:32:38,716
Again taking advantage of
the three new restrictions


673
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,666
to prevent students and
others from changing things


674
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,406
on the device that you
don't want them to change,


675
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:47,766
and being able to assign apps
to devices and install apps


676
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,126
on devices even when the
App Store is disabled.


677
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,776
So let's turn to
our fourth section


678
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:55,616
and talk a few minutes
about tools.


679
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:59,156
The first tools that
I want to highlight,


680
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,776
I hope that you MDM
develops are aware of.


681
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,396
If not, this is your moment.


682
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:05,946
We created over the
past year simulators


683
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:07,686
for both the Device
Enrollment Program


684
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,146
and the Volume Purchase Program.


685
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,406
It allows you to
simulate large numbers


686
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,786
of devices hitting
your server as well


687
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:16,496
as all the service errors that
may be difficult to simulate


688
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,766
in any other way and
test your handling


689
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:19,806
to make sure it's robust.


690
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,506
Both simulators are
available for download


691
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:23,706
on the Developer portal,


692
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,686
and we've released
new versions this week


693
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:26,996
that support all
the new features


694
00:33:26,996 --> 00:33:27,976
that we talked about today.


695
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,186
Please, download and
use them to make sure


696
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:35,226
that your implementations
are as robust as they can be.


697
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,806
We use them to test our own
device management tools.


698
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,556
For example, Profile
Manager, which, of course,


699
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,596
has been updated to support
all these new features.


700
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:48,376
Shruti showed you its support
for several of them today.


701
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,346
Apple Configurator plays a role


702
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:54,296
in automated enrollment using
the Device Enrollment Program.


703
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:57,636
I want to talk about
Configurator.


704
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,746
Here is Configurator.


705
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:01,986
Has the three workflows.


706
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:04,836
Prepare, you can configure
how the devices are prepared


707
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:06,636
and supervised, and assign them.


708
00:34:07,196 --> 00:34:10,956
It was initially the only
way to supervise devices.


709
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,676
You can install VPP apps
using redemption codes.


710
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,866
You can install profiles.


711
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:17,446
It maintains and
builds up a database


712
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:20,496
as you supervise
devices, and import apps


713
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:22,606
from iTunes, and
create profiles.


714
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:26,505
We received feedback
over the last three years


715
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,585
and learned a lot about
managing iOS devices


716
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,795
over the last seven years.


717
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,616
I am thrilled to tell you we
have completely reinvented Apple


718
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:38,656
Configurator and created
Apple Configurator 2.


719
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:43,545
[ Applause ]


720
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:44,826
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: So
what were our goals


721
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:46,775
in creating Apple
Configurator 2?


722
00:34:47,956 --> 00:34:50,235
We wanted to invert
the user experience


723
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:52,096
and put your devices
front and center.


724
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:54,496
That's what you are looking at
in your cart or on your desk,


725
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:57,106
and show you the state
your devices are in,


726
00:34:57,106 --> 00:34:59,316
which makes it easier for you
to understand what you can do


727
00:34:59,316 --> 00:35:00,536
with them and what
is going to happen.


728
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,316
We've broken apart the workflows
and given you discrete tasks


729
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,596
so you can perform
exactly what you need to do


730
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,556
on a specific group
of devices right now.


731
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:13,286
While at the same time
making it very easy


732
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:16,986
to combine those discrete
tasks into custom workflows


733
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:18,486
to prepare your devices


734
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:21,436
and manage them just the
way you want [applause].


735
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,576
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: We
also heard that many


736
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:28,486
of you are using multiple
Configurator stations,


737
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:30,536
some even hundreds in a
large school district.


738
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:34,326
You want to better be able to
share data between the stations


739
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:36,196
and freely move devices
between them.


740
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:41,096
We also of course want Apple
Configurator to be a great tool


741
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:42,766
for managing a small
number of devices


742
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,616
in a classroom, or
a cart, or a lab.


743
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,126
But we also want it to
be a great companion


744
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:49,826
to the Device Enrollment
Program and an MDM server,


745
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:51,776
which is doing the bulk
of the remote management.


746
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:53,726
But you might want to
use Apple Configurator


747
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:56,236
for a few tasks here and there.


748
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:58,146
Instead of me talking
about it anymore,


749
00:35:58,146 --> 00:35:59,686
I would like to invite
Enrique Osuna


750
00:35:59,836 --> 00:36:02,096
to show you Apple
Configurator 2.


751
00:36:03,516 --> 00:36:08,546
[ Applause ]


752
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:09,976
>> ENRIQUE OSUNA: Thanks, Todd.


753
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:11,356
I'm excited to be
here to talk to you


754
00:36:11,356 --> 00:36:12,486
about Apple Configurator 2.


755
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,576
Why don't we go ahead
and get started.


756
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:17,536
The first thing you'll see


757
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,186
when you launch Apple
Configurator is the


758
00:36:19,186 --> 00:36:20,076
Devices window.


759
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,566
This Devices window has all
of your connected devices.


760
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,726
Each of the connected devices
are represented by this icon.


761
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:28,936
These particular
icons have an image


762
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,026
of the device's Home screen.


763
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:31,546
This is Configurator's way


764
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:33,926
to tell you these devices
have been prepared.


765
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:37,826
Everywhere in Configurator where
you see a collection of icons,


766
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:40,286
you can also view the
same data as a list.


767
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,766
You can get there by
clicking on the View button


768
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:45,356
in the toolbar and
clicking on List.


769
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,806
Here, you see the
same connected devices


770
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:50,666
with additional information.


771
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:54,796
To go back to the collection of
icons, click on the View button,


772
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,776
and back to Collection.


773
00:36:58,036 --> 00:37:00,786
One of the key features that
Todd mentioned was the ability


774
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:03,616
to perform discrete tasks
on connected devices.


775
00:37:04,386 --> 00:37:06,446
These tasks are found
in the Actions menu.


776
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:10,796
In the Actions menu you can
do things like add, remove,


777
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:15,026
modify existing content as well
as back up and prepare devices.


778
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:17,716
We will talk more about
prepare in a second.


779
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,926
In the Devices window you
see a big toolbar at the top.


780
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:24,996
The toolbar has all of the
common actions of Configurator,


781
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,766
such as the Update button here.


782
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,796
In the upper right-hand corner


783
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:32,436
of these connected devices
you see this big red badge.


784
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:34,806
What this red badge indicates is


785
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:36,296
that these devices
require an update.


786
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:39,326
I'll go ahead and see what
updates are available.


787
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,686
Let me select all my devices.


788
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:44,836
Click on the Update
button in the toolbar.


789
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:48,876
Now what Configurator is doing
is contacting the iTunes Store,


790
00:37:49,886 --> 00:37:52,816
figuring out if there's
any iOS or app updates.


791
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:55,326
Now, you can see that
Configurator has identified


792
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:58,576
that the WWDC app on my
devices need an update.


793
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,526
So I can update that app by
clicking the Update button.


794
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:07,806
Configurator is contacting the
Store, downloading the apps,


795
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:09,576
and actually installing
them onto the devices.


796
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:13,416
For those who didn't notice,
I didn't have to launch iTunes


797
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,646
in this entire transaction.


798
00:38:15,516 --> 00:38:19,796
[ Cheers & Applause ]


799
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:22,696
>> ENRIQUE OSUNA: Configurator
no longer has a database of apps


800
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,296
that you have to
manage or maintain.


801
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:28,206
Now, as Configurator is
finishing up the app install,


802
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:30,876
you'll notice the big
red badge that was


803
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,546
in the upper right-hand corner
should start disappearing


804
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:34,126
here shortly.


805
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:37,666
This is an indicator that
these devices no longer require


806
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:37,956
an update.


807
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:48,506
Now, right before
this presentation,


808
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,986
I was actually having some
problems on one of my pads.


809
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:54,106
It was probably that one, trying
to get on to the WiFi network.


810
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:57,296
Let's look at what
might be going on.


811
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,636
If I double-click on
one of these devices,


812
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:03,396
Configurator launches you into
this new UI that allows you


813
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,126
to see some information
about your device.


814
00:39:05,606 --> 00:39:08,816
You can find things like the
device's name, serial number,


815
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:10,916
as well as organization
information.


816
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:14,156
In the left sidebar,
you can find apps.


817
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:16,266
These are the apps
actually installed


818
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,896
on my device, as
well as profiles.


819
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:22,156
These are the profiles that
are installed on my device.


820
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:25,596
Unfortunately, this device
is missing my WiFi profile.


821
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:28,116
I'm sure I have other
devices in my cart


822
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,116
that are missing
a profile as well.


823
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:32,276
Let's go ahead and see if
we can't figure it out.


824
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:35,416
I can go back to all
my devices by clicking


825
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,716
on the Back button
in the toolbar.


826
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:39,166
Here are my connected devices.


827
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,216
If I go to the Search field
in the upper right-hand corner


828
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:44,836
and start typing WiFi,


829
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:50,716
Configurator offers me
this fancy suggestion


830
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:54,306
of all the devices that have
the WiFi profile installed.


831
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:56,746
The problem that I have is not


832
00:39:56,746 --> 00:39:58,786
which devices have the
profile already installed.


833
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,126
It's the devices that don't
have the profile installed.


834
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:03,466
If I click on the token
in the Search field


835
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:06,196
and it says profile
is not installed,


836
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,996
Configurator will show me the
two pads missing the profile.


837
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:11,886
Let me fix the problem.


838
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:15,896
I'll select both devices,
click on the Add button


839
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:18,516
in the toolbar, and
click on Profiles.


840
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:23,546
Configurator 2 no longer
has a database of profiles.


841
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,426
These profiles can be found
anywhere on your disk.


842
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,536
Let's navigate to the desktop.


843
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:30,846
Here I have my WiFi profile.


844
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:35,876
What is neat, you can have these
profiles on mounted volumes


845
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,166
and even in your iCloud drive.


846
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:41,846
Now that Configurator is done,
I can clear the Search field


847
00:40:42,236 --> 00:40:43,796
and I can see my
connected devices again.


848
00:40:44,256 --> 00:40:46,186
Another cool feature


849
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:49,166
of Configurator 2 is the
ability to tag a device.


850
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:53,286
Tagging a device allows you to
create device groups, but again,


851
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,096
without a database of devices.


852
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:56,796
I can show you that right now.


853
00:40:57,326 --> 00:41:01,006
If I select a couple of these
devices, go to the toolbar,


854
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:04,726
and click on the Tag button
and select a few of these tags.


855
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,376
Press the Return key.


856
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:09,676
What Configurator
is doing is writing


857
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:10,966
that tag to these devices.


858
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:13,096
What is neat about the tags,


859
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,606
it is actually written
to the device.


860
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,696
When you transport this device
to another Configurator station,


861
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:20,836
those same tags appear
there as well.


862
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,126
If I go back to the
same Search field


863
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:26,626
in the upper right-hand corner
and start looking for my tag,


864
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:30,166
I start getting a
suggestion, fourth grade,


865
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,436
I'm going to go ahead
and click on that.


866
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,636
Now Configurator is
showing me just the pads


867
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:37,416
that are tagged with
fourth grade.


868
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:39,976
Right under the Search field --


869
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:43,696
[ Applause ]


870
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:45,236
>> ENRIQUE OSUNA:
Under the Search field,


871
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,156
there's a Save button.


872
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:50,246
Configurator allows me to save
this search for later use.


873
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:52,336
Let me click on the Save button.


874
00:41:53,026 --> 00:41:55,456
You'll notice a new entry in
the favorites bar right here.


875
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,326
Now, whenever I add
another device


876
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:01,216
that has the fourth grade tag
attached to it, it will appear


877
00:42:01,216 --> 00:42:02,056
in this particular view.


878
00:42:03,566 --> 00:42:06,946
So one last thing that I want
to do is rename my devices.


879
00:42:07,106 --> 00:42:09,996
Let's go back to all devices
right here in the favorites bar.


880
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:13,176
And let me select
all of my devices.


881
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:17,206
Go to the Actions menu.


882
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:19,316
Modify. Device name.


883
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:21,126
Like Configurator 1,


884
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:23,806
Configurator 2 can
rename your devices.


885
00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:27,866
We offer you an opportunity
to provide static text.


886
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,826
Let me go ahead and give
it some static text.


887
00:42:31,946 --> 00:42:34,736
And in Configurator 1,
we introduced a feature


888
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,886
that allowed you to append
an autoincrementing number


889
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:38,756
to the field.


890
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:41,716
In Configurator 2, we kind
of let you do that too,


891
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:44,946
but we do that through what
we like to call a token.


892
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:49,306
These tokens can be put
anywhere in the name.


893
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:52,056
Here you see the
autoincrementing number.


894
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,766
You see other information
about the device,


895
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:59,446
like the device's serial
number, type, and capacity.


896
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:02,316
For this demonstration,
I like to use type


897
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:05,046
and the autoincrementing number.


898
00:43:06,396 --> 00:43:07,456
Now I click on Rename.


899
00:43:07,936 --> 00:43:11,316
Configurator is now going
through all these devices,


900
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:14,326
grabbing those bits of
information off the devic,


901
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:17,226
and creating a name and putting
it back on to the device.


902
00:43:17,656 --> 00:43:21,126
As you can see, my devices are
named Townships Schools iPad 1


903
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:23,336
through 5.


904
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:24,646
All these devices
are configured.


905
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:31,226
I have a brand-new cart of
devices I would like to add.


906
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:35,106
These are pads that are right
out of the box and almost ready


907
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:36,806
to go as soon as
Configurator is done with them.


908
00:43:37,436 --> 00:43:39,926
The first thing that you'll
notice is this big white Device


909
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:42,606
icon, what that represents is


910
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:44,656
that these devices are
ready to be prepared.


911
00:43:44,716 --> 00:43:47,226
I would like to show you
that prepare right now.


912
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,436
Let me click on one
of these devices.


913
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:52,686
Click on the Prepare
button in the toolbar.


914
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,876
In Configurator 2, there's
two prepare workflows.


915
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:59,166
One is manual, and the other
is the automated enrollment


916
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,656
that Todd talked about
earlier in the presentation.


917
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:04,056
For this demonstration,


918
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:07,416
I'm going to do these
iPads using manual.


919
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:08,646
I'll click on Next.


920
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:10,916
Here is my opportunity


921
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:13,166
to manually enroll
the devices into MDM.


922
00:44:13,596 --> 00:44:15,306
I don't have an MDM
server with me today,


923
00:44:15,306 --> 00:44:16,636
so I will go ahead
and click on Next.


924
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,626
Here, Configurator is
asking me if I want


925
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:21,676
to supervise my devices
to my organization,


926
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:23,706
and I absolutely do
to take advantage


927
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:26,126
of the new iOS 9
supervise only features.


928
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:27,386
Click on Next.


929
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:31,656
This is the organization that is
associated with the supervision.


930
00:44:32,226 --> 00:44:32,806
This looks good.


931
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:37,436
Next. And this final
pane is my opportunity


932
00:44:37,436 --> 00:44:39,716
of skipping iOS Setup
Assistant panes


933
00:44:39,986 --> 00:44:42,426
on the device once I hand
my device back to my users.


934
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:46,676
For this demonstration, I want
to not show any of the panes.


935
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:48,456
I'll go ahead and
click on Prepare.


936
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:51,526
Configurator is now preparing
and supervising these devices.


937
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:55,196
I still have to tag, add some
profiles, and add some apps


938
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:59,106
to this device, which
actually is a lengthy process.


939
00:44:59,526 --> 00:45:02,426
So, what we did in Configurator
2 is automated this process


940
00:45:02,426 --> 00:45:04,186
with what we call blueprints.


941
00:45:04,516 --> 00:45:06,086
I'll show you what a
blueprint is right now.


942
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:08,846
If I click on the Apply
button in the toolbar,


943
00:45:08,846 --> 00:45:11,816
and click on Edit Blueprints,
Configurator takes you


944
00:45:11,816 --> 00:45:14,576
into this special mode where
you can create a new blueprint,


945
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:16,296
and I'm going to do that.


946
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:17,866
Click New Blueprint.


947
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:19,966
Let me give it a
name I can remember.


948
00:45:26,016 --> 00:45:27,036
And press Return.


949
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:30,196
Now, what's really cool
about these blueprints is


950
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:31,796
that they act just
like a device.


951
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:34,706
Anything that I can do
on a connected device,


952
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:36,106
I can actually do
on a blueprint.


953
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:39,786
What the blueprint does,
it records those actions,


954
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,866
and then later on I can
replay those actions.


955
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:44,776
Let me do the first
thing, which is prepare.


956
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:46,286
If I click on the blueprint,


957
00:45:46,986 --> 00:45:48,746
I press on the Prepare
button in the toolbar.


958
00:45:49,536 --> 00:45:52,156
Configurator offers me the
same view we had earlier


959
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:53,406
when we clicked Prepare.


960
00:45:53,556 --> 00:45:55,426
Configurator remembered
my last options.


961
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:57,816
And these options are fine.


962
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:00,606
I am breeze through
these setup panes.


963
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,326
Click on Next.


964
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,336
Until we get to prepare.


965
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:09,346
Now that the blueprint
is prepared,


966
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,086
I want to add some tags.


967
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,926
Click on the Tag
button in the toolbar.


968
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,136
Select a couple of tags.


969
00:46:16,796 --> 00:46:17,356
Press Return.


970
00:46:18,136 --> 00:46:21,166
You will immediately notice
the Blueprints label is updated


971
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,236
with my new tags.


972
00:46:23,996 --> 00:46:25,276
I want to add an app.


973
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,856
Click the add button
in the toolbar.


974
00:46:28,816 --> 00:46:33,276
Apps. Now what you see here
is all the VPP apps associated


975
00:46:33,276 --> 00:46:34,416
with my VPP account.


976
00:46:34,906 --> 00:46:37,866
I want to go ahead
and push the WWDC app


977
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:39,906
to a part of this blueprint.


978
00:46:39,906 --> 00:46:46,076
I click on WWDC, Add Apps,
and then finally I want


979
00:46:46,076 --> 00:46:47,296
to add my WiFi profile.


980
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,136
The same Add button, Profiles,


981
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:54,416
Configurator remembered the
last spot I was at for profile.


982
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:58,236
I'll click on my WiFi profile.


983
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:01,066
Add profiles.


984
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:02,326
Now, like inspecting the device,


985
00:47:02,326 --> 00:47:03,566
you can also inspect
a blueprint.


986
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:06,476
If I double-click on this
blueprint, I'm presented


987
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:08,526
with this blueprint inspector.


988
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:11,566
Here you can see additional
information about the blueprint


989
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:15,296
such as its name, its
storage requirements,


990
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,086
here with the storage bar at
the top of this inspector,


991
00:47:19,486 --> 00:47:22,056
as well as the prepare
options I highlighted earlier


992
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:23,726
and the tags that I've set.


993
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:28,096
Like a device inspector, you can
also inspect the apps associated


994
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:31,196
with this blueprint and
the profiles associated


995
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:31,766
with this blueprint.


996
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:34,226
Now I'm almost done.


997
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,006
I just need to rename
the devices associated


998
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:37,586
with this blueprint.


999
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:38,606
So I go back to Info.


1000
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:41,206
Click on Actions.


1001
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:45,336
Modify. Device Name.


1002
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,466
Configurator remembered
my last rename options.


1003
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:51,266
Those worked fine, so
I'll click on Rename.


1004
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:55,526
You notice here in the blueprint
the device name options show


1005
00:47:55,526 --> 00:47:55,896
up here.


1006
00:47:56,616 --> 00:47:57,626
Great, this blueprint is done.


1007
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,816
In the lower right-hand corner,
I can click on the Done button.


1008
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:05,786
Now I want to apply that
blueprint to these devices


1009
00:48:05,786 --> 00:48:07,036
that are ready to be prepared.


1010
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:08,516
Let me select those devices.


1011
00:48:10,126 --> 00:48:12,756
Go back to that same Apply
button that we went to earlier.


1012
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:15,176
Now you see an entry
for my blueprint.


1013
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,906
If I tap on that entry,
Configurator is now going


1014
00:48:18,906 --> 00:48:21,006
through the actions I
saved in that blueprint


1015
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,736
and replaying them
on to the devices.


1016
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,766
This is Apple Configurator 2.


1017
00:48:25,056 --> 00:48:25,806
Thank you very much.


1018
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:26,926
Back to Todd.


1019
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:34,546
[ Applause ]


1020
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:35,956
>> TODD FERNANDEZ: Thank
you very much, Enrique.


1021
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,516
So Enrique has showed you how


1022
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,656
to configure devices using
Apple Configurator 2,


1023
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,676
including installing VPP apps.


1024
00:48:43,376 --> 00:48:44,866
I'll talk more about
that in a moment.


1025
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:48,006
You can create device tags
that travel with the devices


1026
00:48:48,006 --> 00:48:50,646
between multiple Configurator
stations using tags.


1027
00:48:51,516 --> 00:48:54,856
He showed you how to
build and use a blueprint


1028
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:59,046
to create a custom workflow
and replay the set of actions


1029
00:48:59,176 --> 00:49:03,966
that you want on any
number of further devices.


1030
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:05,506
However, there's even
more automation options


1031
00:49:05,506 --> 00:49:06,556
that we didn't show you here.


1032
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:08,846
In addition to blueprints
in the UI,


1033
00:49:09,486 --> 00:49:10,936
there's also a command-line
tool.


1034
00:49:11,396 --> 00:49:14,196
There's a scripting library
and suite of automation actions


1035
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:17,156
for you to easily integrate
Configurator's functionality


1036
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:17,976
into your workflows.


1037

[ Applause ]


1038
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:22,666
>> TODD FERNANDEZ:
You're in for a treat


1039
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:25,106
because Sal Soghoian is
going to talk about that


1040
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:27,156
on Thursday afternoon,
how to use Automator


1041
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:28,326
and Configurator together


1042
00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:30,386
to automate your device
management workflows.


1043
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:34,416
Enrique showed you a lot of
what Apple Configurator 2 can do


1044
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:35,426
but there's more.


1045
00:49:36,636 --> 00:49:40,926
I mentioned multiple station
support, all of those profiles


1046
00:49:40,926 --> 00:49:44,246
that you can find anywhere on
your Mac can be saved in iCloud


1047
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:46,496
in addition to other
Configurator settings.


1048
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:48,836
I mentioned the automation
tools.


1049
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:52,476
While Enrique showed you the
cool additions to renaming


1050
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:54,396
that Apple Configurator 2 has,


1051
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:56,366
there are also some great
enhancements to being able


1052
00:49:56,366 --> 00:49:58,866
to set wallpaper, which
is no longer a preference,


1053
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:01,326
but can be done as a command
on any number of devices.


1054
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,776
There are cool tricks
if you look


1055
00:50:03,776 --> 00:50:04,976
at the options in there as well.


1056
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:07,566
Definitely check it out.


1057
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:10,906
We released the beta yesterday,
and it's available for you


1058
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:12,436
to download from
the Developer portal


1059
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:13,946
and we will also
have it in the Lab.


1060
00:50:14,526 --> 00:50:17,906
That brings us to the end
of our fourth section.


1061
00:50:19,636 --> 00:50:22,116
And I just want to sum up
quickly for you administrators


1062
00:50:22,276 --> 00:50:24,476
that if you are using
wireless remote management,


1063
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:25,906
use the Device Enrollment
Program


1064
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:28,456
or Configurator using
automated enrollment


1065
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:31,666
to get your devices enrolled
in MDM or use Configurator


1066
00:50:31,776 --> 00:50:34,306
to manage your devices if
you are not going to use MDM.


1067
00:50:35,236 --> 00:50:37,716
You can use VPP managed
distribution now not only


1068
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:40,926
to distribute apps to
users but also to devices.


1069
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:44,346
As I mentioned the Configurator
2 beta is available now.


1070
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:48,236
Turning to developers,
again, you app developers,


1071
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:51,276
please early next month in
iTunes Connect you will be able


1072
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:53,346
to opt in to device
assignments for your apps.


1073
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:57,776
MDM developers, please support
VPP managed distribution device


1074
00:50:57,776 --> 00:50:59,766
assignments, your customers
will appreciate that.


1075
00:51:00,406 --> 00:51:01,936
The documentation
is available now,


1076
00:51:02,366 --> 00:51:05,736
and the new iTunes Store APIs
that I mentioned and talked


1077
00:51:05,736 --> 00:51:06,756
to you about are already


1078
00:51:06,756 --> 00:51:08,586
in production, ready
for you to use.


1079
00:51:10,056 --> 00:51:12,676
Support all the other
new features in iOS 9


1080
00:51:12,676 --> 00:51:17,356
and OS X El Capitan, and use
the DEP and VPP simulators


1081
00:51:17,486 --> 00:51:18,846
to test your implementation.


1082
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:24,506
There are related sessions
this week about CloudKit,


1083
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:28,346
there's an enterprise
get-together later tonight.


1084
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:31,946
The VPN session on Friday and
Sal's session on Thursday.


1085
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:33,236
Check them out.


1086
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:35,876
There's a great website with
lots of resources for how


1087
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,286
to integrate Apple devices
into your enterprise.


1088
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:42,636
Lots of documentation
for MDM developers,


1089
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:45,506
from the MDM protocol to the
configuration profile reference,


1090
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:47,816
and a forum where you can
ask and answer questions.


1091
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,286
Administrators, there's
lots of reference guides


1092
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:56,226
for deploying iOS and OS X
in your organizations as well


1093
00:51:56,406 --> 00:52:01,036
as help for our tools and forums
to ask and answer questions


1094
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:03,966
about how to bring Apple
devices into your organizations.


1095
00:52:04,636 --> 00:52:08,216
Thank you for your attention
and wish you have a great show.


1096
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:09,216
Thank you very much.
