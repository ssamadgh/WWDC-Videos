00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:12,226
>> Good afternoon.


2
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:15,186
I'm John Cavanaugh,
and I manage the group


3
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:17,576
that creates the
documentation for all


4
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:19,606
of Apple's consumer
and Pro products.


5
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,296
And here's some of what we do.


6
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:29,236
Print pieces that come in
the box, iBooks and PDFs,


7
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:32,706
help topics that appear
in the OS X Help Viewer.


8
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:36,816
We have some highly
contextual In-App solutions


9
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:41,416
and deliverables on the web
like these iOS user guides


10
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:45,346
or this What's New
Experience you may have seen


11
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:47,966
in OS X Mavericks.


12
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:53,476
Now, creating great customer
documentation isn't always seen


13
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:56,986
as one of the most exciting
parts of software development -


14
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:59,616
I realize that as the
documentation guy.


15
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:04,286
And it can often be treated as
an afterthought by developers.


16
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,756
Not the developers in
this room of course,


17
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:08,436
but let's just say
some developers.


18
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:14,676
And when that's the case, it can
often take the form of an FAQ


19
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:18,316
or help system where
basically you wait


20
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:22,866
until a person gets stuck, drop
them into a comprehensive body


21
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,946
of content and then have
them fend for themselves


22
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:27,206
to try to get answers.


23
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:32,326
And historically, icons
like this have been used


24
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,136
to represent the experience,


25
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,726
which really isn't the
most flattering image


26
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:44,096
to have associated with your app
or game, unless of course it's


27
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:49,866
about rescuing people
lost at sea, I don't know.


28
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:54,206
Now, this Get answers
strategy, it does have its place


29
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:59,136
in help systems for deeper
apps, but as iOS developers,


30
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,286
you probably don't
even have to go here.


31
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,476
Instead, Rachel is
going to show you how


32
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:10,735
to anticipate users' needs in a
seamless onboarding experience


33
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,006
so they won't even feel like
they're getting your help.


34
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:16,066
They'll just feel as though
they're experiencing your


35
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,356
amazing app or game.


36
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:22,136
She's also going to show you
how to extend the strategy


37
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:25,346
into an area we like to
call Inform & Inspire,


38
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:30,326
and that gives you the
opportunity to delight users


39
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,676
by showing them what's possible.


40
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:38,066
Now as I've said, there's
great ways to do this and not


41
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,146
so great ways, and that's what
Rachel is going to show you now.


42
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:42,306
Rachel.


43
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,536
[ Applause ]


44
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:46,536
>> Thanks, John.


45
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:48,156
Hi, everyone.


46
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,946
My name is Rachel
Roth and I'm one


47
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:53,596
of Apple's user experience
evangelists.


48
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,566
So today, we're going to talk


49
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:59,516
about onboarding and
welcoming people.


50
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,946
Now, this term onboarding,


51
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:05,336
you may have heard it called
the new user experience


52
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:09,856
or the first use
experience or what happens


53
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,306
in a tutorial for a game.


54
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:15,336
And really, onboarding is a term
that's traditionally associated


55
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:17,476
with what happens with employees


56
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:18,886
when they first started
a company.


57
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:22,306
It's how people acquire the
knowledge and the skills


58
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:25,436
and behaviors to become
successful at their job.


59
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:29,946
Now, when it comes to an app or
a game, people are going to go


60
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:32,026
through a similar
sort of experience.


61
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,966
They need to figure out, you
know, how does the UI work,


62
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:38,296
how's the game played,
is this app really going


63
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,186
to be right for me?


64
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:43,186
And that's why you
want to welcome them.


65
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,816
It's so important that their
first experience is a good one


66
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,976
because otherwise it's going
to be their last experience,


67
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,866
because we've got a
million other competitors


68
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,086
in the App Store, literally.


69
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,766
So people aren't going to stick


70
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:58,756
around if the first
experience isn't really great.


71
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:05,106
Now, when you step into a store,
there's - like a physical store


72
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,456
in real life, there's a number
of things that are going


73
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,676
to influence whether
or not you stick around


74
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,606
or whether you turn
around and walk out.


75
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:13,876
You know, is the layout


76
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:16,676
of the store intimidating
or is it inviting?


77
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,986
You know, is the staff rude?


78
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,926
Is the staff really
aggressively pushy?


79
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:25,816
Those things could turn you
off and make you walk away.


80
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:30,066
But if the staff is inviting and
the environment is comfortable,


81
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,396
well, you might stick around,
explore the merchandise.


82
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:39,096
So the best approach with
apps or games is that you want


83
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:42,196
to get people in and using
them as quickly as possible.


84
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:45,146
You just want to let
people jump right in,


85
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:48,966
and sometimes that's
not always possible.


86
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:53,576
Now, there are a number of
reasons for having onboarding


87
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:58,746
and having a confusing or poorly
executed UI is not one of them.


88
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:04,016
So you want to make sure if
your UI isn't intuitive and easy


89
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,336
to use, spend time
refining that UI,


90
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:10,066
not building an onboarding
sequence, OK?


91
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:14,026
Now, if you have
registration required


92
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,936
to use your application,
that's a different story.


93
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,056
Or with games.


94
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:25,946
You might need to explain
the backstory or the rules,


95
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,536
you know, how games are played.


96
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:31,426
Or if your UI is heavily
reliant on gestures,


97
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,826
that might warrant a
little bit of information


98
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:34,966
in order to get started.


99
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,776
So let's talk briefly
about if you have


100
00:05:38,776 --> 00:05:40,186
to require registration.


101
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:44,416
Sometimes, it is absolutely
necessary to see anything,


102
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:50,396
like a banking application or
social networks or bill pay,


103
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:53,536
anything that has personal
information, then you're going


104
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,886
to need to let people
know what's going on.


105
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:02,586
But before, if there's any way
possible, you want to delay


106
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:05,536
that registration until
it's absolutely necessary.


107
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:09,666
Now, the iTunes store is
a great example of this.


108
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:13,476
You can browse and look at
all the books and the music


109
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:16,426
and the movies that you want,
and it's only when you go


110
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:20,746
to buy something that you need
to authenticate or register.


111
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,696
So this means there's
nothing standing in the way


112
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,186
of finding something you love.


113
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,886
Requiring people to register
before they can see anything


114
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,936
puts this unnecessary
obstacle in their way.


115
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,826
They have to trust that it's
going to be worth their while


116
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,406
to go through that obstacle.


117
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:40,256
Here is a better way,
this is "JUKELY,"


118
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,796
and it's a concert-finding app.


119
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:43,906
They've got a great design.


120
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:47,356
They'll help you find
concerts that are local to you,


121
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:50,666
tailored to your taste - they
will even find someone to go


122
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,726
to the concert with you.


123
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:55,596
Now, not only do they have a
very short onboarding sequence,


124
00:06:55,736 --> 00:07:00,046
but they will let you browse
without registering at all.


125
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:04,586
You just tap that "skip this
for now" text at the bottom,


126
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,426
and you can go right inside


127
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,336
and explore what the
app is all about.


128
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:12,126
You can look at the concert
listings, read about bands,


129
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,476
and it's only when you
express interest in something


130
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,306
or you want to buy some tickets,
well, that's when they have -


131
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:21,616
they ask you to sign
up, and that's great.


132
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:25,386
This approach lets you see
what that app is all about.


133
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,896
You can explore everything,
all the concerts in your area,


134
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,686
and you only have to
register when you're ready


135
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:33,046
to take action on something.


136
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:36,576
People are going to
be much more motivated


137
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:38,916
and quite frankly
comfortable going


138
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,906
through that registration
process if they're confident


139
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,426
in the quality and the utility


140
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,486
of what your app
is offering them.


141
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,966
Now, when it's time
to have people go


142
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,266
through that registration,


143
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:55,646
you want to explain why you're
asking them to register.


144
00:07:56,216 --> 00:08:00,596
So think about it this way,
let's say a stranger walked


145
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,936
up to you in front of
Moscone and said, "Hey,


146
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,396
can I have your email
address and phone number?"


147
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,466
You wouldn't give
it to him, right?


148
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,086
That's just creepy, and you
have no idea what's going


149
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,696
to happen with that data.


150
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:16,666
Now, that's exactly what
you're doing if you ask people


151
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,646
to register but you're
not telling them why,


152
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:20,566
and they don't know
anything about you.


153
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:26,596
It's especially important in
cases where you have to register


154
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:30,696
in order to use an app
because your description


155
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,876
in the App Store,
or word of mouth,


156
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,376
or brand awareness isn't enough


157
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:38,076
to make people feel
comfortable giving you all


158
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,566
of their personal information.


159
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:43,846
You need to make it really clear
what you're going to do with it.


160
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:48,126
So this is "Jelly" and they
crowdsource the answers


161
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:50,146
to questions from
your social network.


162
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,586
So they have a real challenge -


163
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:54,406
there really is nothing
they can show you


164
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:56,206
without you registering
and signing in.


165
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:59,476
So that's why they've given
you this brief explanation


166
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:00,996
of what the service is about


167
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,936
and explain why they
need your information.


168
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:07,816
And very importantly, they let
you know that they're not going


169
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:09,656
to post anything automatically.


170
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:14,876
And this is very important
because when you're dealing


171
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,246
with people's personal
information,


172
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:18,026
you want to make sure


173
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:19,776
that they're comfortable
giving it to you.


174
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:23,016
They want to know that you're
going to protect their privacy.


175
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:28,236
And transparency around privacy
is particularly important


176
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,476
if you're dealing with
social network integration


177
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:33,016
because I'm sure we've
all had that friend


178
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:36,656
that he's got some app that's
going crazy on their timeline


179
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,806
and you're thinking, "Oh
what a noob," you know,


180
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,086
nobody checked their settings,


181
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:41,296
they didn't know
what they were doing.


182
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:44,786
And nowhere is this more
the case when you're dealing


183
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,166
with dating applications,


184
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,926
because that would
be a nightmare.


185
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,996
All of a sudden, all your
friends and your family


186
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:55,126
and some people that you kind of
know from work or met some time


187
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,376
in a bar could see who you
liked and who you didn't like.


188
00:09:59,096 --> 00:09:59,936
Nobody wants that.


189
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:04,756
So "Tinder" here is a very
popular dating application


190
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:09,396
and they're very explicit: They
are never going to post anything


191
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,936
to Facebook on your behalf.


192
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:14,426
And this is hugely
important because the way that


193
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:16,926
"Tinder" works is
they're asking you if you


194
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,876
like people based
on their picture.


195
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:21,586
So if you have any doubts at all


196
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:23,286
or you're feeling
a little hesitant,


197
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,236
you can tap that i button,


198
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,236
and they spell it
out in more detail.


199
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:30,956
They take your privacy
very seriously.


200
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,606
They're never going to
post on Facebook for you.


201
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,576
They're not going to
give away your location.


202
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:40,036
So people can feel reassured
and more comfortable.


203
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:45,106
And nowhere is this privacy
going to be more important


204
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,876
than with your social
integration.


205
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:51,176
Now I've just given you a whole
lot of advice about things


206
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:52,966
to tell people before
they register,


207
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:55,806
but I want to encourage you that
when you're telling them all


208
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,126
of these things, be succinct.


209
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,486
Be as succinct as possible.


210
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,616
We all know that people don't


211
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:06,176
like to read long passages
of texts on an app.


212
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,286
They just tap, tap,
tap and get going so.


213
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,886
"Uber" does a great
job with this.


214
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,756
If you haven't experienced
"Uber" yet in San Francisco,


215
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,496
it's a car service, so
they'll come pick you up,


216
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,036
kind of like a taxi.


217
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,026
And you might think,
"Well, why do I have


218
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:24,316
to give them an email address
and a phone number just in order


219
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,956
to get a ride from A to B?"


220
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:31,256
And they explain here very
briefly, they're going


221
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,666
to send you notifications
about when the car is coming


222
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,526
and emails about
the confirmation.


223
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,726
So that makes you feel better.


224
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:45,296
So being succinct will keep
your registration process short,


225
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,556
and it will help encourage
people to actually read the text


226
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:52,756
that you've so carefully
crafted for that screen.


227
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,326
Now, another way that you
can make the process short is


228
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:58,476
to only collect what
you need right now.


229
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,636
Don't be tempted to ask
for a lot of information


230
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,226
because you have
this great feature


231
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,136
and you're probably
going to do it someday,


232
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:08,806
or maybe you're thinking about
doing this, so let's get date


233
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:12,416
of birth and let's ask their
gender and - you only want


234
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,436
to take what it is that
you're going to use


235
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,866
and what you've told the users
that you're going to do with it


236
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,636
so that people feel
comfortable giving it to you.


237
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:24,696
Otherwise, people are
going to be suspicious,


238
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:27,076
and that could prevent
them from actually going


239
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:28,646
through the registration
process.


240
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:33,626
So, if you do need people
to register in order


241
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,506
to use your app, keep
these things in mind,


242
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:39,106
follow these guidelines
and everyone is going


243
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:41,116
to feel really comfortable
and motivated


244
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,556
to give you their information.


245
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,816
All right, so now, let's get


246
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,856
into the onboarding
best practices.


247
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:54,916
As I said earlier, the best
experience is going to be


248
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,386
to just jump in and start
using that app right away.


249
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:02,346
So you want to ask yourselves,
"What do people need to know


250
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,916
in order to get started
with my app?"


251
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,266
And if the answer is
nothing, fantastic.


252
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,556
Don't put any onboarding in.


253
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:11,566
You're great.


254
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:13,536
Just let them in and
let them get going.


255
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:18,556
Now, if there are some things
like the rules for a game


256
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,776
or like the gestures that
they might need to know,


257
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:24,036
you want to tell them
just enough to get started


258
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,406
and then get out
of the way quickly.


259
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:32,056
So think about if you went into
a restaurant, and before you sat


260
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,196
down at the table,
the host said, "OK,


261
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,206
welcome to the restaurant.


262
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:37,956
I'm going to tell you
every single thing


263
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:40,656
on the menu right
now in great detail.


264
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:42,326
And by the way, here
are the things


265
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:43,576
that I think you should order."


266
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,096
That would be ridiculous, right?


267
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:49,316
So pushy. You really
just want to come in,


268
00:13:49,316 --> 00:13:52,406
get settled at your table,
peruse the menu at your leisure.


269
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:55,196
That's the experience
that you're after, right?


270
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,746
So that's what you
need to re-create


271
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,246
in your app or your game.


272
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,526
You want to do that equivalent


273
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,556
of leading people
in to their table.


274
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,596
Maybe you're going to tell them
the specials in a restaurant,


275
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,056
and then let them
explore on their own.


276
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:14,356
When people launch an app
or a game, they're expecting


277
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:17,346
to participate, they're not
expecting a long lecture.


278
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:22,606
So imagine you launched
"Calculator" app


279
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:27,176
and you saw something like
this, followed by this,


280
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,576
followed by this, oh my gosh.


281
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:35,376
Now, I'm not going to make
you guys sit through all seven


282
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,076
of these but you can see how
frustrating that would be


283
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:42,366
if you're faced with a long
list of marketing messages


284
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,666
about an app before
you even got to use it.


285
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:46,296
I mean, it's a calculator,
right?


286
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:52,576
So really, resist the temptation
to string together a whole lot


287
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,726
of long list of features
and marketing and hey,


288
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,126
make sure you check
this thing out.


289
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,416
People want to get
in and get going.


290
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,386
There is no need
for instructions


291
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:05,666
if the user interface
is intuitive to use


292
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:07,436
and the functionality
is obvious.


293
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,766
And if it isn't, I suggest


294
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:15,166
that you spend time reworking
the design, not sticking a bunch


295
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,626
of onboarding screens on there.


296
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,726
If you need to give a few UI
tips, you want to do it quickly


297
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,346
and get out of the
way, but otherwise,


298
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:28,876
avoid those long
marketing messages, OK?


299
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:32,346
Now, you always want to
start with the basics


300
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:34,576
and this is especially
important for games,


301
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:36,246
which are most often the place


302
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:38,446
where you need a little
information to get going.


303
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:42,006
Like with video games
with our App Store games,


304
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:44,636
you might want the backstory
so you know, you know,


305
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:45,926
what's the objective
of the game?


306
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:47,926
Or the backstory makes
it more fun, right?


307
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:50,496
But think about a
card game that you sit


308
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,746
down to play with friends.


309
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:55,116
First, you usually go over
OK, what are the rules?


310
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:56,566
How does play progress?


311
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:57,446
How do you win?


312
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:58,616
That's an important one.


313
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,326
And then you might even
try a couple of tips


314
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,206
on strategy all before
you start playing.


315
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:08,326
So just like that card game,
you start with the basics


316
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,926
and then you build up the
complexity from there.


317
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:13,536
Because you're not going
to be prepared to learn


318
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:15,346
about strategies for winning


319
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,156
if you don't understand
how the game is played


320
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:17,896
in the first place.


321
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:21,836
Let's look at a great
example, this is "Dots,"


322
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:23,916
and "Dots" is a puzzle game.


323
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,696
They need just a
little bit of onboarding


324
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:30,336
to explain how the game works,
and they've also touched


325
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,836
on the inspiration for the game.


326
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,596
They've got this quote here,
"A smart man once said,


327
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,196
'Everything eventually
connects.'" OK.


328
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:43,006
So the first thing, two
dots, connect them, got it.


329
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:47,536
Now, a couple more dots.


330
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,606
Now different colors of dots.


331
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:55,956
[ Game Sounds ]


332
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:59,146
Pretty basic, but they're
building up the complexity


333
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,266
as you go, and they're
reinforcing everything


334
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:05,156
with sound and animation
and positive reassurance


335
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,146
as you're going through.


336
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:08,016
So it is completely interactive.


337
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:11,685
So that's a great
way to get started.


338
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:15,516
And now, I know that this seems
like a pretty simple example,


339
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,576
but really, almost any kind
of game benefits from this:


340
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:21,445
builders, role-playing games,
arcade games, all of it.


341
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:23,806
Let's take a look
at "Hitman GO."


342
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:27,826
Now, "Hitman GO" has eliminated
onboarding altogether.


343
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,296
They just put you in
the game right away.


344
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,436
It's a great experience.


345
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:34,576
But to set people
up for success,


346
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:38,496
the very basic levels
start - the first levels


347
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,896
that you play start
with very basic actions.


348
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:43,166
So what's the first
thing you need to know


349
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,496
in order to play this game?


350
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:50,056
Well, that's how to move
and how to win, right?


351
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:55,576
OK, we got a straight line,
I only have one choice.


352
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,816
All right, one more choice.


353
00:17:58,436 --> 00:17:59,596
Hooray. Success.


354
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:02,036
I mean, it was very easy.


355
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:04,856
It's a no-lose situation,
but that's teaching you.


356
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:05,946
What's the objective?


357
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:07,246
I want to get to that big,


358
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:09,186
dark circle at the end
of the screen, right?


359
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:13,636
How do I move along the path?


360
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:15,976
Next, they introduce
you to obstacles.


361
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:23,336
Again, I've got one
path, and I'm a hit man,


362
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:25,056
and this guy's back
is towards me


363
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:32,276
so he was a pretty easy target.


364
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:36,106
Again, it's a can't-lose
level, but I'm playing the game


365
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,246
and I'm learning as
I go, so it's fun.


366
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,296
It's not onboarding.


367
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:40,536
I'm playing a game here.


368
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,946
Now as the levels progress,
they get more difficult.


369
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,456
You get choices in your path,


370
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:49,476
and now your obstacle here
is facing you so that's going


371
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:50,496
to be a little trickier.


372
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,316
And trust me, it gets
much, much harder.


373
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,726
You get different kinds of
obstacles, more of them.


374
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:58,006
Trapdoors and things like that.


375
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:01,166
When you first start
playing, all you have


376
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:02,906
to do is complete the level.


377
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:07,096
Get to that dark
circle at the end.


378
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:10,236
But the more you play, the
more challenges you have.


379
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,586
So now, I'm not just
completing the level,


380
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,666
I need to collect the briefcase,


381
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,246
I got to do it in
12 moves or less.


382
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,576
It's getting more complex.


383
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,816
And this is giving
me more challenges


384
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:25,006
and it's encouraging
repeat gameplay as well.


385
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:29,076
I mean, because if you had to
start on this level, hoo-wee,


386
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:32,036
I think that would last
all of about 30 seconds,


387
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:33,926
and then I'd be off
to find another game.


388
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:37,486
Now starting simply and building


389
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,386
up the complexity is
called scaffolding.


390
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,486
And that's how you
can set up new players


391
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:44,456
to have an enjoyable experience.


392
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:46,836
It's going to keep them
coming back to your game.


393
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:50,196
But this approach also
works for apps as well.


394
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:54,026
You want to teach the basic
things, how to navigate


395
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,776
and the general purpose
functions,


396
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,936
before you even consider
trying to teach people


397
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,766
about more advanced operations.


398
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,526
Now, this is "Yahoo!


399
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:05,286
News Digest."


400
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:08,066
It's one of this year's
Apple Design Award winners.


401
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,686
Now, they've got a fantastic UI


402
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,286
as you might have
guessed by their award.


403
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,516
It's intuitive to use, so none


404
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:19,746
of their onboarding
is covering UI.


405
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,816
Now, the way that
its news works is


406
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,616
that it's a daily
digest twice a day.


407
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:27,336
And this is an entirely new
paradigm for Yahoo News,


408
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,386
who have quite an
established audience.


409
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:33,566
So it's really important to
set people's expectations


410
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,686
about the content that they
were going to be seeing.


411
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:38,276
Otherwise, people
might be confused


412
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:39,396
about the purpose of the app.


413
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,546
So by putting together
just three short screens


414
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,106
with the supportive
illustrations,


415
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:49,286
and then getting you right into
the news, they're setting you


416
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,166
up for success in a
different kind of way.


417
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:54,516
And this approach
is not appropriate


418
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,176
for all kinds of apps or games.


419
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:59,136
It's really when you're
breaking into a new market


420
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:01,636
or that you're establishing
some sort of new paradigm


421
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:04,396
that you might need to
communicate just a little bit


422
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:05,936
about your core concept.


423
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:09,276
And that's going to help
people understand the products


424
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:11,076
and quite frankly,
appreciate it, right?


425
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:15,256
So, just three short screens and
then getting you into the news


426
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,946
because they're going to
get out of the way quickly.


427
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:21,726
So think about the basic, basic
things that people would need


428
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:24,076
to know in order to
start playing your game


429
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,786
or using your app.


430
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:28,676
And think about if any of
them really need explaining,


431
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,176
because again, if you
don't - if they don't,


432
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,596
don't do any onboarding, right?


433
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:38,006
But if you do, consider
the ways that you can start


434
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,596
with the basics and
build up the complexity.


435
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,296
With games, it's going to be how
to move, what's the objective,


436
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:46,426
how do you win and
things like that.


437
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,186
And when you're teaching
these things,


438
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,716
make sure you're only
teaching one thing at a time.


439
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:57,126
It is so much harder to learn
if you're dealt with a bunch


440
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:59,326
of instructions at
once or if it's -


441
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,606
especially if it's related to
something unfamiliar, right?


442
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:04,726
OK, I'm going to give all of
you guys some instructions.


443
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:10,396
After this, I want you to leave
Moscone, make two left turns,


444
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:12,026
then a right down the alleyway.


445
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:15,926
Go to the coffee shop on the
corner, order two lattes,


446
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,356
one decaf, one low fat.


447
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:21,726
Put three sugars in the
decaf one and one sugar


448
00:22:21,726 --> 00:22:23,876
in the low fat one and then
bring them back to me here.


449
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:29,346
Got it? If anyone got
that, I'm looking forward


450
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,416
to my latte after this.


451
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:33,836
But you can see how
difficult that is.


452
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:36,256
I'm sure you guys are all
tuned out on step three.


453
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,966
People are going to
be much more able


454
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,216
to follow those instructions


455
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:43,096
if they're parceled
out one at a time.


456
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:47,056
So if I said, "Go out of
Moscone, make two left turns,


457
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,266
and then when you
get to the corner,


458
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,406
I'll tell you what to do."


459
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,906
And then I'll say, "Go
to the coffee shop."


460
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,196
And then when you get to the
register, I text you, "Hey,


461
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:58,316
here's the coffee that
I want you to order" -


462
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,016
this would be so much easier.


463
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,806
So you want to give
instructions one at a time


464
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:06,286
and give people a chance


465
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,546
to apply those instructions
before you start teaching


466
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:09,826
anything else.


467
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:12,906
So this is "Leo's
Fortune," another one


468
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,346
of our Apple Design Award
winners from this year.


469
00:23:16,306 --> 00:23:19,746
It's a really fun
platform adventure game set


470
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,446
in these really gorgeous
environments.


471
00:23:22,586 --> 00:23:25,626
And their tutorial
level is fantastic.


472
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,566
They first start
to explain the game


473
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:29,896
with a little bit of backstory.


474
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,646
They introduce you to Leopold.


475
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:35,116
They let you know he's lost
his fortune and you're going


476
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:35,946
to help him reclaim it.


477
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:40,216
So this translates into
"get the gold coins."


478
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,066
Now you got your
objective, right?


479
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,956
Next step is just about
how to hold your device.


480
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:50,406
They're getting you used to
this idea that the left side


481
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,576
of the screen and the right
side of the screen are going


482
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,596
to do something different,


483
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:55,896
but they haven't told
you what that is yet.


484
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:58,686
Just put your thumbs
in this position,


485
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,726
and that gets you holding
the device in the best way.


486
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:06,046
Now, once you press your
thumbs in each circle,


487
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:07,616
then they're talking
about movement.


488
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:09,626
What do you do with
your left thumb?


489
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:11,656
Well first, we're
just going to forwards


490
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:14,206
and backwards, the very basics.


491
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:18,026
And then you get a chance to
play with that a little bit.


492
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,016
You're going to collect
some coins, go through some


493
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:21,026
of the cool environments.


494
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,886
And then, a slight obstacle.


495
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:27,686
Now, there's a little chalk
drawing to help you out


496
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:28,906
or some words on the right


497
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:31,256
that lets you know now
it's time you're going


498
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:34,746
to use your right thumb, here
we go, get up over that ledge.


499
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:38,476
And then, a chance to play.


500
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:41,696
They give you things to jump
over, things to jump onto.


501
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:45,596
And next step, some
more obstacles.


502
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:48,456
Here, it's about using that
up gesture for something else.


503
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:49,606
So they're building


504
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:53,986
up the complexity while teaching
you one thing at a time.


505
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:56,766
Pushing up on that lever is
going to release the drawbridge,


506
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:58,956
and then you can
continue on your way.


507
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:03,626
Then you'll learn about pushing
down and what that does for you.


508
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,416
So "Leo's Fortune" -
one skill at a time,


509
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:10,776
which is so manageable, and
it's fun because you're playing.


510
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:14,006
So it's a great example
of scaffolding,


511
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:18,236
along with "Hitman GO" and
several other examples.


512
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:22,866
So the first thing you do,
is you learn the objective,


513
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:25,136
collect those gold coins.


514
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:27,576
Next thing you're going to learn


515
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:30,136
about is the optimal
hand position, right?


516
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,706
So they're building up the
complexity with the scaffolding.


517
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:35,686
And the next thing
that you learn


518
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:38,936
about is really basic
movement - how to go forwards,


519
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:42,546
what are you doing
with your left hand?


520
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:44,116
Next step is obstacles,


521
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:47,856
which you conquer using your
right hand and various gestures.


522
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,756
And then further in the game,


523
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:53,096
they start showing you
advanced obstacles or puzzles.


524
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:57,626
So you can see how the
complexity builds up that way.


525
00:25:57,846 --> 00:25:59,606
Now like I said, the
same thing applies


526
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,236
to apps, it's not just games.


527
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,196
You can teach people by doing.


528
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:05,686
You don't want to show them
a lot of screens upfront.


529
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:08,966
Now Pinterest - this
is Pinterest,


530
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,156
and they use onboarding
just for a specific feature.


531
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:15,956
So they have a new guided
search feature, and they needed


532
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,436
to teach people new to the app


533
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:21,416
and also returning users
how to go about using it.


534
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,946
And they do a great
job of parceling


535
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:26,056
out this information
one step at a time.


536
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,726
So the first time you
go to the Search tab


537
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:30,286
after this feature
was introduced,


538
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:31,636
you get a little
bit of information.


539
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:34,126
And they've given
you some samples.


540
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:37,426
And these samples are all things
that I'm pretty interested in.


541
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,346
So they've done a great job


542
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:42,136
in making this a really
valuable exercise for me.


543
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:48,056
Now I happen to like nail art,
and so next I tap, they explain


544
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:51,366
to me how to refine that
search even further.


545
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:55,856
And then once I've
done some refinement,


546
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,996
they talk about even
more advanced refinement,


547
00:26:58,336 --> 00:26:59,286
free typing in.


548
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:03,026
And because you're getting this
information one step at a time,


549
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:06,156
it's much easier to
understand what to do,


550
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,096
and they're letting you
execute on these instructions


551
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:10,396
so you're really learning.


552
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,796
You're taking it all in.


553
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,296
You're much more likely


554
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:16,156
to remember this later next time
you go to search for something.


555
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:22,216
With all of these examples,
it wasn't overwhelming, right?


556
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:26,456
And you're actually able
to use what you've learned


557
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:29,126
because you're playing
the game or using an app.


558
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:36,216
Because people learn better by
doing than they do by reading


559
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:40,896
or listening when it
comes to apps or games.


560
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,516
"Dots," "Hitman GO,"
"Leo's Fortune" -


561
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,006
they all reinforce what
they're teaching you with play.


562
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:49,466
And Pinterest was letting you
actually search for things.


563
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:51,036
It wasn't a canned experience.


564
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,466
Those were real search
terms with real refinements.


565
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:58,766
So even though this is
a really super easy,


566
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:01,106
can't-lose level
on "Hitman GO" -


567

[ Game Sounds ]


568
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,616
- it's a lot more fun
than this would be, right?


569
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:19,196
Now Benjamin Franklin has
a great quote about this:


570
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:21,336
"Tell me and I forget.


571
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,086
Teach me and I remember.


572
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:24,866
Involve me and I learn."


573
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:29,276
That's why you want to avoid
screenshots and modal displays.


574
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,046
Anything that's going to
take you out of context


575
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:34,066
or prevent you from
actually using the app


576
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:36,066
or game isn't going
to be as effective.


577
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:42,016
Again, what if this was the
experience with calculator?


578
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,476
It would be terrible, right?


579
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,256
First of all, the UI is


580
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,566
so dimmed you can barely
see the buttons at all.


581
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:53,666
Secondly, you don't need to say
tap here, tap here, tap here all


582
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,056
over a touch interface.


583
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,536
It's a touch interface.


584
00:28:56,756 --> 00:29:00,546
You tap. And my biggest pet
peeve is when I see "Click here"


585
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:05,446
on touch devices - ooh,
that really gets me.


586
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:10,086
Now again, if your buttons don't
look obviously interactive,


587
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:11,886
redesign your buttons.


588
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,646
Don't put some modal
display letting you know


589
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:15,926
that you can tap places.


590
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:20,336
So if you do need onboarding,


591
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:23,436
make sure that your experience
lets people participate.


592
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:28,766
And you can use animation
to do a lot of teaching.


593
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:30,376
It's a really powerful tool.


594
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:33,236
And there is a lot of great
information about the craft


595
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:35,556
of the animation in Tuesday's


596
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:37,666
"Designing Intuitive
Interfaces" sessions.


597
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,276
So if you didn't
see the session,


598
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:40,996
check out the video,
it's available.


599
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:45,596
For today, I would just
like to talk specifically


600
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:49,206
about something that I
see in games all the time:


601
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:52,516
the giant bouncing arrow.


602
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:58,506
Now at first, this does
seem like an effective way


603
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,396
to get people through
a tutorial level.


604
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:06,406
Great. But then, you know,
while it starts to show people


605
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:10,306
where to look, it eventually
becomes distracting.


606
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,476
When there's more information on
the screen, you're not looking


607
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:16,646
at the information, you're just
looking at the arrow and where


608
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,906
to tap and thinking, "I
want to play the game.


609
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:20,246
I don't want to read
the tutorial."


610
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:24,236
So you're looking at this
button instead of looking


611
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,136
at what the different characters
are going to do for you.


612
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:28,156
Why you're picking them.


613
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,806
The strategy of a game, or how
much it's going to cost you


614
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:33,396
or what the reward
is going to be.


615
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:37,966
So pretty soon, your game
has gone from, you know,


616
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:41,866
"happy ice cream fun time" or
whatever to "tap the arrow."


617
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:44,446
No one wants to play
tap the arrow.


618
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:45,826
That's not a fun game.


619
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:49,336
Tap the arrow gets
old so quickly.


620
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:51,476
Another way you can
kind of think


621
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,386
of it is I don't know
how many of you have pets


622
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:55,816
but if you've ever tried to
point something out to a dog


623
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:59,106
or a cat, they often
just wind up looking


624
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:00,206
at your finger, right?


625
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:03,796
[ Applause ]


626
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:10,676
Yea. So this is exactly what
you're doing with tap the arrow.


627
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:12,526
People aren't going
to be looking


628
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,046
at what you're pointing
towards, they're going


629
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:15,256
to be looking at the arrow.


630
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:20,496
So rather than pointing,
try a suggestive animation,


631
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:23,056
one that's going to help lead
people's eye to the right part


632
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,206
of the screen or let them
know what they should do.


633
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:28,476
This is a really basic
example but it's a good one.


634
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:33,076
With "Hitman GO," you don't
need an arrow or a graphic


635
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:35,966
or some other kind of bouncy
arrow thing to let you know


636
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:38,536
that this is a button in
addition to being the name.


637
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,556
That pulsing animation
draws you to it.


638
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:43,026
It makes you want
to tap it, right?


639
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:47,126
I mean, they could have had
an arrow pointing, "Tap here,


640
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:51,886
tap here," but you
don't need to do that.


641
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:54,666
So that's what I mean about
using animation thoughtfully.


642
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:58,466
I hope I look forward to seeing
far fewer bouncing arrows


643
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,076
in the future.


644
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:03,706
Now, if you do need your
onboarding, another thing


645
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:07,776
to keep - be wary of is
there is no need to point


646
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:09,796
out any platform conventions.


647
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:12,866
You only point out
the unconventional


648
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:15,736
because everybody knows
there is another screen


649
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,746
of app icons available
in this folder.


650
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:20,726
The paging dots take
care of that for you.


651
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,456
You don't - you wouldn't need
to put an arrow or some text


652
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:25,956
that says swipe to the
side to see more icons.


653
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:26,966
It would be ridiculous.


654
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:31,596
Similarly, you don't have
to tell people that tab bars


655
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,026
and toolbars are interactive.


656
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:35,756
They instinctively
look that way.


657
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:38,716
Or that you can swipe
for more content


658
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:42,266
because the content bleeding off
the edge does that job for you.


659
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,236
And that's really one of
the greatest advantages


660
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:47,996
of using platform conventions.


661
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:51,566
People will just instinctively
know how to interact with them,


662
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,626
so you won't need any onboarding
for these type of things.


663
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,476
You only want to point out
anything that's distinct


664
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,986
and unique and unfamiliar
to your audience.


665
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:06,616
Now, another thing to be wary
of is forcing people to go


666
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:09,256
down a secondary path that
they may not want to take.


667
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:12,246
So think about a
photo application.


668
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:15,366
I don't want to be
forced to crop an image


669
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:17,546
if I don't think it
needs to be cropped.


670
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,236
If I don't want to
apply a photo filter


671
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,616
to a photo, I shouldn't have to.


672
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:25,746
This is my app, I want to
do what I want with it.


673
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:28,976
Similarly, with music
applications,


674
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:32,616
it's great to show people how
to make a playlist or a station,


675
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:36,426
but don't make them market a
favorite if it's not a favorite.


676
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,106
That's just frustrating.


677
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:43,056
Now, when it comes to
text like I said before,


678
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,976
shorter is always better.


679
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,686
We know that people
are not inclined


680
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:50,196
to read really long
passages unless it's a book,


681
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:55,266
so make sure your language
is short and clear.


682
00:33:56,316 --> 00:34:00,096
Avoid jargon and acronyms
or insider language


683
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:01,186
that may not make sense


684
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:03,536
to someone who's
new to your app, OK?


685
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:08,436
This is my favorite example,
"JUKELY," and they're talking


686
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:09,775
about their notifications.


687
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:14,426
It's so fun, a mixtape
from a stalker.


688
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:15,886
I'm excited.


689
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:22,775
I mean, this text is clear,
it's friendly, it's entertaining


690
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,505
as well as being educational.


691
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,835
So here are some
things you can think


692
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,426
about when it comes
to writing your text.


693
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:31,906
Ask yourself these questions.


694
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,696
Could the text be shorter
or could it be clearer?


695
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:39,396
Will the text make sense
to someone who's new


696
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:43,025
to the application, because
you look at your app all day


697
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:47,116
and all night every day, so you
really need fresh perspective,


698
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:50,136
and what will someone
unfamiliar with your app think?


699
00:34:50,616 --> 00:34:53,866
Is the message too complicated?


700
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:58,596
If it is, you can make it
simpler, or maybe you need


701
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,276
to change your approach
altogether.


702
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:05,606
Or would images work
better than text?


703
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:08,526
There's our phrase, "A picture
is worth a thousand words."


704
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:12,006
Sometimes, it's just easier
to do it with a drawing,


705
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:13,796
like with "Leo's Fortune."


706
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:17,746
That little chalk drawing
is much - is a quick read.


707
00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:22,446
You can hop up and go on your
way as opposed to saying, "OK.


708
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:24,586
When you get here,
lift your thumb up so


709
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:26,306
that Leo will hop
over the ledge."


710
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:27,936
That would be ridiculous.


711
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:32,676
And make sure that it feels
like an extension of your brand,


712
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:36,306
because onboarding is going
to be the first experience


713
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:38,196
that somebody has
with your app or game.


714
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:40,566
It's kind of like a
wedding invitation


715
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:41,926
or a party invitation.


716
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:45,346
It's going to set the tone
for the entire experience,


717
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:48,716
so make sure it feels
exactly like your brand,


718
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:52,996
like the personality
of your app.


719
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:56,056
And this is a very
important one:


720
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:59,396
Always give people
an option to skip.


721
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:04,146
Always. If you saw the lunchtime
session yesterday, Natalia talks


722
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:06,486
about the dark days
of the interwebs


723
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:10,456
with the big crazy flash intros,
and all people wanted was


724
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:12,016
"skip intro, skip intro."


725
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:14,766
And that's exactly what
we're talking about here.


726
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:19,516
You don't know if someone has
used your app on another device,


727
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:23,236
if they watched their friend
use your app, or quite frankly,


728
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:25,186
if they're just impatient
and want to get going.


729
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:28,806
If people don't want to watch
your onboarding no matter how


730
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:32,106
awesome it is, don't make them.


731
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:35,556
And finally, learning should
be an enjoyable experience.


732
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:37,566
It's going to be pleasant.


733
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:41,496
Again, it's your first
impression of the app


734
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:45,306
or the game, so you want to
make sure that it's a good one.


735
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:47,716
Let's take a look at "Flight,"


736
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:51,256
which I think they have a really
great onboarding experience.


737
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:53,876
That Close button up there
is your option to skip.


738
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:56,776
And the UI is based
solely on gestures,


739
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:58,486
and so that's why they
wanted to give some -


740
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,876
just a very brief
onboarding explanation.


741
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:05,236
The text invokes
the joy of travel.


742
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,056
It's just a few short screens.


743
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:15,766
The visual design matches
every other aspect of the app.


744
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,176
And when you're all done,
you tap "Ready to fly,"


745
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,166
and you get a nice
little animation.


746
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:21,986
Fun, right?


747
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:26,656
Enjoyable, short and pleasant.


748
00:37:26,696 --> 00:37:29,206
So make sure if you need
to provide onboarding


749
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,716
that you're doing
in a way that's fun.


750
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:33,116
Nobody likes a long
boring lecture.


751
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:36,816
So these are the things
that you need to strive


752
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:41,116
for if you need onboarding
- if you need onboarding.


753
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:45,126
Now, whether or not you
have an app or a game,


754
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:48,456
one thing that's always a
challenge is how to teach people


755
00:37:48,456 --> 00:37:51,556
about gestures or
gyroscope enhancements,


756
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:53,536
anything that doesn't
have some sort


757
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,126
of visual representation
in the UI.


758
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:59,896
So let me give you
a few tips about how


759
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:01,596
to make the invisible visible.


760
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,916
And the first one is
using animation cues.


761
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,916
Now I know none of you are going
to make a big bouncy arrow,


762
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:11,976
but there's a lot of
things that you can do


763
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:14,706
to convey the interactivity
or the gestures


764
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:15,916
in a very elegant way.


765
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:21,416
You'll keep people focused
on the UI, not on the cues.


766
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:23,536
This is "JETSETTER."


767
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:27,786
It's an app that specializes
in luxury hotels and resorts.


768
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,386
And they've got tons of amazing
photography, which is one


769
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,546
of the things that sets them
apart from their competitors.


770
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:38,876
This gentle drift of
the photo lets you know


771
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:41,536
that it's interactive,
that you can touch it


772
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:45,816
and explore different aspects
of this stunning kitchen.


773
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:51,986
It invites you to touch it.


774
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:55,646
Now, the Withings health tracker
app uses horizontal movement


775
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:57,466
to show that the
screens are swipable.


776
00:38:58,156 --> 00:39:02,606
So that - and if you don't
swipe it, it will auto-advance.


777
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:06,856
And they've got a nice rewind
page flip type of animation


778
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:09,016
at the end so that you know
you've hit the last item,


779
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:11,306
and then you can flip
through for anything you might


780
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:11,716
have missed.


781
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:17,676
And those are just some of the
ways that you can use animation


782
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:21,016
to really help encourage
people or explain gestures


783
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:22,316
or other aspects of the UI.


784
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:25,736
And again, there were
a lot of tips on this


785
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:27,966
in Tuesday's session,
so make sure to check it


786
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,796
out if you didn't
already see it.


787
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:35,006
Now, another effective teaching
tool is temporary hints.


788
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:37,486
Just really quick
tips about gestures.


789
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,416
This is "Yahoo!


790
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:42,346
News Digest" again, and
as I showed earlier,


791
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,476
their onboarding is all
about the core concept.


792
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,606
So instead, once you get
into the UI, they don't need


793
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:51,456
to tell you about
that ahead of time,


794
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:53,026
but they give you just a couple


795
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:55,196
of animation cues
and temporary hints.


796
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:59,346
So tapping on an article
headline has a horizontal


797
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:04,976
animation and then that
short message about swiping.


798
00:40:05,086 --> 00:40:08,096
So if the horizontal
animation didn't do it for you,


799
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:10,916
this message, which only
appears for two seconds,


800
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:13,356
makes it abundantly
clear that you can swipe


801
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:14,456
from article to article.


802
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:17,816
And you'll notice, they
didn't force you to swipe.


803
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:20,746
Because I might be interested
in reading this article.


804
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:26,096
They just want to make sure
you know how to navigate.


805
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:28,166
"Lightly" has a different
approach.


806
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,456
It's a photo editing
application,


807
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:33,606
and the first time you use
it, they give you hints


808
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,236
about gestures with short tips.


809
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:39,736
So here, I've just selected the
Argyle filter, and so what comes


810
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:42,486
up is a message about
adjusting the intensity.


811
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:47,256
Now, I just want to point out,
they don't actually force you


812
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:48,536
to adjust the intensity.


813
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,496
Any other - any place that you
tap will dismiss that hint,


814
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,856
whether it's adjusting
the intensity,


815
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,556
picking another filter from
the bottom or using any


816
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,326
of the other controls.


817
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:05,006
So in addition to
displaying temporary hints,


818
00:41:05,366 --> 00:41:08,746
you can also think about
providing controls for people


819
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:11,706
to turn them on, and
this is what we do


820
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,366
in "GarageBand" on iOS.


821
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:16,736
Now, this is something
that's more appropriate


822
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:18,266
for deeper applications.


823
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:20,706
Not every app warrants this.


824
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,996
And you can come in and just
start playing these drums


825
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:26,376
and going nuts without
any assistance at all,


826
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:29,776
but if you want to know
more, get a deeper knowledge


827
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:33,576
about drumming, because it's
sort of a specialty case.


828
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:35,416
If you want to become
a better musician,


829
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:40,606
then using that question mark
button up in the corner turns


830
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:43,006
on these non-modal tips,


831
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:48,436
so you can keep playing the
drums while you're reading more


832
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:48,966
about them.


833
00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:52,466
And without those non-modal
tips - without these tips,


834
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:54,996
you might not realize that
you can get different sounds


835
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:59,616
out of the hi-hat based on where
it is that you're tapping it,


836
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:02,256
or that a single tap will
play the crash cymbal


837
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:06,326
and the bass drum together, but
a two-finger tap is what results


838
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:07,926
in just the crash cymbal.


839
00:42:08,536 --> 00:42:11,076
Or you wouldn't know
that the speed


840
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:13,306
of the drum repeat is
determined by the distance


841
00:42:13,306 --> 00:42:14,436
between your two fingers.


842
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:15,776
All really useful.


843
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:19,116
So if you think you
have an audience


844
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:21,996
that wants a deeper knowledge
or needs extra guidance


845
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:27,426
on a specialized subject,
this could be a good method.


846
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:30,766
And it's really important that
you can continue to use the app


847
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:32,686
so that you can learn by doing.


848
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:38,996
You can put it into
practice right on the spot.


849
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:41,416
Because all of these
approaches work best


850
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,856
if they're shown in context.


851
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:46,016
It's important that when
you're demonstrating gestures,


852
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:47,706
you want to do it
right in the moment


853
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:50,136
when people can experiment
with them


854
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:51,446
so that they're learning
by doing.


855
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:57,356
So now, I would like to address
a dirty word in iOS UI design.


856
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:00,726
Help. Help.


857
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,376
Nobody wants to think
they need help,


858
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:05,906
or nobody wants to ask for help.


859
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:10,906
And as a designer, I certainly
hope that every aspect


860
00:43:10,906 --> 00:43:14,566
of my UI is intuitive
to use to every person


861
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:17,796
in every scenario no
matter what their needs.


862
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:22,096
But sometimes, this
is hard to achieve.


863
00:43:23,486 --> 00:43:25,936
I mean, people have
different experiences,


864
00:43:26,126 --> 00:43:27,096
different backgrounds.


865
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:28,996
They come from different
cultures.


866
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:31,316
They may have a lot
of experience


867
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:35,756
with the Apple platform but not
with iOS or specialty knowledge.


868
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,836
Like, I can navigate
around just about any app


869
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:42,146
on the Apple platform but
I'm not a good photographer.


870
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,826
So all those filters
and photo effects,


871
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:47,126
I don't know what
to do with them.


872
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:49,256
I don't know when I should
use them, how they're going


873
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:50,526
to make my pictures better.


874
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:54,166
And that's where help
can be very handy.


875
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,576
But it's not so as to feel like
a lecture from a mean teacher.


876
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:02,146
Or boring.


877
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:03,676
Nobody wants boring.


878
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,486
We're moving away from that
large reference manual, right?


879
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:09,506
It should feel more like this.


880
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:12,716
Just making things a
little bit easier on people.


881
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:17,196
Or maybe like support from
a friend or a family member,


882
00:44:17,236 --> 00:44:18,386
just giving you a
couple of tips,


883
00:44:19,446 --> 00:44:21,166
because I'm definitely
not suggesting


884
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:24,906
that you add a huge reference
document to your app.


885
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:27,596
There are a lot of ways
that you can provide help


886
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,226
without people even
realizing that they got any.


887
00:44:30,226 --> 00:44:34,816
One of the easiest
things that you can do is


888
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:37,296
to put instructions in
your empty containers.


889
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:42,296
Rather than just saying "no
results for search" or "nothing


890
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:45,206
to see here," you want
to keep an empty view


891
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:46,276
from being a dead end.


892
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:51,316
If it all possible, let people
know what to expect here or how


893
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,206
to get out of this
dead-end situation.


894
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:57,986
So in iMovie for iOS,
there is a theater view


895
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:02,256
where your completed projects
go so you can view them.


896
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,486
Now, before you create
any projects,


897
00:45:04,486 --> 00:45:05,756
there is nothing to show here.


898
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:08,776
So the message lets you know
exactly what you're going


899
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:12,356
to find here in the future,
and then they tell you how


900
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:13,686
to get started making
a product -


901
00:45:13,726 --> 00:45:17,076
project so that you can have
a movie here really quickly.


902
00:45:17,696 --> 00:45:21,166
And it's worth pointing out that
both the message and the icon


903
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,766
in the navigation
are interactive,


904
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:25,886
so you can get going quickly
while you're learning the UI.


905
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:31,886
And this same approach can work
for empty input fields too.


906
00:45:32,406 --> 00:45:34,786
Placeholder text can
be super informative.


907
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,786
This is "UpTo," which
is a calendar app.


908
00:45:40,396 --> 00:45:42,366
You can of course manage
your own appointments,


909
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,876
but one of the things
that's cool about "UpTo" is


910
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:47,626
that you can also subscribe
to other people's calendars,


911
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,186
and the other people
can be your friends,


912
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:52,136
or it can be Barack Obama.


913
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:55,256
And they have tons of
calendars available in here


914
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,436
so you can browse to
find the ones you want,


915
00:45:57,706 --> 00:45:59,126
but you can also search,


916
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:04,196
and that Search text is very
suggestive in terms of the type


917
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,046
of things that you might
want to put in there.


918
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:09,496
Now, I got the impression from
the graphic that I could search


919
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:12,956
for sports teams, but I didn't
realize I could just type


920
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:16,966
in San Francisco and see all
the listings for San Francisco.


921
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:23,046
It's very helpful, and it
didn't feel like help, right?


922
00:46:23,236 --> 00:46:26,206
I didn't even realize
I needed any help,


923
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:27,606
but yet I've learned
something new.


924
00:46:28,096 --> 00:46:33,476
You can also think about showing
supporting information right


925
00:46:33,476 --> 00:46:38,166
inline, and we do this with
settings - not all settings


926
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:39,406
because they don't all need it.


927
00:46:40,206 --> 00:46:42,736
Date & Time is a pretty
universal concept;


928
00:46:42,736 --> 00:46:44,226
there is nothing
else to say here.


929
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:46,986
The Dial Assist, well,


930
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,576
some people might have some
questions about what that is.


931
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:52,286
So there's just a little bit


932
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:54,596
of more information
right in that moment.


933
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:58,126
Again, it didn't feel like help.


934
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:01,296
And with games, "Leo's Fortune."


935
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:03,416
That chalk drawing is
giving you that little hint.


936
00:47:04,586 --> 00:47:06,796
And they don't just do this
in the tutorial level -


937
00:47:06,796 --> 00:47:10,046
it's throughout the game.


938
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:13,496
In fact, showing information
inline is often a great


939
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:15,656
alternative to onboarding
altogether.


940
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,986
You don't have to tell
everything up front.


941
00:47:18,576 --> 00:47:22,496
Just put the extra information
inline so it's there right


942
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:24,606
in that moment that
people need it.


943
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:29,836
Now, another great approach
is to watch for indications


944
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:31,866
that people are stuck.


945
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:35,436
Now, when it comes to games,
though, you have to be wary


946
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,796
about over-helping people
because it's a game,


947
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:41,126
nobody enjoys having the
puzzle solved for them.


948
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,076
That's not fun.


949
00:47:42,886 --> 00:47:45,806
You want to give people a
chance to play all on their own


950
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,906
and then watch for clues
they might be stuck.


951
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:52,636
And that's when you
offer the help.


952
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:56,136
With "Leo's Fortune," if you
try a number of times to get


953
00:47:56,136 --> 00:47:58,716
over this very basic obstacle
and you don't make it,


954
00:48:00,016 --> 00:48:02,046
they give you the option
of onscreen controls.


955
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:05,076
Again, they only
do this if it looks


956
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:07,666
like you're struggling
with that first jump.


957
00:48:09,116 --> 00:48:11,166
"The Room Two" also
has a great approach.


958
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:15,716
Now, if you haven't played it,
it's a mystery puzzler game.


959
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,816
You're stuck in this room and
you follow clue, after clue,


960
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:20,616
after clue to make your escape.


961
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,386
Now, if you've been
struggling for a long time,


962
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:26,556
and you still didn't manage
to accomplish the next thing,


963
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,196
they give you this
question mark button.


964
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:35,986
And this is great because it's
giving you the option of a hint.


965
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:37,676
Because it's true,
I might be stuck,


966
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:40,606
or I may have been distracted.


967
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:44,626
My dog may have started barking,
or someone needed something


968
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:45,806
and walked into the room.


969
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:49,186
So that's really good because
they're not solving the puzzle


970
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:50,406
for me.


971
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:55,316
However, if I am really
stuck and I'm at the point


972
00:48:55,316 --> 00:48:57,556
of walking away, it's
enough to keep me engaged,


973
00:48:57,556 --> 00:48:58,716
to keep me moving forward.


974
00:48:59,276 --> 00:49:03,126
And instead of giving away the
answers, they give you clues


975
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:04,996
so you don't have
to feel guilty.


976
00:49:04,996 --> 00:49:06,516
It doesn't have to
feel like cheating.


977
00:49:06,596 --> 00:49:08,526
You don't have to feel
bad about it, right?


978
00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:11,936
And this doesn't devalue
the achievements of people


979
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:12,956
who didn't use the clues.


980
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:14,676
We're all going to
get to the end.


981
00:49:15,826 --> 00:49:17,836
Some of us are going
to get there faster,


982
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:19,496
but this works out really well.


983
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:22,066
Everyone can feel really good
when they finish the game.


984
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:26,706
And these kind of hints can
be helpful with apps too.


985
00:49:27,646 --> 00:49:29,376
This is "Sky Guide," another one


986
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:31,556
of this year's Apple
Design Award winners.


987
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:35,926
You can pan all around the sky
and see the constellations,


988
00:49:36,286 --> 00:49:40,906
planets, comets, all sorts
of stars, and they have a ton


989
00:49:40,906 --> 00:49:45,166
of information about almost
anything in the night sky.


990
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:48,786
Now, you might think that
tapping on a star is the way


991
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:50,046
to get that information,


992
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:53,046
but that would make it a
little too easy to navigate


993
00:49:53,046 --> 00:49:55,206
into the details view
- if you're going there


994
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:57,356
on accident then you'd
be getting frustrated.


995
00:49:58,226 --> 00:50:03,116
So instead, the right way to
get to that information is


996
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:06,006
by selecting a star and
then tapping that "i" button


997
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,306
on the right side of the screen.


998
00:50:07,876 --> 00:50:13,476
And if you tap a star
again to try and select it


999
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:16,346
or get more information,
you get a pulsing animation,


1000
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:19,296
and that glow calls
attention to itself.


1001
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,756
They're using animation
to attract your attention.


1002
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:25,376
And that's really elegant


1003
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:28,526
because if you double-tap
a star thinking oh,


1004
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,406
maybe I didn't tap hard enough
or maybe I need to tap twice,


1005
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:35,036
they pulse every time you
tap, to get your attention.


1006
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:39,586
So they're keeping an eye
out for you that you're stuck


1007
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,866
and trying to pull you
in the right direction,


1008
00:50:42,236 --> 00:50:45,546
get you back on track.


1009
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:48,046
And all of these tips that
I've shown you are really just


1010
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:50,006
about anticipating
people's needs.


1011
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:53,546
Telling people what they
need to know in the moment


1012
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:55,376
that they need to know it.


1013
00:50:55,516 --> 00:50:59,206
Think about the restaurant again
that I talked about earlier.


1014
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,106
You don't want to see the
dessert menu before you've been


1015
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,856
seated or while you're
eating your appetizer.


1016
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:06,596
You want it when you
finish your meal.


1017
00:51:07,256 --> 00:51:10,696
And when you have good
service at a restaurant,


1018
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:13,126
it means the wait staff is
there when you need them,


1019
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:14,836
and they're not there
when you don't.


1020
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:18,816
And that's exactly the
approach you want to take


1021
00:51:18,816 --> 00:51:20,816
if you've got help inside
of your application.


1022
00:51:22,436 --> 00:51:24,726
And "Secret" is really
one of the best examples


1023
00:51:24,726 --> 00:51:26,016
that I've seen out there.


1024
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:28,606
It's an anonymous
social networking app.


1025
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,616
So what this means is that you
see posts from your friends,


1026
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:33,996
but you don't know who they are
because everything is anonymous.


1027
00:51:34,806 --> 00:51:37,406
That's a really interesting
way to interact with people.


1028
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:41,896
Now, the first time your feed
loads, they're explaining


1029
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:43,916
in a moment exactly
the information


1030
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:44,656
that you need to know.


1031
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:48,406
So here, I'm scrolling
through my feed,


1032
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:50,736
and I don't know
anyone in the UK.


1033
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:53,436
Oh, it's traveled
across friends.


1034
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:56,426
Speaking of friends,
where are my friends?


1035
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:00,356
Oh, I didn't have
my phone number yet.


1036
00:52:00,946 --> 00:52:04,376
Shoot. And what's the
star mean, I wonder?


1037
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:06,126
It's a popular one.


1038
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:08,066
And when you go to Comments,


1039
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:12,246
they explain why there
are all these icons here.


1040
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:15,536
They're just letting you know
about commenting because that's


1041
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:16,736
where you are in the app.


1042
00:52:17,506 --> 00:52:19,206
They're not telling
you about navigation


1043
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:21,206
or what does the star mean
and things like that -


1044
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:22,676
they're focused on commenting.


1045
00:52:23,876 --> 00:52:25,906
And it's worth noting that
they're just giving one piece


1046
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:29,586
of information at
a time as well.


1047
00:52:29,706 --> 00:52:31,496
And if you're the
first to comment,


1048
00:52:31,766 --> 00:52:35,666
they've populated their
empty view with information.


1049
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:37,666
You know that comments
are going to be there.


1050
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,546
This little gentle push
should be the first one,


1051
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:45,316
and I just love that the
placeholder text encourages you


1052
00:52:45,316 --> 00:52:46,816
to say something kind.


1053
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:48,006
It's great.


1054
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:52,886
So think about what people need
to know based on where they are


1055
00:52:52,886 --> 00:52:56,276
in your app or game, how
long they've been using it,


1056
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,786
and anticipating people's
needs is just another way


1057
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:00,416
that you're going to
be able to provide help


1058
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:02,376
without it feeling like help.


1059
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:08,756
And be sure to take the
opportunity to inspire people


1060
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:11,306
like "Secret" did with
"say something kind."


1061
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:17,246
Now, a lot of people use Siri
to set reminders or send text


1062
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:20,636
or check sports scores,
things like that, but remember


1063
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:22,696
when you found out that
Siri would answer questions


1064
00:53:22,696 --> 00:53:24,066
like this?


1065
00:53:24,616 --> 00:53:27,736
I mean, all of a sudden, this
convenience feature is a source


1066
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:29,226
of entertainment as well.


1067
00:53:30,076 --> 00:53:34,606
It's unexpected and fun, and
now Siri is more valuable to me


1068
00:53:35,356 --> 00:53:37,326
because she's not just
a utility anymore.


1069
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:38,286
She's comedy.


1070
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:39,786
She's flattery.


1071
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:40,836
It's great.


1072
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:45,346
People might come to your app
with a certain expectation


1073
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:49,356
about getting one thing
done, but when they discover


1074
00:53:49,356 --> 00:53:51,126
that your app can
do more for them,


1075
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,926
well then the app becomes
even more valuable.


1076
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:57,806
It's going to feel
like a bonus prize.


1077
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:02,416
And that's why with Siri, we
give you a lot of suggestions


1078
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:03,956
of things that you can ask her.


1079
00:54:04,056 --> 00:54:06,546
You just tap that question
mark button and you're going


1080
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:09,456
to get a long list of things
that you can ask Siri.


1081
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,756
And you may have known that you
can use Siri to initiate calls


1082
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:17,056
or have her make an
appointment on your calendar,


1083
00:54:17,056 --> 00:54:20,216
but did you know that she also
will book restaurants for you


1084
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:22,086
or tell you movie times?


1085
00:54:22,336 --> 00:54:25,036
I mean, this list goes
on, and on and on.


1086
00:54:27,076 --> 00:54:29,376
"Path" does it with some
of their onboarding.


1087
00:54:29,836 --> 00:54:32,956
And they're a private social
network, so they really need you


1088
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:35,086
to register because
everything is oriented


1089
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:36,436
around your personal
information.


1090
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:40,736
But before registering, they're
giving you a series of screens


1091
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:44,176
that covers both the
features of the apps


1092
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:46,886
but also how you might
want to use them.


1093
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,616
A lot of people go to "Path"
thinking they're going to use it


1094
00:54:50,616 --> 00:54:52,456
for work, but now, they're
going to be thinking


1095
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,226
about how they can use it
in their personal life, too.


1096
00:54:57,516 --> 00:55:01,096
Or with Pinterest, they've
got a similar approach.


1097
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:03,236
I mean, maybe you
came to Pinterest


1098
00:55:03,236 --> 00:55:06,296
because you were interested
in nail art or wanting recipes


1099
00:55:06,296 --> 00:55:08,706
for a dinner party, but
now you're also thinking


1100
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:09,806
about gardening.


1101
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:11,716
And then you're thinking


1102
00:55:11,716 --> 00:55:13,846
about what else Pinterest
can be used for.


1103
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:19,106
So step away from that
traditional idea of help,


1104
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:22,006
reference manuals, and think


1105
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:24,366
about how you can
anticipate people's needs.


1106
00:55:25,506 --> 00:55:27,726
Putting instructions
in empty containers


1107
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:30,186
and showing supporting
information inline,


1108
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:33,446
it's about telling people what
they need to know in that moment


1109
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:37,036
that they need to know it
- like the perfect service


1110
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:39,976
in a restaurant, there
when you need them


1111
00:55:39,976 --> 00:55:42,956
and invisible when you don't.


1112
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:45,006
When you're doing all
of that, don't forget


1113
00:55:45,036 --> 00:55:47,166
to take the opportunity
to inspire people,


1114
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:49,056
because that increased
knowledge,


1115
00:55:49,316 --> 00:55:51,286
that increased utility
about your app,


1116
00:55:51,286 --> 00:55:53,566
it's going to mean
increased value.


1117
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:59,386
So if you only take a few things
away from this talk today,


1118
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:04,426
in summary, only require
people to register


1119
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:06,416
when it's absolutely necessary.


1120
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:10,426
Ask yourselves if you really
need onboarding at all.


1121
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:13,056
If they don't need any
information before getting


1122
00:56:13,056 --> 00:56:15,806
started, then just let them
get started, otherwise,


1123
00:56:16,016 --> 00:56:17,496
tell them what they need
to know and then get


1124
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:18,536
out of the way quickly.


1125
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:21,836
Teach through actions
because people are going


1126
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,066
to learn better by doing.


1127
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:28,306
Anticipate people's
needs, and don't forget


1128
00:56:28,306 --> 00:56:30,046
to take the opportunity
to inspire.


1129
00:56:31,206 --> 00:56:34,256
Now, I hope that you'll leave
today with a new impression


1130
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:36,886
about help and how it can
work in your apps or games


1131
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:40,166
and that I hope that I've
inspired you all with how


1132
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:41,766
to make a great first
impression.


1133
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:46,926
So this is my email, and I
would genuinely like to hear


1134
00:56:46,926 --> 00:56:49,326
about changes that
you make to your app


1135
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:51,416
and how that's changed
the overall experience.


1136
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:54,356
We've got a lot more
information about design


1137
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:56,716
at the developer.apple.com.


1138
00:56:57,806 --> 00:57:01,056
And if you didn't see either of
these two sessions on Tuesday,


1139
00:57:01,056 --> 00:57:02,566
the videos are available.


1140
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,776
We've got the "Ingredients
of Great Games," which is


1141
00:57:04,776 --> 00:57:06,596
about making a great game,


1142
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:10,056
and then "Designing Intuitive
User Experiences" has all


1143
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:11,086
of those animation tips.


1144
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:12,406
Thanks so much.


1145
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,016
