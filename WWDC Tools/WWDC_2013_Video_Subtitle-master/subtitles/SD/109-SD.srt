[ Applause ]


3
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,476
>> Hi, I'm Jack Greasley.


4
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,996
I work for The Foundry.


5
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:32,506
And we make software to
do that sort of stuff.


6
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:33,326
It's a pretty cool job.


7
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:37,906
The Foundry was started about
15 years ago by two guys,


8
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:42,256
Bruno and Simon, working out
off a basement in Soho, London.


9
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,216
And they were making
image processing tools


10
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:48,276
for the local film and
visual effects industry.


11
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,716
Since then, we've grown a bit.


12
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:56,066
And we've really made a name
for ourselves by taking tools


13
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:00,176
and technologies out of
visual effects companies,


14
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:03,916
out of animation companies,
and commercializing them


15
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,076
and making them available
to everybody, so with tools


16
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:10,416
like NUKE from Digital
Domain and KATANA


17
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,646
from Sony Pictures Imageworks.


18
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,206
We've taken tools
and technologies


19
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:18,716
which were really only
available to the elite few


20
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,216
and made them available
to everybody.


21
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:23,066
One of the tools that we've done


22
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:25,746
that way is my particular
baby which is MARI.


23
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:32,466
And MARI is a GPU-accelerated
3D digital painting system.


24
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,316
And it was originally developed
at Weta Digital in New Zealand


25
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:39,126
which is Peter Jackson's
visual effects company.


26
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,966
I'm the product manager for MARI


27
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:44,116
but I'm also the
original author.


28
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:46,586
And what I'd like to
do is just take you


29
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:50,356
through just exactly what a
3D digital painting system


30
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,196
actually is.


31
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:56,586
When you're making a movie
and you're making a character


32
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:01,716
like Gollum here, he starts
off as a model, as a mesh.


33
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:04,766
And that model gives
you the overall shape.


34
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,776
It gives you the muscle
and the size of the object.


35
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:11,316
But it lacks the fine-grain
detail on the surface


36
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,116
that really make an
object compelling.


37
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:18,766
And it's the job of a texture
artist to go in there literally


38
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:21,606
with a brush and paint
in individual freckles,


39
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:24,366
individual veins, and
put the detail in there


40
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:27,476
that really makes it, you know,
go from a gray blank model


41
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,706
like this to something
looking pretty good.


42
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:33,876
And if any of you guys have
ever painted any figurines


43
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:37,266
or any models, you know just
how long it can take to get


44
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,546
that looking good and how much
detail you have to put in there.


45
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:44,736
So imagine that your model is
30-feet wide and it's going


46
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:46,926
to be projected on
a screen this size.


47
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:52,176
And this is the problem that
Weta Digital were facing.


48
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:55,346
How do you put enough
detail into your models


49
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:58,336
where the director can choose
to zoom into any part of it


50
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,006
and have it full screen?


51
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:05,286
In a game, you might put,
you know, one or two textures


52
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:08,976
on a character, and they
might be 1,000 pixel square


53
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,686
or 2,000 pixel square.


54
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,406
To get the level of
detail that they needed,


55
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:17,636
Weta Digital would often put
a patchwork of 500 textures


56
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:19,696
over the surface of
a single character.


57
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:23,456
And each of those
textures would be big.


58
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,496
It would be at least
2,000 pixel square


59
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,396
and sometimes much, much bigger.


60
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,216
And it doesn't stop there.


61
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:34,286
Those 500 textures only tell
you one thing about the surface.


62
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:37,316
They only tell you what color
it is, but you also need


63
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:40,256
to tell the system how bumpy
it is, how shiny it is,


64
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,996
how scratchy, how
dirty, how dusty.


65
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,766
And each one of those pieces


66
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:46,356
of information gives you
another 500 textures.


67
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:51,886
So very quickly you can be
up at 10,000 huge textures


68
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,436
for a single character,
and that can be 20, 30,


69
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,016
40 gigabytes of information.


70
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:59,296
And this was slowing
people down.


71
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:00,606
This was slowing
the artists down.


72
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:03,656
The one thing that artists
love to do is paint.


73
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:07,136
Things that they hate doing
are copying data around,


74
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:09,196
renaming files and
managing complexity.


75
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,676
And so, this is really
where MARI comes in.


76
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:17,986
I was hired by Weta
Digital in 2006 to work


77
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:21,126
with their texture artists
to really come up with tools


78
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:22,656
and technologies
to get them back


79
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:25,126
to doing what they
love which is painting.


80
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,146
So I got on a plane from London
down to Wellington, New Zealand


81
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:34,386
and worked with the texture
artists while they were working


82
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:38,296
on this little movie for
James Cameron called Avatar.


83
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:42,636
So my team and I were sitting
next to a room of fifty kind


84
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,916
of busy, kind of
caffeinated texture artists


85
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,406
for about four years.


86
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:51,636
And it got to the point where we
were releasing MARI three times


87
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:51,926
a day.


88
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:55,036
We'd do a version in the morning
and then fix it at lunchtime


89
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,336
and then another one
in the afternoon.


90
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,186
And if releasing three times
a day wasn't, you know,


91
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:02,636
enough work, my brand
new girlfriend


92
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:05,076
at that time was a
texture artist using MARI.


93
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:09,396
It took me a little
while to work out how


94
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,866
to prioritize her bugs properly.


95
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:13,036
[ Laughter ]


96
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:16,116
But I'm glad to say it worked
out and we're still together.


97
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,111
[ Applause ]


98
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:19,546
Thank you.


99
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,031
[ Applause ]


100
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:24,776
So MARI was incredibly
successful at Weta.


101
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:29,036
Every tool-- so every model,
every character, every plant,


102
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:32,576
everything that Weta Digital
painted for Avatar was done


103
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:35,246
in MARI, and that was
several thousand assets.


104
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:38,616
Avatar did OK as well.


105
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:41,796
You know, I think three billion
dollars at the Box Office.


106
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:46,106
And MARI continues to be used
at Weta Digital until today.


107
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,676
Every movie that
they've released


108
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,796
since 2008 has used
MARI as its--


109
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:51,786
as their main texture tool.


110
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:56,086
So this includes things like
The Avengers, The Adventures


111
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:59,106
of Tintin, Rise of the Planet
of the Apes, and most recently,


112
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:03,126
this guy, again, for The Hobbit.


113
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:08,336
In 2010, Weta Digital and The
Foundry came to an agreement


114
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,266
to commercialize MARI.


115
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:12,936
So The Foundry licensed
MARI from Weta.


116
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:15,646
But what that really
meant is that they sold it


117
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,016
and they sold me along with it.


118
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:21,676
So I got on a plane from
Wellington, New Zealand back


119
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,306
to London which is 32
hours door-to-door.


120
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,306
And this time, I was
coming back with a USB stick


121
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:33,405
for the source code and an
invoice for The Foundry to sign.


122
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,756
My role at The Foundry
was simple.


123
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:38,866
We wanted to make MARI
the industry standard


124
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,926
for visual effects,
3D digital painting.


125
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:46,586
Over the last three
years, we've done that.


126
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,826
We've been incredibly successful
to the point that nine


127
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:50,526
out of ten of the
movies nominated


128
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:53,176
for visual effects
Oscars this year used MARI


129
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:54,866
as their main texture
painting system.


130
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,326
The only reason that
the tenth didn't is


131
00:08:57,326 --> 00:08:59,426
that they didn't buy it in time
enough to use on the movie.


132
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:03,936
MARI is at use-- in
use at a whole bunch


133
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,056
of companies you
will have heard of,


134
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:07,756
so there's Industrial Light
& Magic over in the Presidio,


135
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:10,616
DreamWorks Animations,
Sony Pictures Imageworks.


136
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,526
So really if you've seen a movie
over the last couple of years


137
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:16,656
in which there has been an
alien, a spaceship, a monster,


138
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,006
something blowing up,
you've seen MARI at work.


139
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:22,756
One of the really
great things though


140
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:25,566
about taking an in-house
tool something thats design


141
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,216
for one specific task and making
it available to everybody is


142
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:33,416
that you start seeing uses
that you never expected for it.


143
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,166
We've seen it cropping up
in games, in architecture,


144
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,906
in digital design, and even
in amazing artwork like this


145
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,296
which is from an album cover.


146
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:45,846
One of our most technically
innovative artists is a good


147
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,816
friend of mine called Scott
Metzger who works out of LA.


148
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:51,466
And he's coming up with
new novel techniques


149
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:54,206
for capturing digital
environments


150
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:58,226
and making photorealistic
rendering incredibly easy to do.


151
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:01,656
So what this really means is
Scott went out one weekend


152
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:04,116
and rented an industrial
laser scanner


153
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:07,176
and started scanning things,
and he scanned his apartment.


154
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:11,106
And he scanned it down
to millimeter accuracy.


155
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:15,396
And ran around his apartment
with a camera taking hundreds


156
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:19,166
and hundreds of reference
photographs making this enormous


157
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:23,146
dataset which he pulled
into MARI and used MARI


158
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:24,986
to paint those photos down onto


159
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:26,686
to this enormous
scan that he made.


160
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,296
And this created-- I think
it was a 20 gigabyte dataset


161
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:33,106
that he was able to
fly around inside


162
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,716
of MARI, edit in real time.


163
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:40,466
But it also meant that he could
make amazing photorealistic


164
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:41,656
renderings like this.


165
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:45,086
You can actually zoom down
into the work surfaces


166
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,186
and you can see fingerprints,


167
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:50,156
you can see fine-grained
detail in the paint work.


168
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:54,056
And this is an incredibly
useful thing


169
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:56,866
for the visual effects
industry and the film industry


170
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:58,226
because when you're
making a film,


171
00:10:58,226 --> 00:11:01,756
what you normally do
is you build a set,


172
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:05,566
you put some cameras on the set,
you get the actors on the set,


173
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,736
you film it, and then the set
gets torn down and thrown away.


174
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,986
But what often happens
is two months later,


175
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,056
the director has this
flash of inspiration


176
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,036
that the thing that's
really going


177
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:21,006
to give him the Oscar this
time is a zoom through this set


178
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,926
which is now sitting somewhere
in a dumpster in Hollywood.


179
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,736
And these are called
pickup shots,


180
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,676
and they're incredibly
expensive to do.


181
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:31,516
You need to go and find the
bits of set that still exists,


182
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:32,636
you need to rebuild the set,


183
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:34,046
you need to reconstruct
the lighting,


184
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:35,946
you need to match
everything perfectly.


185
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:40,386
But with this technique, you
can actually capture the set


186
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,176
and its entirety, all
of the information,


187
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,216
all the lighting,
when you're shooting.


188
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:47,406
And when the director has this
amazing flash of inspiration,


189
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:50,786
it's then incredibly cheap
to do pickup shots rather


190
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:52,426
than incredibly expensive.


191
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:57,046
All of the examples
that I've shown


192
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:59,816
up until now have been
running on Windows and Linux.


193
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,636
But MARI was originally
developed for the first couple


194
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:07,286
of years of its life on
both Macintosh and Linux.


195
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:09,126
Unfortunately, as I mentioned,


196
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:11,276
we were releasing
three times a day


197
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,856
and maintaining six builds a day


198
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,036
in full production was really
more than we could deal with.


199
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,746
So we concentrated
on Linux at the time,


200
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,456
but I'm incredibly pleased that
MARI is actually coming back


201
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:23,126
to the Mac later this summer.


202
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:24,936
Thank you.


203

[ Applause ]


204
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:30,336
We've been developing on


205
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,376
and targeting common
generation Mac hardware.


206
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,796
And partially this
is really selfish.


207
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,556
I want to demo on my brand new
shiny retina Macbook Pro and not


208
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:42,406
on a big ugly laptop
I've got at the moment.


209
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:48,026
The porting process for us has
been pretty straightforward.


210
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,376
It's really just
some housekeeping.


211
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:52,426
We need to take MARI's
OpenGL usage


212
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:54,376
because it really is
fully OpenGL based


213
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:58,066
and update it to
3.2 core profile.


214
00:12:58,756 --> 00:12:59,876
This is something
we've been meaning


215
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:00,866
to do for a while anyway.


216
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,476
It really gives us a
lot of benefits in terms


217
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:05,896
of performance, speed,


218
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:07,906
simplicity of code
and stability.


219
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:11,326
And it's taken us
about six weeks to go


220
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:13,976
from absolutely nothing, MARI
didn't compile on the Mac,


221
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:17,916
didn't run on the Mac, to
being able to demo here today


222
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,746
which you guys will be
seeing in a few minutes.


223
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:24,556
The screenshots you can see
on the screen were taken


224
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:26,466
about a week apart
by my developers


225
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,166
as they were bringing MARI up.


226
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,866
The first image is the
first time MARI ran


227
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,046
on the Mac in five years.


228
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,056
The second one is a week later.


229
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:36,456
We have rendering
up and working.


230
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:40,896
And the third one is a week
after that where we're dealing


231
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:45,936
with big datasets we can
paint and we can animate.


232
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,816
So it really has been a
pretty seamless process.


233
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:52,706
However, we have been incredibly
lucky during this whole


234
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,246
process-- have been given
access to the new Mac Pro.


235
00:13:56,496 --> 00:14:00,886
We originally designed MARI
with multiple GPUs in mind.


236
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:05,486
For me it makes so much sense
that you're going to want


237
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,496
to be processing
huge amounts of data


238
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,886
on one device while you're
displaying it fluidly


239
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:12,396
at 60 frames per
second on a second.


240
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,896
However, we've not really
ever seen a viable platform


241
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,296
for us to do this before.


242
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:20,936
We don't see multiple
GPUs installed


243
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,556
in visual effects
artist machines.


244
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:25,696
We see it in the
gaming world, you know,


245
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,646
people who put two GPUs
in their gaming rig


246
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,686
so they can play Gears
of War at 1080p 60 hertz.


247
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:35,156
But that power has never
been available to artists.


248
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:40,036
The multiple GPUs in the new
Mac Pro especially combined


249
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:41,286
with the updated OpenGL


250
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:45,876
and OpenCL support makes
it just a dream platform


251
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:46,766
for us to develop on it.


252
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:49,996
It's been really a
fantastic experience.


253
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,316
It's also going to make
my life a lot easier.


254
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:56,786
A large part of my job
is actually working


255
00:14:56,786 --> 00:15:00,356
with our most demanding
customers to help them design


256
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:04,246
and build systems that
will meet their, you know,


257
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:05,936
incredible requirements.


258
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,586
I often get emails in the
morning along the lines of,


259
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:11,376
"So Jack, we tried to load
250 gigs of data into MARI


260
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:12,616
and it's running a
little bit slowly.


261
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:13,396
What can we do?"


262
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:17,546
So this machine is going to
make my life really easy.


263
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,956

the new Mac Pro."

[ Laughter ]


265
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:27,686
I can genuinely say it is the
best out-of-the-box experience


266
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:29,446
I've ever seen with MARI.


267
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:34,626
In terms of our most
demanding customers,


268
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:39,916
I think Pixar Animation Studios
are right up there with them.


269
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,736
I love working with
them as a company


270
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,656
because they represent
this amazing fusion


271
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:44,986
of being deeply artistic


272
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,036
but at the same time
being deeply technical.


273
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:51,626
Pixar were a very--
early adopter of MARI.


274
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:55,166
And we've been working with them
for the last, about three years,


275
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:57,576
to integrate MARI
into their pipeline


276
00:15:57,576 --> 00:16:00,196
to put together new techniques


277
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:02,836
for creating incredibly
realistic characters


278
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,156
for their upcoming movies.


279
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:08,316

Jonathan Hoffman here today

who's a shading technical
artist from Pixar.


281

Using MARI on the new Mac Pro,


282
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:16,886
he's going to be giving us a
sneak peak behind the scenes


283

into the process of how Pixar
design and build the characters

that are going to their movies.


285
00:16:22,676 --> 00:16:25,076
But before we do that, I think
we should have a quick look


286
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,126
at some of the amazing work
that they've been up to


287

obviously since this is a

to the world of Monsters Inc.

which we haven't
been to since 2001.


325
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:20,676
And recreating that world, you
know, we wanted to stay true

to the essence of the design
while still pushing the limits

of what we can do
now that it's 2013.

Obviously the technology has
come a long way since then.

like teenagers, and that
might be more difficult


335
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:46,286
than you would think because how
exactly does one make a walking

00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,856
You don't normally think
about this sort of thing.


338
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:55,436
But the people in the art team
did an amazing job in figuring


339
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:58,186
out and envisioning, you know,
how you take these monsters


340
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:59,086
and make them look younger.


341
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,376
With Mike Wazowski, this image
by our production designer,


342
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:05,296
Ricky, is this great
progression of Mike all the way


343
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:06,956
from toddler to adulthood.


344
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:10,366
And this is the final design
for both of the main characters.


345
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:12,836
And there's a lot of
real subtle things here.


346
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,696
I'm going to kind of show you
some of the things that they did


347
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:15,696
to make them look younger.


348
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:20,476
With Mike Wazowski, you know,
we took lots of pictures of all


349
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:22,876
of the people of the
studio and looked at them


350
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,396
when they were teenagers
and then looked


351
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,276
at their adult pictures.


352
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,296
And we learned a few things,
you know, besides, you know,


353
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,546
we all are, you know, little
bit less hair, you know,


354
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,376
some things like that.


355
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:36,666
But with teenagers, teenagers
reach their adult height way


356
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,056
before they really fill in.


357
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:40,326
And so with Mike, you'll
notice he's the same height


358
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:40,986
as he was before.


359
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:42,216
His limbs are the same length.


360
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,226
His hands and his feet
are the same size.


361
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:45,746
But he's a lot skinnier, right?


362
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:46,556
He's lanky.


363
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:49,376
And there's a lot
of other things too.


364
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:53,536
The colors are much more vibrant
and saturated to give them


365
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:54,616
that sort of youthful glow.


366
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:57,446
The horns are shorter
and more blunted because,


367
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:00,946
obviously as you get older,
your horns get longer.


368
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,756
And with Mike, you know,
you've got this great detail


369
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,976
of that retainer just coming
out of high school, you know.


370
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:08,386
I'm sure a lot of you
had to deal with that.


371
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:10,486
And then with Sullivan,


372
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:14,996
my favorite detail is he's
got this great bedhead look.


373
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:17,536
But since it's all over his
body, it's his bed-body look.


374
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,766
It looks like he just
rolled out of bed and all


375
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:20,676
of his hair is disheveled.


376
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:24,466
So a lot of thought and
time and effort goes


377
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:27,976
into really making these
character designs perfect


378
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:30,986
for these characters,
to really stay true


379
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,956
to that original design
but really take them


380
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:34,436
in a new direction
for this film.


381
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:38,646
But for every main character,
for every, you know, for these--


382
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,476
our core characters,
we need a good foil,


383
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,496
we need a good antagonist
for the story.


384
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:45,046
And so, I'm going to
introduce you to the character


385
00:20:45,046 --> 00:20:47,096
that I have the chance to work
on for this film and I'm going


386
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:50,416
to show you a never before
seen clip from the movie


387
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,896
to introduce that character.


388
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,446
>> Please, let me
try the simulator.


389
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:56,416
I'll surprise you.


390
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,126
>> Surprise me?


391
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,096
I doubt that very much.


392
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:05,846
>> All right, so that
is Dean Hardscrabble


393
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:08,006
of the Monsters University
School of Scaring.


394
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:11,246
Now, she is the scariest
monster on campus.


395
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,166
And she is a scaring legend.


396
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,676
And with a character like
this, where does it start?


397
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:19,506
How does a character go
from start to finish?


398
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:20,316
Where does it begin?


399
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,356
Well it starts with
a bunch of drawings.


400
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,996
The art team does hundreds
of drawings for weeks to try


401
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:28,376
and really figure out
what a character is,


402
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:30,546
to experiment with
different ideas.


403
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:34,416
And with Hardscrabble, they
had a very challenging goal.


404
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,766
They needed her to be
very poised and elegant


405
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:39,376
and have this sense
of authority.


406
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:42,066
But they also needed
her to be terrifying.


407
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,976
And they were trying a bunch of
different ideas but it wasn't


408
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:49,656
until they saw this video
of a Amazonian centipede


409
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,216
which these things are huge.


410
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:52,776
It's a giant Amazonian
centipede.


411
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:57,466
They saw this video and
it had this amazing grace


412
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,386
to it despite the fact
that the first things


413
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,316
that you see is "Wow,
that is scary.


414
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:03,966
I'm going to"-- you know, if you
see that you want to run away.


415
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:07,746
But you see it and it had this
movement, this deadly grace


416
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:09,776
to it, and that is
exactly what they wanted


417
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:10,666
for Dean Hardscrabble.


418
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,546
So the director, Dan Scanlon,
drew the centipede tail


419
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:14,596
onto the back of Hardscrabble


420
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,196
and they realized
that is the design.


421
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,566
That was the central
part of her visual look.


422
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:23,926
So this is the final design by
Jason Deamer and it really--


423
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,296
the central figure of the
design is that centipede,


424
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:30,766
but then he's incorporated all
these other really scary animals


425
00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:31,776
into that design.


426
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:35,276
She's got these bat wings, the
sort of dragon/lizard head.


427
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:39,226
And this, you know,
this was the character


428
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:42,186
that they've been searching
for, this elegance and grace,


429
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,456
authority along with
this idea of being very,


430
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:48,386
very scary and terrifying.


431
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:52,336
The first film, we had a--


432
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:55,376
you know, we had this cast of
very candy colored characters,


433
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:59,736
these very bright, you know,
and saturated characters.


434
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:02,696
And with the next film, we
wanted to stay true to that.


435
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:06,476
But with Hardscrabble, we needed
to make sure that she still fit


436
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:08,576
in the world of all these
other characters and


437
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:09,536
yet was still scarier.


438
00:23:09,976 --> 00:23:12,126
In Monsters Incorporated, if
you remember the character


439
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,636
of Waternoose, he was
a little bit different.


440
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:16,016
And so we were trying to go
for something similar to him


441
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:18,486
where he still fit in the
world but was different


442
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:19,286
than all the other characters.


443
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:22,036
She again needed to be
scarier and yet still feel


444
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,176
like she came from
the same planet.


445
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:27,816
So once the design is settled,
it really gets passed in to kind


446
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:28,876
of two different areas.


447
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:32,736
The first is the modeling
department where, in this case,


448
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:35,586
Michael Honsel took this
design and began to sculpt it


449
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:38,946
on the computer, very much
how he would sculpt an object


450
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:40,306
in real life in real clay.


451
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,386
But he's sculpting it
digitally on the computer.


452
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:45,476
But it also gets passed to the
art department again to start


453
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:48,056
to develop the textural
look of the character.


454
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:52,446
And so this is a painting by
Shelly Wan and it was given


455
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:55,606
to me to show me,
OK, this is the way


456
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:57,926
that the surface should look
when it's reacting to light.


457
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:00,726
This is how the character
needs to look


458
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:03,016
in color and with specularity.


459
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:05,076
And I'll explain some of
the details of that later.


460
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:07,476
And so we've got
this beautiful image.


461
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:11,816
And along with this image comes
a bunch of reference photography


462
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:15,086
of the different creatures that
make up what Hardscrabble is.


463
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,676
And so, we we start with
her makeup, you know,


464
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:20,276
and all these little
great details


465
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:22,026
about what her face makeup
is going to look like.


466
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:24,396
But then we moved into
her different aspects


467
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,416
like the horns, how those
are going to be shaped,


468
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,846
what the colors are going
to be, how shiny they are.


469
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:30,566
And we go through
all of these details


470
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,626
of these different aspects.


471
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:34,526
But one of the things about
her shells and her legs,


472
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:38,056
with a centipede that's only
this big, I mean only this big,


473
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,276
it has this sort of
translucency to it


474
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,426
but that would give her a
sense of being very small.


475
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:47,536
So instead of going with the
insect variety of shells,


476
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:49,206
we went with more
of a crustacean look


477
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:51,766
because that would indicate
a larger scale creature.


478
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,046
So we have these great images
of her legs, of the shells,


479
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:58,366
and also these great
batwings and the translucency


480
00:24:58,366 --> 00:24:59,696
that we could get
with the batwings.


481
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:00,836
All these things
were thought about.


482
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:05,756
But with this photography-- with
these images, I wasn't supposed


483
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:09,496
to take them and make a
photorealistic character.


484
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:13,816
The goal at Pixar is never to
go with just loads and loads


485
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,186
of detail and just make
it look like a creature


486
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:19,246
because we've hit this area
called "Uncanny Valley".


487
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:22,136
It's something we try to avoid
very much where you've added


488
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:25,736
so much detail that it
looks too realistic.


489
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:30,126
And at Pixar, we want to find
the essence of these designs.


490
00:25:30,126 --> 00:25:32,366
We want to boil it down
to its simplest idea


491
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,576
and then really pull
that idea out.


492
00:25:34,806 --> 00:25:36,926
And so with all these
photography, I was supposed


493
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:39,326
to take inspiration
but not copy exactly.


494
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:42,166
I was supposed to
find that simple idea.


495
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:44,786
So, the next thing
that we're going


496
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:49,116
to do is actually demonstrate
the process of how I began


497
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:50,776
to paint this character
on the computer.


498
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:54,696
Now, bear with me
because this is, you know,


499
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:56,906
the new Mac Pro,
it's unreleased.


500
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:59,756
We're running on an unreleased
OS and the software, MARI,


501
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:01,446
has only been on the
Mac for about six weeks.


502
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:03,736
So, what could possibly
go wrong, right?


503
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,706
So it'll be exciting
for me, hopefully,


504
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:08,606
exciting for you
as well to do this.


505
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:10,566
So, all right.


506
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,546
So this is the new Mac Pro


507
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:14,806
and this is MARI running
on the new Mac Pro.


508
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,566
And this is how I get the model
from the modeling department.


509
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:18,256
It's gray.


510
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:20,936
It doesn't have any detail
yet because it's my job


511
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:22,726
to add the detail
to the character.


512
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:25,266
So I'm going to navigate around
and you can see, you know,


513
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,436
this is a 3D model
brought in to the computer.


514
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:31,196
And the first thing that I do
when I'm creating a character,


515
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:32,656
when I'm starting to
paint in the detail,


516
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:34,916
is I start with the big
details and then I move


517
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,226
into the smaller details.


518
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:39,106
So for her, I'm going to start
with the color and I'm going


519
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:44,196
to start with her base color,
basically her flat base color.


520
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:46,266
So she's more of this
color than anything else.


521
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:47,306
So this is where
I'm going to start.


522
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:50,576
And the first big read that
I got from that shader packet


523
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:53,556
that I showed you earlier
is that her horns are sort


524
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:55,316
of different material
than her face.


525
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,486
It's a darker shell.


526
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,216
And so, I'm going to
paint in a little bit


527
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:00,486
of that variation first.


528
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:03,376
And I'm going to be a little
bit rough and sloppy here


529
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:06,356
because I'm compressing
a couple--


530
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:08,736
I would at least want to work on
this character for a few weeks


531
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,666
and I'm going to compress
that into about 15 minutes.


532
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:15,126
So I apologize if I'm a
little bit sloppy with this.


533
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:17,716
So I'm grabbing a brush,
and this is very similar


534
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,456
to a program like Photoshop
where you have a bunch


535
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:21,826
of different brushes that
can do different things.


536
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:23,796
And I'm just going to
start painting right


537
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:26,066
onto this model if I can.


538
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:27,506
Let's see.


539
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:30,836
Again, live demo, I apologize.


540
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:33,216
All right, here we go.


541
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:36,846
So I'm painting straight onto
this model and you can see


542
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:38,266
that it's, you know,
accepting this paint


543
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:40,416
and I'm getting a nice
gradient towards her horns.


544
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,736
I'm just trying to
lay in, you know,


545
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:44,586
a nice amount of detail here.


546
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,556
I'm going to move the camera
and that paint is going


547
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:49,396
to be dropped onto the model.


548
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:50,936
So you can see it's
actually been projected


549
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:51,806
through the model here.


550
00:27:51,806 --> 00:27:56,996
I'm just going to add a little
bit more from this angle.


551
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,786
Then I'm going to go in and
do a little bit more detail


552
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:04,816
on one of these horns.


553
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,746
Now, again, I'm trying
to lay in some


554
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:11,636
of the bigger base details
first and then I'll start moving


555
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:12,796
into the smaller details.


556
00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:15,016
You never want to start
with small details.


557
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,456
And any artist will
tell you this,


558
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:19,656
"If you start painting the
eyelashes before you've really,


559
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,286
you know, figured out
the shape of the head,


560
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,086
you're doing something wrong."


561
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:26,166
So I'm starting with the
big broad strokes first.


562
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:29,496
And this horn, if you remember
that image from the lizard,


563
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:32,876
it had some really nice
striations that kind


564
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,386
of ran along the horn.


565
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:38,886
And so, I'm going to start
painting some of those in.


566
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:42,766
But I don't want to go-- I
don't want to go too detailed.


567
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:43,866
I'm trying to keep this--


568
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:47,696
these shapes graphic
and really strong here,


569
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:51,696
get that simple idea
without going into, you know,


570
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,946
all those tiny little
nitty-gritties.


571
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,146
So I'm just rotating
this around.


572
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,466
Now, you'll notice that
this feels very liquid.


573
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,896
It feels very smooth, right?


574
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:06,166
As I'm tumbling,
it's so responsive.


575
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:09,136
And this really feels just
like I've got an object,


576
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:11,756
a model in my hand and I'm just
turning it and painting it.


577
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,116
And the way-- the reason that
that's possible is two things.


578
00:29:14,116 --> 00:29:16,616
First, MARI is very,
very slick at allowing me


579
00:29:16,716 --> 00:29:17,706
to see all these detail.


580
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:20,086
But secondly, it's
really so responsive


581
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:22,346
because the hardware is
supporting it is so well.


582
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:26,036
It's just-- you know, I forget
that I'm painting on a computer


583
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:27,496
and it feels like I'm
painting in real life


584
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:30,706
which is exactly what
I want as an artist.


585
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:32,676
So I painted this first horn.


586
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:35,046
I'm relatively satisfied
with it.


587
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,776
As with everything, as an
artist, I'd want to sit here


588
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,626
and noodle it for an hour.


589
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,006
But I'm going to skip
ahead, not bore you


590
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:42,296
with painting the
rest of these horns.


591
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:45,036
So I'll just-- this is another
layer here that shows you,


592
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:47,546
you know, the same treatment
to all these other horns.


593
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:51,976
And now as I zoom back, you get
that first pass at her color.


594
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:53,566
Like if you were to see
her from this far away,


595
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:54,776
she looks pretty good.


596
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,956
This is the biggest
read of the character.


597
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:58,876
But her skin is way
too simple, right?


598
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:01,966
Every-- all skin
has variety to it.


599
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,596
It has mottling and
freckles and--


600
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:06,686
you know, even the most perfect
person has a large amount


601
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:07,936
of variation in their skin.


602
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:10,206
If they look like this,
they look like a mannequin.


603
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:13,636
So I'm going to start adding
in some variety to her skin.


604
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:18,136
And I'm not-- you know, I
don't want to go too far again


605
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,566
because I don't want to
make her look grotesque.


606
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,926
But I want her to look--
I want her to look old.


607
00:30:22,926 --> 00:30:26,646
She needs to be sort of this
figure of wisdom and authority.


608
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:30,076
And so, I need her to kind
of feel like she's had some,


609
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:32,106
you know, had some years,
had some experience.


610
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:38,136
Not exactly sure how quickly
lizard, centipede, bats age,


611
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:42,356
but, you know, she's got to
look a little bit lived-in.


612
00:30:42,546 --> 00:30:47,166
So I'm just going to add in some
basic variety to her skin here.


613
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:49,596
You know, MARI comes
with these, you know,


614
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:51,746
a lot of really great brushes
that I can kind of start with


615
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:53,886
and lay on some detail.


616
00:30:58,326 --> 00:31:00,356
Add some freckles, a
little bit of darkening.


617
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:01,966
And I can put some stuff on


618
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:04,386
and then pull it off
if I've gone too far.


619
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:05,696
That's nice.


620
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:13,926
Paint some freckles in
the back of her neck here.


621
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:17,686
It's always interesting,
the back of people's arms,


622
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:19,696
the back of people's necks
always get a little bit dark


623
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:20,906
and I'm not sure if
that's because of--


624
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:23,196
you know, that you just
get more sun there,


625
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:25,676
if the skin is a bit
more aged in those areas,


626
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:26,886
but it always seems that way.


627
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:29,906
It's one of those
things you start staring


628
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:33,876
at people differently when
you've been painting, you know?


629
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:36,566
And on creatures and humans
and characters for a long time,


630
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,116
you just-- you're
staring at someone's--


631
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,106
you know, the back of their
leg for whatever reason


632
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,056
and they're thinking, you
know, "What's he doing?


633
00:31:42,056 --> 00:31:42,976
Why is he looking at me?"


634
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:45,136
And it's just because there's
this really cool vein doing this


635
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:45,906
really cool thing.


636
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:49,526
And it's not, you know, I'm
not trying to be insulting,


637
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,476
it's just that I'm
fascinated by it, right?


638
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,936
Because I'm going to use it to--


639
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:55,756
on the next day when I'm
painting this character.


640
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,226
So, anyway.


641
00:31:57,676 --> 00:32:00,276
I hope I haven't
offended too many people.


642
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:04,956
Anyway, so I'm OK with
where she is right now.


643
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:05,936
And I want to talk a little bit


644
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:08,196
about how MARI is
storing this data.


645
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,736
You know, Jack gave you
a really great overview


646
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,426
of what MARI does, and we're
going to get in a little bit


647
00:32:12,426 --> 00:32:14,326
into the nuts and bolts
as I'm demonstrating here


648
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:16,166
without being too technical


649
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,096
because I don't really
understand all the nuts


650
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:18,756
and bolts.


651
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,846
So you can see what
I've been painting


652
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:24,956
on the left side is mirrored
over here on the right side.


653
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:27,906
And what we're looking
at here is a series


654
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,886
of slightly disturbing images


655
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:35,256
where the character has been
flattened out or kind of pelted


656
00:32:35,256 --> 00:32:36,956
into these tiles, right?


657
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,716
And what these tiles represent,


658
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,436
each one represents
a single color image,


659
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,276
just like an image you
would take on your phone.


660
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,746
And these images keep
all of that color data


661
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:47,486
that I've been painting.


662
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:48,506
And they can be scaled


663
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:50,906
to whatever amount
of detail you need.


664
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:54,426
So for a video game, they'd be
down at like 256 pixel squared


665
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,516
which is pretty small.


666
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:57,226
But for a feature film,


667
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:59,876
you never know how much
detail you're going to need.


668
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:04,226
So these are actually 8,000
pixels by 8,000 pixels.


669
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:08,556
That's 33 times bigger
than an HD frame


670
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:09,876
from a movie, all right?


671
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:12,556
But the reason you need that
is because you never know


672
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:14,546
if the character is going to
walk right past the camera


673
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:16,726
and we're going to
see all of this detail


674
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,296
on one of these legs, right?


675
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:19,566
And that actually
happened in the film.


676
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,626
She walks right past the camera.


677
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:25,066
So we really need this level
of fidelity to make sure


678
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,596
that she holds up in any
situation that she shows up in.


679
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:31,206
So, the next thing I'm going
to do and the reason why I came


680
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:34,956
into this view is to show you
how I would paint her makeup.


681
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:37,146
And I painted on
the flat version


682
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,566
because it's a little
bit easier than trying


683
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:39,816
to work around the 3D shape.


684
00:33:40,136 --> 00:33:41,186
But as I paint on the right,


685
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,656
you'll see that it
updates on the left.


686
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,826
So I'm going to grab this
great eye shadow color.


687
00:33:45,826 --> 00:33:49,896
Now, a couple of weeks
ago, we had the wrap party


688
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:53,546
where the movie is-- the movie
is finished and we all go


689
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:55,346
to see it for the first
time and we dress up.


690
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:57,666
And my wife usually gets her
makeup professionally done.


691
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,496
But I told her, "Honey, I
painted makeup before, you know.


692
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,226
I do it for work.


693
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:03,906
It's not a big deal.


694
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:04,936
I can handle it."


695
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,056
So, I painted her makeup,
I painted her eye shadow.


696
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:09,706
I thought it looked
great, you know?


697
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:11,286
I thought I did this great job.


698
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:15,545
She looks in the mirror, was
not pleased with my efforts.


699
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:18,946
So, we ended up being about
half an hour late to the movie.


700
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:20,846
Well we made it before
the movie.


701
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:21,976
We're half an hour
late to the party.


702
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:23,556
So we made it for
the important part,


703
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:26,755
but I doubt she'll trust me to
do her makeup again after that.


704
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:28,946
I guess, you know, painting


705
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:31,275
on monsters doesn't
necessarily transfer directly


706
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:33,516
over to painting on humans.


707
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:35,386
Would never have guessed.


708
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:38,036
Anyway, so I'm painting
this sweet purple eye shadow


709
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:38,856
onto this character.


710
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:40,485
And you can see,
again, as I'm painting


711
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:41,806
on the right it's
updating on the left.


712
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:48,456
And-- So what we've got
here is basically two views


713
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:49,196
of the same thing.


714
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:52,436
So now I've done that, I'm
going to just go ahead and visit


715
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:54,496
on the other side of--
I've got another layer


716
00:34:54,496 --> 00:34:56,906
that has her makeup
on the other side.


717
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:59,406
I always forget character
right or my right.


718
00:35:00,986 --> 00:35:03,446
Guess-- I guessed right, great.


719
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,006
I'm not even going to
bother with her lipstick.


720
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,066
Painting lipstick for me is


721
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,066
like when your four-year-old
daughter tries


722
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,516
to paint her lipstick
for the first time,


723
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:11,406
I've never gotten past


724
00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:13,186
that because I just
don't do it often enough.


725
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,846
Anyway, so we've
got her makeup done,


726
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:17,376
and her skin color looks good.


727
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:20,276
But it's still lacking
some that detail


728
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:21,366
that we saw from the packet.


729
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:23,196
Now, this is the color channel


730
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:25,396
and I've got some nice
variety to her color.


731
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:29,026
But with every character
in a 3D film,


732
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:32,076
there are multiple channels
that define different parts


733
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:33,326
of what the character
looks like.


734
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:35,196
So this is the slide
from the shader packet


735
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:37,916
that shows me what the
characters look like,


736
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,866
what the character's face
looks like in more detail.


737
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:42,396
And there's some really
graphic shapes to her wrinkles


738
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:46,346
and to the, you know,
the shape of her face,


739
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:47,456
more than just the color.


740
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:50,476
And so we would actually paint
that on a separate channel.


741
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:53,486
It would be on what we call the
bump or the displacement map.


742
00:35:53,636 --> 00:35:56,056
And that's a grayscale
channel that defines


743
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:58,366
where the wrinkles go in
and where things bump out.


744
00:35:58,776 --> 00:36:01,686
And so, I'm going to show you
how I would do that over here.


745
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:06,986
So, here we're starting with a
color and I'm going to switch


746
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:09,196
over to the bump channel.


747
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:11,976
It starts out with this--


748
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:14,176
you know, just this
gray solid image.


749
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:18,276
And the first thing I'm going
to do is flood in some texture,


750
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:22,366
flood in just this
basic leather variety.


751
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:25,756
Now, it looks good but it
doesn't have the specificity


752
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:29,176
that we'd really want for this
character to match that artwork,


753
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:30,086
that beautiful artwork.


754
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:34,966
So the first thing that I'm
going to do is actually bring


755
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,166
in a picture of an elephant.


756
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:39,246
So this is the side of an
elephant as you can see.


757
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,756
And I'm actually going to
use that to paint through


758
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:46,816
and get some wrinkles on the
surface of this character.


759
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:48,026
So I'm going to start
with her eye.


760
00:36:49,196 --> 00:36:52,936
And I'm trying to find the right
angle to paint through because


761
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,626
with wrinkles, if you look at
some with really wrinkly skin,


762
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:57,376
none of the wrinkles
are arbitrary.


763
00:36:57,376 --> 00:37:01,216
All of them flow exactly
where the skin would fold


764
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:02,366
and compress over time.


765
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:05,516
And so, I can't just
paint these willy-nilly.


766
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,656
I have to really make sure


767
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:09,906
that they are feeling what we
would call motivated, right?


768
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:12,666
That they would be--
they would be naturally


769
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,216
where the character
would be wrinkling.


770
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:15,846
Now, this is obviously
a made up character.


771
00:37:15,846 --> 00:37:18,236
But the character still has
to feel believable, right?


772
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:20,726
If this character
creature were to exist,


773
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,726
how would she wrinkle
in her face?


774
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:25,086
So, I'm good with these.


775
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:26,716
I'm going to zoom out.


776
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:27,456
And this is one of my--


777
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:30,526
it's really one of my
favorite features in MARI


778
00:37:30,576 --> 00:37:34,166
because I can get so much detail
so rapidly onto the character.


779
00:37:34,596 --> 00:37:36,396
And so I'm just going to paint
some of these wrinkles in.


780
00:37:36,396 --> 00:37:38,486
And again, since this is
the black and white map,


781
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:40,436
it's really hard to tell
it how this is going


782
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:42,216
to affect the final
look of the character.


783
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:43,706
And I'll get more
into that later.


784
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:46,286
But this is, you know,
this is where we start


785
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:49,156
from in getting a lot
of this detail in.


786
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:51,596
There's this great spot on
the texture that looks just


787
00:37:51,596 --> 00:37:54,136
like forehead, if I can find it.


788
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,586
Right about-- I'm upside down.


789
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:57,716
There we go.


790
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,656
So the next image that I'm
actually going to pull in came


791
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:06,486
from a picture that
I took on my iPhone


792
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:07,676
from the Pixar parking lot.


793
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:08,756
There are these trees there.


794
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,036
You can the tire of
my car over here.


795
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:15,746
These trees there that spray sap
in all the cars for some reason,


796
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,476
and I'm not sure, you know, why.


797
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:21,196
But I was walking into work and
I saw the texture on the side


798
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:23,036
and I just stared at it,
like, you know, weirdo.


799
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:23,756
I'm like, wow.


800
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,616
That texture looks really cool.


801
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:26,726
I'm not sure what I'm
going to use it for.


802
00:38:26,726 --> 00:38:29,596
So I took the picture and then
I realized it was actually this


803
00:38:29,646 --> 00:38:33,816
really perfect way to transition
from the organic leather


804
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:36,466
on the front of her face
to the more hardened shells


805
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:37,336
on the side of her head.


806
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:40,666
So, I really loved it for
that particular purpose.


807
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,926
Though when I took the
picture, I had no idea


808
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:45,086
when I was going to use it.


809
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:48,706
Again, I'm trying to get sort
of this material transition


810
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,136
because we're talking about
two different textures here.


811
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,786
This, again, is one
of my favorite parts


812
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:58,466
because I can really paint in
as much detail as I would like.


813
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:02,706
Now, so we've got these shapes
and it's starting to feel good


814
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:04,466
but it's still in the realm


815
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:06,886
of being a bit too
photorealistic, right?


816
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:10,036
We could be moving into Uncanny
Valley here if I'm not careful


817
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:12,616
with all of this photo
detail that I'm using.


818
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,296
And so, the next thing that
I would do is actually start


819
00:39:16,296 --> 00:39:20,146
to paint on top of this
to really nail the details


820
00:39:20,146 --> 00:39:23,276
down the way that-- the way
that it was in the art packet.


821
00:39:24,836 --> 00:39:27,126
So, let's see.


822
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:31,176
I remember from the packet there
were these really graphic shapes


823
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:31,876
around her eyes.


824
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:33,276
I'm going to try
and pull those out.


825
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,986
Again, like I said, I'm
going pretty darn fast here.


826
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:43,716
So, I apologize I'm being a
bit sloppy in how I do this.


827
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:46,116
Once I've painted kind
of on top of this,


828
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:48,926
it starts to make
it feel more graphic


829
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:51,836
and make it feel a
bit more painterly


830
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,946
and less creature-shop.


831
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:58,556
I'm just trying to get
in some of these folds.


832
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:02,936
I'm going to get some
great crow's feet


833
00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:03,556
on the side of her face.


834
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:06,096
It's funny because, shaders,
we always love to work


835
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:09,396
on old characters because their
faces really tell a story.


836
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:13,176
You can see, you know, the most
common expression a person has


837
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:13,986
had for their whole life.


838
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:17,346
You know, if you frown a
lot, those lines are kind


839
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:19,206
of etched permanently
into your face.


840
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:23,186
And with older characters,
I actually get to take part


841
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:25,886
in telling the story by what
the character looks like.


842
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,816
And that was-- you know, my goal
here is I-- with Hardscrabble,


843
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:33,386
I really wanted her to look
as good as this character was,


844
00:40:33,386 --> 00:40:35,046
I mean, because she's
such an awesome character


845
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:38,596
and I really wanted to take
part in telling that story


846
00:40:38,596 --> 00:40:41,456
and make her look visually
as cool as I possibly could.


847
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,546
So this is good enough for
now, a good starting point.


848
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:47,906
So I've painted into
this bump channel.


849
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:52,056
And I can actually take
that channel and start


850
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:53,466
to use it in the color.


851
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:55,636
So when I visit that
channel here,


852
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:57,786
I can multiply the color
just like in Photoshop.


853
00:40:58,106 --> 00:41:00,276
And we can start to see how
it will affect the final look


854
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:00,836
of the character.


855
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:02,636
But there's a whole
lot of other channels


856
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:05,716
that are needed for
the final look.


857
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,626
The first is the
specular channel.


858
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:10,306
What this is, and I'm not going
to bother painting it today,


859
00:41:10,776 --> 00:41:14,976
what this is, is it's showing
where the shininess is,


860
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,076
if that makes any sense.


861
00:41:16,076 --> 00:41:17,186
It's showing what
parts are going


862
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,866
to be shinier than other parts.


863
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,456
And then the roughness channel,
which makes it even less sense,


864
00:41:21,456 --> 00:41:23,386
is showing how glossy


865
00:41:23,386 --> 00:41:26,206
or how rough those specular
highlights are going to be.


866
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:30,496
Now, as an artist, these
things don't make a whole lot


867
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:31,476
of sense to me visually.


868
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:33,316
I look at this gray
and I'm like, "OK.


869
00:41:33,976 --> 00:41:35,636
What does that mean, right?


870
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:36,496
Her eyes are black.


871
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:39,566
Her lips are a slightly
darker gray than her skin.


872
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:40,856
Her color is this other gray.


873
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,506
I don't know how that
affects the final look."


874
00:41:44,506 --> 00:41:47,076
And before a program like
MARI, I would have to load


875
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:49,516
up these channels as
individual flattened images


876
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:51,016
in a program like Photoshop.


877
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:54,956
I'd paint the gray her of her
lips and hope that it was going


878
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:57,116
to be the right shade of gray.


879
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:58,866
And then I'd kick off a render,


880
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,856
and that render would take
anywhere from two minutes


881
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:05,016
for a really kind of
inexpensive render


882
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:07,306
that shows me a vague idea
of what it's going to look


883
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:11,036
like to a full 12-hour render if
I'm going into the actual shot


884
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:13,166
from the film with all of the
lighting and all the bells


885
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,046
and whistles turned on.


886
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:17,156
So if I really wanted to see
how her lips looked in the shot,


887
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:19,786
I would need to wait up
to 12 hours to see that.


888
00:42:19,786 --> 00:42:21,076
And so, I'd paint my gray.


889
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:22,766
I'd save the image.


890
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:23,856
I'd kick off the renders.


891
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:25,326
And I would wait.


892
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:27,556
And then I get to render
back and I go like, "OK,


893
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:30,146
her lips are too
glossy," so I'd go back.


894
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:32,016
I'd paint a slightly
darker gray.


895
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,816
And then I'd send it and then
I'd realize I'd gone the wrong


896
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:36,886
direction, and now her
lips are even shinier.


897
00:42:37,136 --> 00:42:38,726
And I'd wait another
12 hours, right?


898
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:39,806
So, you can see how


899
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:42,906
that iteration could completely
kill the creative process.


900
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:45,776
What MARI allows us to do
is it allows us to take all


901
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:49,376
of these separate kind
of nonsensical channels


902
00:42:49,786 --> 00:42:53,166
and create a shader that we can
actually preview in real time


903
00:42:53,496 --> 00:42:56,186
that lets us look at
what the final look


904
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:58,656
of the character is going to
be in that finished render.


905
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:02,276
And instead of waiting for
anywhere from 2 minutes


906
00:43:02,306 --> 00:43:06,356
to 12 hours, we can see that
at 60 frames per second.


907
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:09,036
So I'm going to switch
over to her shader


908
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:11,006
and turn on the lighting.


909
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:14,616
And you can see here
how now we've got all


910
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:15,506
of those different channels


911
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,726
that I've painted
working at the same time.


912
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,606
We've got those bumps that I
just painted, those wrinkles.


913
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:22,136
We've got the color.


914
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:25,366
And then the shininess, you
can see how her eyelid is much


915
00:43:25,476 --> 00:43:28,036
shinier than the
rest of her skin.


916
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:30,986
And this is, you know, this
is possible, you know, again,


917
00:43:30,986 --> 00:43:32,926
through the hardware and the
software working together


918
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:33,826
to give us this image.


919
00:43:34,366 --> 00:43:37,736
And if you think about it,
remember how I said that each


920
00:43:37,736 --> 00:43:40,626
of those frames was
8,000 pixel squared.


921
00:43:40,946 --> 00:43:43,516
Well there's nine of those
for every single channel.


922
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:45,916
So for one channel,
the color channel,


923
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:49,366
that's 600 million
pixels, all right,


924
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:52,136
600 million points
of image data.


925
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:56,506
Now we're looking at four
channels simultaneously which is


926
00:43:56,586 --> 00:44:00,106
about 2.4 billion
pixels, all right?


927
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:02,146
That is a vast amount of data.


928
00:44:02,146 --> 00:44:04,756
That's 10 gigabytes
of image data.


929
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:07,996
And MARI is letting us
preview that all in real time


930
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:10,646
and it's running so
smoothly on this hardware.


931
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:14,536
I've been working on MARI for
about two or three years now


932
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:16,156
and I've never seen
it run smoother


933
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,776
than it does on the new Mac Pro.


934
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:20,626
By the way, so I've been
working on this for a couple


935
00:44:20,626 --> 00:44:22,976
of weeks now and it's
been in this giant box.


936
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:26,816
I had no idea what it looked
like until yesterday, all right?


937
00:44:26,886 --> 00:44:27,296
No idea.


938
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:29,606
[ Applause ]


939
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:33,666
The funny thing was it could've
been the size of a mini fridge.


940
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:34,846
I had no idea.


941
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:35,856
Or an iPhone.


942
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:37,676
We were thinking it was this
floating sphere, you know.


943
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:38,596
I had no idea.


944
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:40,986
But I just knew that it
was running really well.


945
00:44:40,986 --> 00:44:43,006
I just had no idea it was
inside this mystery box.


946
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:47,906
So, it was just as exciting for
me yesterday as for you guys.


947
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:49,066
Anyway, I lost my
train of thought.


948
00:44:49,176 --> 00:44:51,646
So here we are.


949
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:52,826
We're looking at
all these shaders.


950
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:55,526
Now, the great thing is even
though it's really pretty


951
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,466
to see this shader in real time,


952
00:44:57,866 --> 00:45:00,516
here's where the actual
real advantage comes in.


953
00:45:01,696 --> 00:45:04,486
Working at an animation studio,
you paint all these details


954
00:45:04,486 --> 00:45:06,156
and then the animators
have to come in


955
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:08,086
and start moving
stuff around, right?


956
00:45:08,086 --> 00:45:09,996
I mean the audacity of that.


957
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:12,676
So, I paint the wrinkles on her


958
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:16,336
and then once the character
actually is talking and moving,


959
00:45:16,336 --> 00:45:19,136
sometimes what I painted
doesn't look right anymore


960
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:20,006
and I have to fix it.


961
00:45:20,006 --> 00:45:22,886
Now, in the past, it's really
hard to identify those problems


962
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,256
or at least it takes
a lot of time


963
00:45:24,256 --> 00:45:27,086
because to render the animation,
I definitely need to wait


964
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:28,636
at least a few hours
to see that.


965
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:31,486
And if I want to see it in
the context of the shot,


966
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:33,506
I would need to wait
up to 12 hours.


967
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:37,906
So, MARI allows us to bring the
final animation from the shot


968
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,516
into this environment so
I can actually preview it.


969
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:42,816
So, I'm going to scrub
to her animation here.


970
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:44,506
And this is the same
shot that I showed you.


971
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,306
And you can see her
speaking and moving around.


972
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:50,946
And I noticed at this point
where she raises eyebrow like,


973
00:45:50,946 --> 00:45:55,296
wow, OK, my textures are
stretching right there,


974
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:55,666
all right?


975
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:56,576
So let me fix that.


976
00:45:56,576 --> 00:45:58,636
So I'm going to go
to my bump channel.


977
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:01,876
I'm going to pull in my
elephant texture again.


978
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:05,836
And I'm going to
grab these wrinkles.


979
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:15,186
And I can paint straight


980
00:46:15,296 --> 00:46:17,926
onto this animated frame,
right, in real time.

982
00:46:19,096 --> 00:46:19,836

984
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,396
And now when I play the
animation, I can say, "OK,


985
00:46:27,516 --> 00:46:29,926
you know, how does it look, you
know, at this moment, right?


986
00:46:29,926 --> 00:46:32,586
How does it look, you
know, at any given frame?"


987

And I've just identified
and fixed a problem


988
00:46:35,496 --> 00:46:37,766
in about 30 seconds that
would've typically taken me


989
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:40,426
about 2 days before if I
were to wait for the full--

all the bells and
whistles renders, right?


991
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:43,676
And that is fantastic.


992
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:47,336
It is-- you know, I'm able
to work ridiculously faster


993
00:46:47,336 --> 00:46:48,666
in an environment like this.

00:46:48,746 --> 00:46:53,176
And it is, you know,
again-- so, like I said,


995
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:55,556
MARI has never run faster than
I've seen it on this machine.


996
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:57,346
And we can push the
limits of that.


997
00:46:57,346 --> 00:47:00,636
So, this character represents
about 10 gigabytes worth


998
00:47:00,636 --> 00:47:02,606
of image data but we
can do more than that.


999
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:07,956
I can bring in Mike Wazowski
which essentially doubles it


1000
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:09,916
to about 20 gigabytes
because he's got his own set


1001
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:10,546
of textures.


1002
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:12,666
And so he's over here, right,


1003
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,566
and we can preview
his animation as well.


1004
00:47:15,206 --> 00:47:20,206
So he's saying, "Please,
let me try the simulator.


1005
00:47:20,616 --> 00:47:21,246
I'll surprise you."

1007
00:47:24,346 --> 00:47:24,926
So there he is.


1008
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:27,236
And we've got both of these
characters and I can see them


1009
00:47:27,236 --> 00:47:29,016
in context together, right?


1010
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:33,226
I can see them right here
and that is so helpful.


1011
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:37,596
It's so amazing to be able to
find and identify any problems


1012
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:39,146
that we have by having
these characters


1013
00:47:39,146 --> 00:47:39,886
in the same room together.


1014
00:47:39,886 --> 00:47:42,726
And I can even bring
in the set and see them


1015
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,746
with their shadows
in this environment.


1016
00:47:45,486 --> 00:47:47,026

1017
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:49,596

that's it for the demo.
