### TileMap ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

The TileMap sample shows how to display a tiled raster map overlay on top of an MKMapView.

The map tile images in this sample were generated by running the gdal2tiles.py utility 
(http://www.gdal.org/gdal2tiles.html) on the nautical chart of the San Francisco Bay obtained
from http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/.

By replacing the Tiles directory structure in the project directory with the output of the
gdal2tiles.py program run on a different source image the sample can be modified to display any
raster map overlay desired.
