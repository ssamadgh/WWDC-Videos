00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,816
>> Hello and welcome.


4
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:34,256
I'm James Vest, and I'm here to


5
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:37,666
teach you today how learning


6
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,386
VoiceOver can help make your app


7
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,666
more usable for everyone.


8
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:45,516
And here's how I'm going to do


9
00:00:45,516 --> 00:00:45,696
that.


10
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,516
I'll tell you what VoiceOver is


11
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,676
and why you should support


12
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,826
VoiceOver and also how to use


13
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,196
VoiceOver if you have never done


14
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:59,636
it before and also how VoiceOver


15
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:03,286
benefits your app.


16
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,626
So what is VoiceOver?


17
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:09,796
I get some common answers like


18
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,006
well VoiceOver is a screen


19
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:12,296
reader.


20
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,906
That's true, but VoiceOver


21
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,716
doesn't just read the screen, or


22
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:20,236
VoiceOver is for the visually


23
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:20,676
impaired.


24
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:24,756
It's true, but it's not just for


25
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:25,566
the visually impaired.


26
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:32,226
So if VoiceOver is not just for


27
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,426
the visually impaired, and it's


28
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,646
not just a screen reader, what


29
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,246
is it?


30
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,926
VoiceOver is an alternative way


31
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,826
of using you app, and it uses


32
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:46,156
gestures, a keyboard, or a


33
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,446
Braille display to give a


34
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:51,196
variety of users equal access to


35
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:54,016
your experience, and it's built


36
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,276
in to every Apple device.


37
00:01:56,786 --> 00:01:59,796
Now think about that last point.


38
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:01,756
It's kind of awesome.


39
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,876
I mean that means that every


40
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,406
person who uses your app has


41
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:09,515
access to VoiceOver.


42
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:15,276
But not every VoiceOver user has


43
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,016
access to every app.


44
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,556
And that's why you're here.


45
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:21,936
That's why you are such an


46
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:24,026
important role in this story


47
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:27,496
because you must update your app


48
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,326
for us to take advantage of


49
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:30,906
VoiceOver.


50
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,516
Now when I say updating your app


51
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,046
or supporting VoiceOver, I'm not


52
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:37,636
talking about creating or


53
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:40,286
maintaining a alternative or


54
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,776
simplified layout or tailored to


55
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,496
a subsection of users.


56
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:50,716
It's about allowing all users to


57
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,276
access the experience that you


58
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:52,756
created.


59
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,486
So why support VoiceOver?


60
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:02,316
Well, supporting VoiceOver makes


61
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,426
your app more inclusive.


62
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,216
VoiceOver users are more likely


63
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:11,226
to choose you app over other


64
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:12,686
apps that don't support


65
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:13,166
VoiceOver.


66
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,716
And this is a great community,


67
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,866
so they are more likely to in


68
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:20,276
turn recommend your app to other


69
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,346
VoiceOver users.


70
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:26,286
But sadly, for many developers,


71
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,606
those reasons are not enough,


72
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,516
and I get it.


73
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:32,196
There's only so much time.


74
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,906
There's only so many resources,


75
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,386
and you want to make the best


76
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:37,756
decisions to create the best


77
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:38,816
experience for the most of your


78
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:39,356
users.


79
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,446
So that's why it's so important


80
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,956
today that you realize that


81
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:47,476
learning VoiceOver can help make


82
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:49,086
your app more usable for


83
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:50,616
everyone, not just VoiceOver


84
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,856
users, for all users.


85
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:55,986
So I bet you're asking yourself,


86
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,196
right?


87
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:57,966
Can a screen reader do that?


88
00:03:58,726 --> 00:03:59,926
Yeah, absolutely.


89
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,756
I mean look at some of the


90
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,366
latest apps coming out, those


91
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:04,416
larger texts.


92
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,386
Those cleaner layouts.


93
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,576
They're not just benefiting low


94
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,596
vision users or users with


95
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:10,396
cognitive needs.


96
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:13,236
They benefit us all, and the


97
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,546
same is true with VoiceOver.


98
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:18,196
So here's how VoiceOver could


99
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:20,086
help you with your app.


100
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:23,516
Well, testing with VoiceOver can


101
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:24,556
give you a new perspective.


102
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:27,016
Now it's easy to take for


103
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,096
granted your app because it's


104
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:29,636
your app.


105
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:31,476
You know exactly what it does,


106
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:32,446
what it's supposed to do, how


107
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,786
it's supposed to do it.


108
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,346
But we take a lot of those


109
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,596
things for granted, and when I


110
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:40,376
say testing with VoiceOver gives


111
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,606
you a new perspective, it's


112
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,636
getting a chance to experience


113
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:45,586
your app in a new way.


114
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:49,356
That's because VoiceOver goes


115
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,606
beyond the way your app location


116
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:52,026
looks.


117
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,656
I mean an app might look good,


118
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,136
but that doesn't make it usable.


119
00:04:56,726 --> 00:05:00,136
So side-scrolling states, hover


120
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:02,366
states, they can all give the


121
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:04,156
allusion of straightforward,


122
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,846
clean, easy-to-use interface.


123
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,606
But testing with VoiceOver goes


124
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,766
beyond that, and so it allows


125
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,726
you to discover new challenges


126
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:18,366
and insights, and finally, I


127
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,656
believe VoiceOver gets really at


128
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:20,646
the heart of what we do.


129
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:24,526
As iOS developers, we pride


130
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:25,566
ourselves on creating


131
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,366
easy-to-use, easy-to-understand


132
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:28,986
apps.


133
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,006
Well those values are especially


134
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,406
apparent when using VoiceOver.


135
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:39,626
So my question to you today is


136
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:41,876
your app so easy to use you


137
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:42,726
could use it with your eyes


138
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:43,246
closed?


139
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:46,886
And that's not a question just


140
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:47,936
for testers.


141
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,906
That's a question for designers,


142
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:50,546
for developers.


143
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:53,816
Anyone responsible for creating


144
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,226
the best experience possible for


145
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:55,866
our users.


146
00:05:56,826 --> 00:05:58,606
And the only way to answer that


147
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,796
question is to start testing


148
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,216
with VoiceOver, and that's what


149
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:04,996
I'm here for today.


150
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,596
I'm going to give you some ways


151
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:08,906
of being able to turn on


152
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:10,096
VoiceOver and start using it.


153
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:11,626
Figure out where you're at,


154
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,376
where you could improve, and


155
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:15,486
then I'll give you some things


156
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:17,706
else to watch out for that might


157
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:20,176
not only improve your VoiceOver


158
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:23,756
experience but possibly the


159
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:25,296
experience that all users get.


160
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:28,476
And here's where we're going to


161
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:29,206
start.


162
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:30,836
We need to know how to use


163
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:31,456
VoiceOver.


164
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:34,296
Now in the next slide, I'm going


165
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:35,136
to show you how to enable


166
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,046
VoiceOver in settings.


167
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,486
What I don't cover in the next


168
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,056
slide is how to navigate with


169
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:41,666
VoiceOver, activate with


170
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,936
VoiceOver, heck even turn


171
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,916
VoiceOver off using VoiceOver.


172
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,696
So if you're following along out


173
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:47,846
there on your iOS device, you


174
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,166
may want to wait.


175
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:53,056
But I promise you, everyone in


176
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:53,886
this room is going to have a


177
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:55,046
chance to turn on VoiceOver


178
00:06:55,046 --> 00:07:00,046
before my presentation is done.


179
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:02,116
So how do we turn on VoiceOver?


180
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,926
Well, it starts in settings, and


181
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:04,596
we go to general.


182
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:07,576
In general, I can open up the


183
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,506
accessibility menu.


184
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:10,396
It's a great list of all the


185
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,136
features that we include on our


186
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:14,296
iOS devices so that we can have


187
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:15,756
equal access to our users.


188
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,726
And VoiceOver is right at the


189
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,476
top of that list, but I


190
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,786
discourage you from opening it


191
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:24,066
there.


192
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,116
I discourage you from going in


193
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:27,916
and enabling VoiceOver because,


194
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:29,906
again, we might not know enough


195
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:31,266
about VoiceOver to turn it back


196
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:31,676
off.


197
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:34,016
So when I teach people how to


198
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,116
use VoiceOver for the first


199
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,916
time, I encourage you to go to


200
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,996
the bottom of this list to the


201
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:41,316
accessibility shortcut.


202
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:45,866
It's here inside of a list of


203
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,406
options.


204
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,206
If I just check VoiceOver, that


205
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,096
means I can easily turn


206
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,866
VoiceOver on when I want to test


207
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,856
it and also turn VoiceOver back


208
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:56,406
off when I'm not ready to test


209
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:58,966
it or my phone goes to sleep or


210
00:07:58,966 --> 00:07:59,656
I get a phone.


211
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,646
So just checking VoiceOver in


212
00:08:02,646 --> 00:08:05,026
this box I can turn it on by


213
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,326
triple clicking the home button.


214
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:07,296
Click, click, click.


215
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,156
And if you have a brand new


216
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,576
device that doesn't have a home


217
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:11,966
button, well then you'd use the


218
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,226
side button, click, click,


219
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:16,376
click.


220
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:18,866
When VoiceOver is enabled, we


221
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,186
see the VoiceOver cursor.


222
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,586
It's a visual reinforcement of


223
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,306
what VoiceOver is trying to


224
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:26,316
describe, and that's the first


225
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:27,406
objective when testing


226
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,366
VoiceOver, is to make sure that


227
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:32,645
these descriptions are accurate


228
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,275
and complete.


229
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:35,556
And the only way you're going to


230
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,596
test every single element inside


231
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:40,515
of your app is to navigate with


232
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,966
VoiceOver, and here's how to do


233
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:44,116
it.


234
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:45,696
Navigating can be as easy as


235
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:46,816
just reaching out and touching


236
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:47,276
the screen.


237
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:49,306
Dragging your finger across the


238
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:50,866
screen, VoiceOver will just read


239
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:52,306
whatever is under your finger.


240
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:57,506
But that's actually not really


241
00:08:57,506 --> 00:09:00,156
how a lot of people review their


242
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:00,506
apps.


243
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:02,766
I start at the top.


244
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,116
I work through everything in


245
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,346
read order to the very end.


246
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,446
VoiceOver users accomplish using


247
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,626
flick navigation, and that's


248
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:11,606
taking my finger and putting it


249
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:13,166
on the screen and then flicking


250
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,536
to the right, flicking to the


251
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:14,766
right.


252
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:16,746
Now if I went slow enough, it


253
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:17,846
would just read under my finger,


254
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,506
so you have to really give it a


255
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:21,306
quick flick until your finger


256
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:22,306
flies off the screen.


257
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:24,316
And conversely, I could go back


258
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:26,346
to the left, and I could go to


259
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:27,766
the previous item or the next


260
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:28,166
item.


261
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:31,886
And it's important that you also


262
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:33,236
want to keep in mind the


263
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,766
starting position of your


264
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:37,066
VoiceOver cursor, because if


265
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:37,906
will start in the middle of your


266
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:38,456
page.


267
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,456
Well, that would assume as a


268
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,326
user that there isn't anything


269
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,366
before it, and so you might be


270
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:47,786
leaving your users without all


271
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:48,876
the story.


272
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:53,236
So, we have two ways to


273
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:56,196
navigate, and we have no way to


274
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,756
control how a user navigates.


275
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:00,016
So you want to test both these


276
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,836
ways to make sure they work as


277
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,506
expected in your app.


278
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:06,656
Now while you're navigating your


279
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:08,416
app, you may need to pause that


280
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:08,806
output.


281
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,086
So, if you ever need to have so


282
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:13,436
stop speaking, just take two


283
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:14,546
fingers and tap the screen.


284
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:17,626
And if you make that peace sign


285
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:18,716
again and tap the screen,


286
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:19,666
VoiceOver will just pick up


287
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,776
right where you left off.


288
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:25,876
Now, if you accidentally enabled


289
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,386
VoiceOver earlier in settings


290
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,866
when I said not to, don't worry.


291
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:30,556
You're halfway to turning it


292
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:31,236
back off.


293
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:32,966
But there's one piece that's


294
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,046
still missing, and that's


295
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:35,556
activating.


296
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:37,176
You know, we take for granted


297
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:38,536
that if I see a button on the


298
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:39,856
screen I just tap it and it


299
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:42,736
opens, but with VoiceOver when I


300
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:45,226
tap an element, it describes it


301
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:46,946
to me, and it gives me the


302
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:47,896
choice to decide.


303
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:49,766
Do I want to open this element


304
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,656
or do I want to move to another?


305
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,376
So, when I reach out and I hear


306
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,746
a description of what I want to


307
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:59,056
open, then I follow that up with


308
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:00,336
a single finger, double tap,


309
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:00,986
tap, tap.


310
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:04,026
And the selected item will open.


311
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:10,306
So to illustrate how navigating


312
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:11,816
and activating with VoiceOver,


313
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:13,736
well, I'd like to welcome to my

Thanks James.


318
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:26,146
So you guys have all heard about


319
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:28,246
how VoiceOver is used, but in

336
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:52,796
I'd like to show you is that


337
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,216
we've got a VoiceOver cursor on

00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:55,296

339
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:56,806
It's a black cursor.


340
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:58,576
That's going to follow me


341
00:11:58,576 --> 00:12:00,176
everywhere I go while I'm using


342
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,276
VoiceOver, and there's really


343
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,366
several different ways that we


344
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:04,606
can move the VoiceOver cursor


345
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:04,876
around.


346
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:06,046

00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:07,096
out and touch just about


348
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:08,566
anything on the screen, and the


349
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,876
VoiceOver cursor is going to


350
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,376
follow along, and it's also


351
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,426
going to speak that item.


352
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:13,346

353
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:13,606

I can also just drag my finger


358
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:21,816
around the screen to move that


359
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,016

360
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:25,756
to follow along, so I'll try

00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:26,186

00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:52,866
>> Or I can find it this way,


383
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,246
and I can double tap.


384
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,276
>> Cupertino.


385
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:57,366
Cupertino.


386
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,596
No weather info-- San Jose,


387
00:12:59,596 --> 00:12:59,956
[inaudible].


388
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:00,706
>> There we go, that's the right


389
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:00,966
location.


390
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:01,956
>> Seventy-three degrees.


391
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,256
>> Except I don't want to hear


392
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:05,126
the entire thing, so I paused it


393
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,296
with a two-finger tap, again,


394
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:07,786
using that peace sign, just


395
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,026
performed that two-finger tap,


396
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:09,906
and it paused the speech.


397
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:10,626
If I do it again.


398
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:12,776
>> Thursday, clear.


399
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,056
High 76.


400
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:14,486
>> This feature zooms.


401
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:15,456
>> Low 52.


402
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:16,566
>> And, again, I can pause it.


403
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:18,336
That way I can send it back to


404
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:18,636
James.


405
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:19,166
Thanks James.


406
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:25,706
[ Applause ]


407
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:26,766
Thanks Ryan.


408
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:31,576
Now I just want to stop here and


409
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:34,136
point out that using these steps


410
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:36,286
alone you can actually start


411
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,576
testing your app with VoiceOver.


412
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:39,136
You can turn it on.


413
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:41,216
You can navigate your app, and


414
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,696
you can see how well it works


415
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,236
but just with VoiceOver on.


416
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:48,686
So now the other side of testing


417
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:50,616
VoiceOver is about getting


418
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:51,896
familiar with the expected


419
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,746
result, and that means getting


420
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,716
outside your app and starting to


421
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:58,046
experience areas that already


422
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,266
have a good VoiceOver


423
00:13:59,266 --> 00:13:59,966
experience.


424
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:02,976
So here's how we do that.


425
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,386
Now if I needed to go home,


426
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:06,826
well, I could press the home


427
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:07,136
button.


428
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:09,536
But on a new device, like iPhone


429
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,596
X, we need to go home by taking


430
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:14,006
our finger from the very bottom


431
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,856
edge of your device and starting


432
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:16,516
to slide it up.


433
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:19,836
The first vibration I feel will


434
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:22,236
go home, and if I keep dragging


435
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,076
up, the second vibration I feel


436
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,506
will open the app switcher.


437
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,596
I can also repeat this gesture


438
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:29,016
from the very top edge of my


439
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:31,426
display and open things like the


440
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,536
Navigation Center and the


441
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:34,236
Control Center.


442
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:39,116
And when you're not testing your


443
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,786
app, you can three-finger flick.


444
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:43,176
It's basically the same as a


445
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:45,226
one-finger flick to allow me to


446
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:48,276
scroll or move between my home


447
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:48,696
screens.


448
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:50,776
But in this case, I'm using


449
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:51,486
three fingers.


450
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,356
So using three fingers back and


451
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:55,736
forth, up and down, will allow


452
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:57,046
me to get to those areas.


453
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:58,306
So whether or not you're


454
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:00,306
exploring other apps or going


455
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:01,506
into Control Center or


456
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:03,126
Notification Center, these areas


457
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:06,076
are full of complex UI that's


458
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:07,626
waiting to teach you the


459
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:09,716
expected results when we focus


460
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:14,266
the VoiceOver cursor on them.


461
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,746
Now another gesture you may need


462
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,316
is called the two-finger scrub,


463
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:20,066
and that's where I take that


464
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,586
same two-finger tap from before,


465
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:24,756
but instead of letting go, I


466
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:25,806
scrub back and forth very


467
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,486
quickly, almost like in a fast Z


468
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,606
pattern, and that will allow me


469
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:32,296
to get out of a window without


470
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:33,806
having to navigate back to


471
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,826
cancel buttons or back buttons.


472
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:37,956
Or in the case of UI, where they


473
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:39,446
don't even have close buttons,


474
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,856
to quickly scrub back and forth


475
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:43,356
and dismiss the window.


476
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:47,436
So while we're busy navigating


477
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:49,266
and exploring and learning about


478
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:52,486
this great expected behavior, we


479
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:53,456
also kind of need to know what


480
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:54,236
we're listening for.


481
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:58,166
So when you open a newspaper,


482
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,196
you receive a lot more visual


483
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:02,236
information than just words on a


484
00:16:02,236 --> 00:16:02,776
page.


485
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,066
Here's that same newspaper.


486
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:10,776
If we fail to infer all of that


487
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:12,496
additional information, like


488
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:16,566
headings or images, so we need


489
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,366
to explore and listen to


490
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:20,546
headings and images, tabs and


491
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,886
buttons, and make sure we're


492
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,266
honoring that experience.


493
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:28,756
Now to demonstrate these initial


494
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:30,776
gestures, here's Ryan Dour.


495
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:32,756
Cool. Thanks James.


496
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:35,016
So we're still here in our


497
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:36,746
weather app, and I would


498
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,936
actually like to go back to the


499
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:39,366
home screen.


500
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,936
This is an iPhone X, so in order


501
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,396
to do that, I need to use our


502
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,396
new home gesture, and that is


503
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:45,876
going to be again, touching my


504
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:47,606
finger at the bottom in the home


505
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:48,926
[inaudible], and then sliding my


506
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,356
finger up until I feel that


507
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,786
first vibration to go home.


508
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,976
VoiceOver will also tell me, if


509
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:55,046
I haven't let go of the screen


510
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,936
yet, that this is exactly what


511
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:58,476
I'm going to do if I let go.


512
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,456
Let's go ahead and check that


513
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:01,096
out.


514
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,046
>> Lift for home.


515
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:04,406
>> And I'm going to do that.


516
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:05,486
>> Weather.


517
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,296
>> Okay, so we're back on the


518
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:07,796
home screen.


519
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:10,435
Many of us have many pages of


520
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:11,925
apps, so in order to switch


521
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,455
between those with VoiceOver, we


522
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,146
use a three-finger swipe.


523
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,205
Actually it's a three-finger


524
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:18,276
flick, but, yeah, it's funny, we


525
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:20,336
actually interchange that a lot


526
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:20,986
here at Apple.


527
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,675
We say three-finger swipe or


528
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:24,736
three-finger flick, but they're


529
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:25,326
interchangeable.


530
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:26,226
I'm going to go ahead and


531
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,956
three-finger swipe left.


532
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:29,666
>> Page three of three.


533
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,086
>> There we go.


534
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:31,506
>> Utilities folder.


535
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:32,496
Four apps.


536
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:33,506
>> I'm going to go ahead and


537
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,946
double tap on this utilities


538
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:38,356
folder so that we can explore


539
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:38,916
the inside.


540
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,476
>> Utilities, heading.


541
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:41,866
>> Let's explore.


542
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:42,926
I'm going to go ahead and flick


543
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:43,596
right.


544
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,566
>> Voice memo, compass, measure,


545
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,416
calculate, calculator.


546
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:48,676
Hear that bonk?


547
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:49,576
I've reached the end.


548
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:50,886
If I flick left--


549
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:52,336
>> Measure, compass, voice,


550
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,636
utilities, heading.


551
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:56,826
>> Well, there's a lot of apps


552
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,976
and a great heading here.


553
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:00,026
However, there's no apparent way


554
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:01,106
to close this folder.


555
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:03,306
Without voiceover on, you would


556
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,936
just tap outside of the folder's


557
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,636
area in order to be able to


558
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,636
close it, but with VoiceOver, we


559
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:09,716
use the two-finger scrub.


560
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,126
Now, you can use it just as


561
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:13,766
James described it, like a Z


562
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,366
gesture, but I'm a DJ, and I


563
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,456
kind of think of it more like a


564
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:17,606
scrub, like you're scratching a


565
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:17,966
record.


566
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:19,346
So let's go ahead and take those


567
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:21,406
two fingers and--


568
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:22,986
>> Utilities folder.


569
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:24,296
>> Boom that folder's closed.


570
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:25,226
>> Four apps.


571
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:27,406
>> Cool. Thanks, James.


572
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:33,836
[ Applause ]


573
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,846
>> Thanks, Ryan.


574
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:37,806
So when faced with a lot of


575
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:40,726
information, a sided user may


576
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,926
choose not to go through every


577
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:45,306
single object in read order to


578
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:46,026
the very end.


579
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,486
No, instead we choose to pay


580
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:49,816
attention to maybe a select


581
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:51,076
group of elements, like these


582
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:52,246
headings on this newspaper.


583
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,456
VoiceOver's users can also


584
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:58,186
navigate this way using the


585
00:18:58,186 --> 00:18:58,686
Rotor.


586
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:02,616
And the Rotor is a VoiceOver


587
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:04,426
feature that dynamically


588
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:06,356
presents options that the user


589
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,836
can adjust or navigate by.


590
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:14,156
A VoiceOver user can set the


591
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:17,096
Rotor by making two fingers on


592
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:19,226
the screen and turning it around


593
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,616
a center point, almost like


594
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:22,206
you're turning an invisible knob


595
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:22,996
on screen.


596
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,896
And as we adjust the rotor,


597
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,806
it'll speak all the options that


598
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:29,376
are supported within the view


599
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,266
that we're focused in.


600
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:33,566
So in this case, we could turn


601
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,176
that rotor and switch it to


602
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,686
headings, and once it's set to


603
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:39,856
headings, I'd be able to go to


604
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:41,286
the next heading by taking a


605
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:43,056
single finger and flicking down.


606
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:45,706
Or, conversely, I could flick up


607
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,496
with one finger, and that would


608
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:48,596
go to the previous heading.


609
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:53,146
And here's why the Rotor matters


610
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:54,436
to you as a developer.


611
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:58,166
Because a Rotor only works if we


612
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,906
as developers remember to


613
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,496
include headings in our apps.


614
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,666
So when your app doesn't support


615
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,226
one of these rotor options, well


616
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,616
then we're kind of taking a tool


617
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:09,666
out of that user's toolbox to


618
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,156
have a great experience in their


619
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:11,846
app.


620
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:15,436
So I invite you to go back into


621
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,026
settings, general,


622
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:17,916
accessibility.


623
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:19,766
Inside of the VoiceOver menu is


624
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:20,886
a lot of great settings that


625
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,706
VoiceOver users customize, and


626
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,476
one of them is the Rotor


627
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:25,066
settings.


628
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:27,506
So review what we can support


629
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:29,286
and make sure that we are


630
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:32,276
honoring those in our apps.


631
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:33,736
So here's Ryan Dour to


632
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:35,336
demonstrate how the Rotor works.


633
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:36,876
>> Cook, thanks James.


634
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,746
So again we're back here on the


635
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:40,636
home screen.


636
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:42,016
We're on our second page of


637
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:44,126
apps, and I'm going to open the


638
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:44,606
App Store.


639
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:45,556
So I'm going to flick once,


640
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:45,816
right.


641
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:46,806
>> App Store.


642
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:47,506
>> There it is.


643
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,076
Image going to double tap again


644
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,246
to activate.


645
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:51,466
>> Apps, heading.


646
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,876
>> So I'm on the apps tab of the


647
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:54,426
App Store.


648
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,886
There are an awful lot of


649
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,306
fantastic apps here.


650
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,386
However, I don't want to have to


651
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:00,736
explore each and every one of


652
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:01,796
them to get to the various


653
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:02,516
categories.


654
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:05,136
So I can actually touch one of


655
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:05,586
them.


656
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:08,856
>> WWDC18, celebrating the Apple


657
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:10,026
design award winners.


658
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,896
>> And I'm pausing this speech


659
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,026
again with that two-finger tap.


660
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,226
Now, to do the Rotor gesture,


661
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,336
all I have to do is take two


662
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,966
fingers and turn either


663
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:21,486
clockwise or counterclockwise.


664
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:25,136
>> Characters, words, headings.


665
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:26,376
>> There's the one I want.


666
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,786
As soon as I let go, I am on


667
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,306
that rotor.


668
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,846
Now, if I flick down--


669
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:32,126
>> New apps we love, best new


670
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,576
updates, stream yourself selfie


671
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:36,506
with light skin tone, heading.


672
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:38,876
>> Now, if I flick up--


673
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:41,436
>> Best new updates, new apps we


674
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:42,546
love, heading.


675
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:44,776
>> I move back up that list, and


676
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:46,506
of course if I want, I can go


677
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:49,076
ahead and dive into a category,


678
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:51,926
but before I do, I want to tell


679
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:53,216
you guys about one more gesture,


680
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,006
one that is, at least for me,


681
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:56,106
extremely important.


682
00:21:56,586 --> 00:21:58,186
So James started this whole


683
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:00,216
thing off with asking you a very


684
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:01,946
important question, which is, is


685
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,116
your app easy enough to use with


686
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:04,996
your eyes closed?


687
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:07,676
And I'm going to guess that for


688
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:08,726
a lot of you, you might say,


689
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,176
geez, I have no idea.


690
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:14,356
I'm going to find out, but for


691
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:16,476
me that is my experience.


692
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,896
I don't get to see your app.


693
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:19,206
I cants see your app.


694
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:21,176
So for me I really need that


695
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:22,656
question to actually be the most


696
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,026
serious one you ask yourself.


697
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:27,346
Now, keeping your eyes closed is


698
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,036
a challenge.


699
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:29,446
It's very difficult to keep it


700
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:31,046
up, and also you might want to


701
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:31,906
be looking at your computer,


702
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,986
taking notes, and doing other


703
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:33,266
things.


704
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:35,746
So in order to do this, the most


705
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:37,636
effective way I know possible, I


706
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:39,336
encourage you to use the screen


707
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:39,726
curtain.


708
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:42,036
The screen curtain blacks out


709
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,656
your entire screen and puts you


710
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,506
in my shoes.


711
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:47,726
You have a chance to use your


712
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:49,756
app the way I use it entirely,


713
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:51,476
and there's no cheating here.


714
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,266
That is the only interface


715
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:54,066
you're going to get.


716
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:55,176
Let's turn it on.


717
00:22:55,616 --> 00:22:57,436
So three-finger triple tap.


718
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,466
Again, three fingers, three


719
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,096
times.


720
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,196
>> Screen curtain on.


721
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:03,086
>> There we go.


722
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,066
At this point, we're on the same


723
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:09,476
plane, and if I, again, flick


724
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:09,846
down--


725
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:12,236
>> Best new updates, heading.


726
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:13,306
>> And I flick right, let's


727
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:14,106
start exploring.


728
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,966
>> See all, button.


729
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,266
>> Of course now I know that's a


730
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,816
button, and I can activate that


731
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:19,076
button.


732
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:21,096
So I'm going to go ahead and do


733
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:21,836
a double tap.


734
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,026
>> See apps, back button.


735
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:23,956
>> I'm in the apps areas, I'm


736
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:25,016
going to start flicking through


737
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:26,306
to the right, let's explore.


738
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:27,026
>> Best new update, [inaudible]


739
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,786
get, but, world of dinosaurs,


740
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:34,086
$1.99, in-app purchases, button.


741
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:35,676
>> That's a lot of information


742
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:36,636
that you're getting that's


743
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:37,696
usually very visual.


744
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,056
>> Procreate pocket,


745
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:41,046
entertainment, button.


746
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:42,296
>> And of course, if I want to


747
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,686
go back, that two-finger scrub--


748
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:45,906
>> Apps, heading.


749
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:48,656
>> And we're back.


750
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:49,936
>> Screen curtain off.


751
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,526
>> So that is screen curtain,


752
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,206
and I can't encourage you enough


753
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:54,786
to use it because when you make


754
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:56,386
your app experience something


755
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:57,576
that you can take VoiceOver


756
00:23:57,576 --> 00:24:00,316
through, both enjoy and make


757
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,076
sure that it's completely


758
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:03,906
amazing, then so can I.


759
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,826
I can enjoy your app in full if


760
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:08,226
you take this through as the


761
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:09,856
final step before you call it


762
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:10,136
done.


763
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:10,896
Thank you.


764
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:17,616
[ Applause ]


765
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:18,646
>> Thanks Ryan.


766
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,616
So now it's time to talk about


767
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:23,026
how VoiceOver can benefit your


768
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:23,236
app.


769
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:25,766
Because you're ready.


770
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:29,786
Today you can leave this area


771
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:32,636
and go and test your app, and I


772
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:34,216
would encourage you to test it


773
00:24:34,216 --> 00:24:35,326
like you normally would just


774
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:36,236
with VoiceOver on.


775
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:38,356
But I want you to pay attention


776
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:39,796
to these additional insights


777
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:42,366
that could make your app better


778
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:43,856
for all users.


779
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,336
So one, if something doesn't


780
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,346
sound right, it may not read


781
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:51,046
right either.


782
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:54,696
It's like when a writer reads


783
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:56,306
something aloud that they wrote.


784
00:24:57,356 --> 00:24:58,406
It's just another way to check


785
00:24:58,406 --> 00:24:59,476
that your message is coming


786
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,266
through, and it doesn't just


787
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,806
look right, it actually sounds


788
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:03,536
right as well.


789
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,646
Two, if navigating with


790
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:11,096
VoiceOver takes effort, it


791
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:12,456
probably takes a lot of effort


792
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:14,646
visually as well.


793
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,136
So maybe it's time to add


794
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:17,676
section headings or break up


795
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:20,296
your content to allow users of


796
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:21,276
your app to benefit from a


797
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:22,876
cleaner, more straightforward


798
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:25,466
visual and spoken experience.


799
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:32,466
Three, if your app sounds out of


800
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:37,296
order, your content may be too.


801
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,566
VoiceOver navigates your app in


802
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:40,186
read order.


803
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:42,106
So if you're navigating your app


804
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,906
wondering where's the login?


805
00:25:44,286 --> 00:25:45,956
Well, likely is a lot of your


806
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:47,376
audience asking the same


807
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:47,986
question.


808
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:51,486
There it is.


809
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,476
So these issues can't hide from


810
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:56,746
VoiceOver and neither should


811
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:57,046
you.


812
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,546
So let's turn it on.


813
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:01,226
Are you guys ready?


814
00:26:01,746 --> 00:26:02,716
Come on, do you remember how?


815
00:26:02,716 --> 00:26:05,036
All right, let's review then,


816
00:26:05,036 --> 00:26:05,366
all right.


817
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,586
So inside of settings, we're


818
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:08,326
going to go to general.


819
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:10,146
If you have an iOS device, feel


820
00:26:10,146 --> 00:26:12,776
free to take it out.


821
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:14,376
Inside of general is


822
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:15,306
accessibility.


823
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:21,416
Accessibility, we're going to


824
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:22,896
ignore the very top of the


825
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:25,186
screen, and we're going to go


826
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:26,236
all the way to the bottom.


827
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:28,876
If we can enable today the


828
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:31,236
accessibility shortcut, not only


829
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,086
are we going to have a chance to


830
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:33,386
turn on VoiceOver, potentially


831
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,646
for the very first time, but


832
00:26:35,256 --> 00:26:36,696
it's also a quick way to go back


833
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,566
and turn it on again, back to


834
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:39,626
show your colleagues.


835
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:41,426
Turn it on again when you go


836
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,766
back to your office or maybe


837
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:44,456
when you're trying to make a


838
00:26:44,456 --> 00:26:46,926
case for trying to give more


839
00:26:46,926 --> 00:26:49,036
resource time to focus on


840
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:49,626
VoiceOver.


841
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:54,086
So, if we've gone into settings,


842
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,946
general, accessibility, and gone


843
00:26:56,996 --> 00:26:59,356
into the accessibility shortcut


844
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,706
and checked VoiceOver, now we'll


845
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:02,966
be able to turn on VoiceOver


846
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,546
quickly with the home button.


847
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:05,486
Click, click, click.


848
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:07,496
Three clicks of the home button


849
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:10,246
or on iPhone X, three clicks of


850
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,496
the side button, click, click,


851
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:11,726
click.


852
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,166
Ready to activate VoiceOver.


853
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:14,976
Let's do that now.


854
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,576
Yeah. And how does it feel,


855
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:28,796
right?


856
00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:31,806
For a lot of us, it's brand new,


857
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:33,466
and so we could have mixed


858
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:35,306
feelings or uncertain feelings.


859
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,716
This could be challenging, but


860
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:39,606
I've never done anything


861
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:40,596
worthwhile in my life that


862
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:41,476
wasn't challenging.


863
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:43,896
All right.


864
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,136
So our next challenge will be


865
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,486
turn VoiceOver back off.


866
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:49,336
[laughter] Let's see if we can


867
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:49,936
do that now.


868
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:52,656
So with the home button, give it


869
00:27:52,656 --> 00:27:54,646
a triple click, click, click,


870
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:55,406
click.


871
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,766
Or with the side button on an


872
00:27:57,836 --> 00:27:58,966
iPhone X, click, click, click.


873
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,906
So, yes, I'm going to call you


874
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:10,526
out individually now, and, but


875
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:11,576
no, in review.


876
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,036
VoiceOver is an alternative way


877
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:14,916
of using your app.


878
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,026
And you can navigate and


879
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:19,846
activate elements based on just


880
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:20,666
how they're labeled.


881
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:25,456
And you can explore other apps


882
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:27,076
to learn expected behavior.


883
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:31,396
And then rediscover your app by


884
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:33,286
hearing it to help identify


885
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:34,766
other issues.


886
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:38,786
So here's some steps I want you


887
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,186
to do as soon as you leave


888
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:42,386
today.


889
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:44,196
Just like Ryan suggested, I want


890
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:45,816
you to close your eyes and test


891
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:46,136
your app.


892
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,586
So really experience this.


893
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:51,626
Start identify issues that


894
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,346
prevent users from getting the


895
00:28:53,346 --> 00:28:55,026
most out of your app.


896
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:58,456
And then open your eyes and


897
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:00,716
confirm that experience, because


898
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:02,716
if you've ever wondered what a


899
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:04,406
VoiceOver experience should be,


900
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:07,586
just remember, the goal is just


901
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:09,396
to match the experience everyone


902
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:09,876
else gets.


903
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:13,346
So compare the two and improve


904
00:29:13,346 --> 00:29:15,446
both based on what you learn.


905
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:20,526
And then make VoiceOver a part


906
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:21,746
of your regular testing.


907
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:23,636
Talk to your team.


908
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:26,186
Make VoiceOver a part of your


909
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:27,866
practice, not just so that you


910
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,156
can continue to improve your


911
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:32,026
experience with every release,


912
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:34,646
but also to avoid losing the


913
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:37,196
lessons that we gained here


914
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:38,666
today.


915
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:40,956
And lastly, go out there and


916
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:43,096
teach others what you know


917
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:45,246
because that's why I'm here


918
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:47,546
today, because teaching is the


919
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:49,416
best way I know how to master


920
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,176
any subject.


921
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:55,176
Now helping you become a master,


922
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:56,716
I also want to share these


923
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:57,546
resources.


924
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,716
Apple.com/accessibility is a


925
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,116
great resource to get to know


926
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:03,836
VoiceOver and other


927
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,116
accessibility features and also


928
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,726
have access to resources such as


929
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:09,226
the guides, not only to


930
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:10,556
reinforce what we learned today


931
00:30:10,556 --> 00:30:11,476
but build on it.


932
00:30:12,116 --> 00:30:13,466
And the same is true for


933
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:15,316
developer.apple.com/


934
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:18,966
accessibility/ios.


935
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:22,836
And for more information, feel


936
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,026
free to rewatch this video.


937
00:30:24,676 --> 00:30:25,946
Anytime we do something for the


938
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:28,026
first time, it's hard to master,


939
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:29,766
so watch it again.


940
00:30:30,356 --> 00:30:32,936
Practice with me until it feels


941
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:34,486
comfortable and you're ready to


942
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:34,856
share.


943
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:36,746
And also, take advantage of


944
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:38,046
these other opportunities.


945
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,696
For instance, tomorrow starting


946
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,446
at 7:00 in the morning until


947
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:44,276
