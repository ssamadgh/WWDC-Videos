00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:19,326
>> Welcome, my name is Eryk


2
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,236
Vershen, I'm am AVFoundation


3
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:22,166
engineer at Apple.


4
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:25,006
This is session 515 which is


5
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,286
about HLS authoring and the HLS


6
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:27,686
tools.


7
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:31,686
HLS is an abbreviation for HTTP


8
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:32,466
Live Streaming.


9
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,696
HLS is the way you stream


10
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:36,916
content to all Apple devices.


11
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,936
I'm going to be talking about


12
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,456
the document HLS Authoring


13
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:42,596
Specification for Apple Devices


14
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:44,366
and the tools we distribute for


15
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:45,996
creating and validating HLS


16
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:46,526
content.


17
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:50,356
The Authoring Specification and


18
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:52,316
other important documents about


19
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:53,906
HLS can be found at this URL


20
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,776
developer.apple.com/streaming.


21
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:59,326
The Authoring Specification is


22
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,336
Apple's advice for authoring HLS


23
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:01,866
content.


24
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,756
We wanted the HLS specification,


25
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,126
the Internet draft, to include


26
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:07,676
only absolutely necessary


27
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:08,486
requirements.


28
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,626
The Authoring Specification, on


29
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:11,756
the other hand, includes


30
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:12,996
requirements that are specific


31
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:15,016
to Apple's players, as well as


32
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:16,066
things that, while not


33
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,906
absolutely required, are part of


34
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:18,726
best practice.


35
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:23,016
The big news this year is we've


36
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,726
added support for HEVC.


37
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,406
Here are the limits on what is


38
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:27,896
playable.


39
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:31,776
Main 10 Profile, Level 5.0, High


40
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:32,116
Tier.


41
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,036
Now that we support HEVC content


42
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:37,746
we've added bit rate guidelines


43
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:38,516
for that as well.


44
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:40,136
You should treat those


45
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:41,326
recommendations as very


46
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:41,966
preliminary.


47
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:44,336
HEVC encoders are still


48
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:46,196
evolving, we expect to see


49
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,856
improvements over time so we may


50
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,116
revise our guidelines in the


51
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:49,606
future.


52
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:52,076
You should also remember that


53
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,446
the bit rate recommendations in


54
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,526
the Authoring Specification are


55
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:56,226
guidelines, they are not cast in


56
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:56,636
stone.


57
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:59,106
We are aware that all content is


58
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:00,816
different, a bit rate that works


59
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:01,806
for a video of two people


60
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,726
talking is not likely to work


61
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:04,656
for a sporting event.


62
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,366
And you may have different


63
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,446
constraints on the number of bit


64
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,346
rate variants that you can


65
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:08,806
provide.


66
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,686
So, use the bit rate guidelines


67
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:11,606
as a starting point.


68
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,486
Having HEVC means that you can


69
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:17,356
have both H.264 and HEVC content


70
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:18,676
in the same master playlist.


71
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,516
So, we've come up with some best


72
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,196
practices.


73
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,696
First and most important, always


74
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,086
use the CODECS attribute.


75
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,006
You need this so that older


76
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,356
players don't try to play the


77
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,376
HEVC content.


78
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,226
Second and almost as important,


79
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:36,096
always include some H.264


80
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:36,556
content.


81
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,516
You need this so older players


82
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,376
will have something that they


83
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:39,796
can play.


84
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:43,576
Now the player will switch


85
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:46,496
between H.264 and HEVC.


86
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:48,136
However, for two variants with


87
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,486
similar bit rates the player


88
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:50,926
will typically favor the HEVC


89
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:51,446
content.


90
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:54,526
While H.264 content could be in


91
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,656
FMP4 files for maximum


92
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,906
compatibility keep your H.264 in


93
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:00,916
transport streams.


94
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,816
The last point I want to make is


95
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,606
that these same rules apply to


96
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:05,906
so-called trick play content,


97
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,736
that is I-frame-only content.


98
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,826
Along with adding HEVC support


99
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,426
we also added support for a


100
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,796
second subtitle format, IMSC.


101
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,326
If you want more detail on our


102
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:19,066
support for IMSC1 you should


103
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,766
look at this year's Advances in


104
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,286
HTTP Live Streaming talk.


105
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:25,586
IMSC1 is based on TTML, the


106
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,616
timed text markup language and


107
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,026
it's compatible with standards


108
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:32,096
from the EBU and SMPTE.


109
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:35,596
Let's talk about best practices


110
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:37,086
for subtitle content.


111
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,666
We support the text profile of


112
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,186
IMSC and note that IMSC content


113
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:44,356
must be in fragmented MP4 files,


114
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,046
you can't use plaintext files.


115
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:49,176
WebVTT is the same as it has


116
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:50,996
been, text files typically


117
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,456
having an extension of .VTT or


118
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:54,326
.webVTT.


119
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,516
Remember that you can mix up


120
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:00,556
IMSC and webVTT with H.264 HEVC


121
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,006
content however you want,


122
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,366
they're completely independent.


123
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,336
You should always use the IMSC1


124
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:07,426
CODECS value.


125
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:09,576
Including that value ensures


126
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,036
that older clients will ignore


127
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:11,656
the variant.


128
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,246
However, for maximum backward


129
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,046
compatibilities don't put in the


130
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,875
value for the webVTT content.


131
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,896
I want to change gears and talk


132
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,266
about the HLS tools and the


133
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,266
changes we've made there.


134
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,416
The tools are available on the


135
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,916
developer site and you can find


136
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,666
them through the same URL I


137
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,546
mentioned earlier,


138
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,716
developer.apple.com/streaming.


139
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,666
The tools fall into three rough


140
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,726
categories, tools for segmenting


141
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,746
video and audio, tools for


142
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,176
validating content and making


143
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,526
validation reports and finally,


144
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:43,296
tools for creating subtitles,


145
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:44,446
iv3 metadata and master


146
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:45,026
playlists.


147
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,386
Now the validator does not do


148
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:49,066
low-level bitstream checks, you


149
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:50,236
should be using third-party


150
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:51,536
tools if you think you may have


151
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:53,006
issues with your encoders.


152
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:54,576
Let's look at some of the


153
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,186
specific changes we made in the


154
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:58,216
tools.


155
00:04:58,396 --> 00:05:00,036
Well firstly, we've added the


156
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,056
ability for MediaStreamValidator


157
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,316
to check local files.


158
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,846
You no longer have to put an


159
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,536
HTTP server to validate your


160
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,176
streams.


161
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,356
If you have direct file access


162
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,776
you can check them that way and


163
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,296
you can use relative paths,


164
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:15,256
absolute paths or file URLs.


165
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,476
However, I should note that you


166
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:20,506
can't mix file URLs and HTTP,


167
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,896
that is if the master playlist


168
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:23,666
is a file path then the media


169
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,016
playlist it references can't be


170
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,166
HTTP URLs.


171
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,646
Of course, we added support for


172
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,256
HEVC into the tools.


173
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,856
We've also made a lot of general


174
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,046
improvements to the tools,


175
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:35,776
principally the


176
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,516
MediaStreamValidator and HLS


177
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:37,936
report.


178
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:39,886
We check more things about the


179
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:40,446
stream.


180
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,066
There are too many to list, but


181
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:42,986
for example, we're now


182
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,426
validating the CODEC usage.


183
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:46,646
We have better handling for


184
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,876
errors on the stream during


185
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:48,616
validation.


186
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,286
And we made the ordering of


187
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:51,496
variants renditions in the


188
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:53,486
reports be more consistent.


189
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:57,046
We've added several new options,


190
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:58,326
I want to call out just three of


191
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:58,606
them.


192
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,386
First, the description option on


193
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:02,476
MediaStreamValidator.


194
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:04,816
The URLs for a stream don't


195
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:06,166
necessarily make clear what the


196
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:06,936
content is.


197
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:08,696
This option allows you to add


198
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,226
some text describing the stream.


199
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,126
For example, such and such show,


200
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,636
season two, episode five.


201
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:15,386
The text will appear at the top


202
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,656
of the report near the URL.


203
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:20,786
For HLS report, we've added some


204
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,076
new optional columns.


205
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,376
Rather than continue the way we


206
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,686
had previously with separate


207
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,716
options for each column, instead


208
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:29,216
we've added a columns option


209
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,516
that takes a list of column and


210
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,366
identifiers.


211
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,386
The set of available column


212
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:34,796
identifiers can be found using


213
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,336
the Help option or in the


214
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:36,796
[inaudible] page.


215
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,916
The old id and pl options that


216
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,736
gave you data id values and


217
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:42,896
playlist bit rates are still


218
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,546
supported, but are deprecated in


219
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,156
favor of column identifiers.


220
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:47,986
And the column identifiers for


221
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:49,966
those are just id and pl.


222
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,956
Last year we added hdcp-level


223
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,466
support, but we forgot to tell


224
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,846
you about the hdcp-level option


225
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,036
on MediaFileSegmenter.


226
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:01,536
This allows you to set the


227
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:02,186
hdcp-level.


228
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,066
The hdcp-level is included in


229
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,656
the Plist that gets generated by


230
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,746
MediaFileSegmenter.


231
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,006
And you can pass that Plist to


232
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,546
the variant playlist creator to


233
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,846
get the hdcp-level attribute in


234
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:15,396
the generated master playlist.


235
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:19,356
Here's a quick look of a sample


236
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:19,816
report.


237
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:23,556
Notice the second line, that's


238
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:24,696
from the description option that


239
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:25,226
we passed in


240
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:26,306
MediaStreamValidator.


241
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:28,956
And notice that we've now added


242
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,206
a CODECS column so you can see


243
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:34,766
which variants are H.264 and


244
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,016
HEVC.


245
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,226
Now we use the AVC, the


246
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:40,426
alternate name of H.264 so that


247
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,396
we'll have more visible


248
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:42,886
separation between the two CODEC


249
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:43,356
types.


250
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,096
As part of the changes in the


251
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:48,006
ordering of variants and


252
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:50,506
renditions, we now keep audio,


253
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,126
closed caption and subtitle


254
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:53,176
renditions separate.


255
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:57,836
To summarize, remember that URL,


256
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:00,266
developer.apple.com/streaming,


257
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:02,246
everything you need to know is


258
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:03,506
pointed to from that page.


259
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:05,456
Besides the various documents it


260
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:06,666
also has links to sample


261
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,506
streams, to the tools download,


262
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,246
to past videos about HLS, the


263
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,306
information about FairPlay


264
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,126
Streaming and so on.


265
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,556
I encourage you all to read the


266
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:17,946
HLS Authoring Specification for


267
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:20,306
Apple Devices and the HLS spec.


268
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,496
For more information go to the


269
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:24,746
webpage for this talk,


270
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:30,226
developer.apple.com/WWDC17/515.


271
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:34,596
We have some related video


272
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:37,416
sessions, Advances in HTTP Live


273
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:37,946
Streaming.


274
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,186
This has more discussion of HEVC


275
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,645
and IMSC1, as well as some other


276
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:44,636
interesting topics.


277
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,706
And Error Handling Best


278
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,356
Practices for HTTP Live


279
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:48,806
Streaming.


280
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,466
That will help you understand


281
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,306
what your server needs to do to


282
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:53,776
be a good HLS server.


283
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:55,976
You can watch either of these


284
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,836
videos via the web or in the


285
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,066
WWDC app.


286
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,136
I hope you found the talk


287
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:02,436
useful, thanks for watching.
