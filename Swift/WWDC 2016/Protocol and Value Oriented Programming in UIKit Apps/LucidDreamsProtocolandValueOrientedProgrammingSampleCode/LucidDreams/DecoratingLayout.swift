    Provides the `DecoratingLayout` used throughout the application and

    `DecoratingLayout` shows a decoration layout on the left with its content on
    the right. This is the type that is focused on during the WWDC session. One
    very interesting aspect to this layout is that it's composed of other layouts
    like `InsetLayout`!
