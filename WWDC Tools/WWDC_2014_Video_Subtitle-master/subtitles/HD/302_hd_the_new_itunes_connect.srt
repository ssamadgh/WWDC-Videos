00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,416
Welcome to "The New
iTunes Connect."


4
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:23,476
I'm Dave Van Tassell,


5
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:26,046
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.


6
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:28,036
We have a lot of great things
to talk to you about today.


7
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:30,316
To do so, I'm going
to need the clicker


8
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:31,226
over on this desk right here.


9
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:35,246
It all starts with a new design.


10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,636
We want to take you on a
little bit of a walkthrough,


11
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:39,806
some of the new features
that we've added,


12
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,606
some of the new flows.


13
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,366
Second thing is app previews.


14
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:48,416
It's a great chance for you to
upload a video 15 to 30 seconds,


15
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:51,946
dynamic view of what
makes your app magical.


16
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:57,636
App bundles - you can bundle
up to 10 apps together


17
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:00,856
with an easy set-up
flow in iTunes Connect.


18
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,946
App analytics - we're
very excited about this.


19
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:06,596
This is the best end to end
view of your app with data


20
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,106
that only Apple can provide.

22
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:17,886
And last, TestFlight
beta testing.

[ Applause ]


24
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,096
We're very excited about this.


25
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:26,846
Give you a little
more insight and depth


26
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:29,736
into what we have planned
for TestFlight beta testing.


27
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,396
So we start with the Home page


28
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:34,996
of iTunes Connect,
an all new design.


29
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:39,096
We have the same sections as
today, with great new icons.


30
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,406
If you have any news or
announcements for you,


31
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:45,006
like perhaps you haven't
signed the latest contract


32
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:47,086
that released, that's going
to go right there on the top.


33
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:51,596
But we came here to work
today, so let's jump


34
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:53,916
into My Apps and
see what we have.


35
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:56,016
The first thing you're going


36
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,926
to notice is it's
wall to wall apps.


37
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,946
We're trying to give it
as much space as we can


38
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:04,486
for all these apps, fit
more apps onto the page,


39
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:07,996
at the same time giving each app
a little more space to breathe,


40
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,316
the full name of the app, the
complete iTunes Connect status.


41
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,626
Easier to tell the
difference between waiting


42
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,096
for review and in review.


43
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:20,006
Also we've added a little badge
there to show the difference


44
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,336
between iOS and Mac apps.


45
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,796
If you came to the My Apps page
to check on, perhaps the status


46
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:29,816
of an app, to see if the "Hair
Salon" app has been approved


47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,406
and is ready to go, there at
the top we have an iSearch bar,


48
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:37,716
type in "hair salon," and
all the hair salon apps float


49
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:38,196
to the top.


50
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:40,436
I see it's all green;
green is good.


51
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,606
My app's been approved,
it's ready for sale,


52
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,296
I'm off to go check
and see how it's doing.


53
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:48,536
We've also added some filtering.


54
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:53,106
You can see there in the
top right-hand corner,


55
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,306
the search by status.


56
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,636
You can filter - and see I
have 24 different statuses,


57
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,226
23 are ready for sale.


58
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:00,636
I have one prepared for upload.


59
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,746
If I want to click on
one of these statuses,


60
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:04,236
then I'll filter away
all the other apps


61
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,966
and show just the apps with
this iTunes Connect status.


62
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:10,016
Some of you like the list view;
we've improved that as well.


63
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:15,716
More apps on one page, the
same search and filtering


64
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,236
that we've provided on
the icon view also exists


65
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:18,976
on this list view.


66
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:23,276
You can sort by the different
column names, change that up.


67
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:26,656
And what's great is if you leave
the My Apps page and come back,


68
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:29,076
or if you sign out iTunes
Connect, when you come back


69
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:31,356
to My Apps we'll take you
right back to the list view.


70
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:36,166
We're going to go back into the
icon view and jump into an app.


71
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,156
What we've done here is
combine the app pages


72
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:41,846
and the version pages into one,


73
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:44,016
because at the top
we have the app icon,


74
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:48,216
and going across we have
different tabs, we have pricing,


75
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:51,356
we have In-App Purchases,
manage your Game Center.


76
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:55,926
We take you by default to the
version tab and to the ready


77
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:57,416
for sale version of My App.


78
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:01,276
I can see the screenshots
right there in front of me


79
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,936
and other metadata as it goes.


80
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:05,266
What we want to do is
create a new version.


81
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:08,246
So we click on the upper
right-hand corner there,


82
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,096
it's the new version button,
and we're provided with a window


83
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,046
to enter in our version number.


84
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:17,866
You'll notice there's no "what's
new" text on this window.


85
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,896
This information is still
required, but we understand


86
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:23,656
that you don't always have
all the marketing data ready


87
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,836
when you want to take actions
like create a new version.


88
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,186
And in fact, we've added this
to the new app flow as well.


89
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:32,246
When you create a new app,
all you need is a name,


90
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:34,016
a bundle ID and a SKU.

This is the new iTunes
Connect, right?


93

You can come back when you're
ready to do those descriptions,


94
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:46,236
those screenshots
and what have you.


95
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,976
All right, so we're going
to create this new version.


96
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:54,846
It'll create a new sub-tab
there with the 1.0.2.


97
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:58,796
It's copied over the screenshots


98
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,576
from the previous
version, like normal.


99
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:01,836
We can see that the What's New


100
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,456
in this version text
hasn't been filled in.


101
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:05,406
I can fill it in
now, either way.


102
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,086
I keep scrolling down,
and I see the rest


103
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:10,556
of my version information.


104

now, easy to edit.

create the iPad version


107
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:23,456
of this app, make it universal.


108
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:29,366
So I'm going to click on the
iPad tab, and what I need


109
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,286
for an iPad is new screenshots,


110
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:34,426
that's really the only metadata
difference iPhones and iPads.


111
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:38,956

on in my app, right now.

a more dynamic experience.

preview here as well.

and then upload screenshot
3, and then upload the video,

can drag and drop.

frame, we're off to go.

that I would like to use is

just going to scrub on through,

like, this is great.

00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:49,576
App previews are up to
30 seconds in length,


170
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:54,066
and we accept both H.264
and ProRes content.


171
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:56,056
And that's app previews.


172
00:08:57,516 --> 00:09:02,526
[ Applause ]


173
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,176
Now we move on to App Bundles.


174
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:09,456
App Bundles is a great
feature to bundle together apps


175
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:14,006
of the same kind, giving
your customers and people


176
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:15,496
on the App Store just
one choice instead


177
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:16,756
of many on what to download.


178
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:20,836
The first step if you want to
have an app bundle is, well,


179
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:23,566
what apps do I put in my bundle?


180
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,746
So, you have all the apps


181
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:26,546
in your head whether it's iTunes
Connect, and you're trying


182
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,026
to think about it, you got
to choose some of them.


183
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:28,996
You can have up to 10.


184
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:31,876
In this case I'm going
to pick four of them


185
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:33,206
and create an app bundle.


186
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:34,406
And this is great.


187
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,466
It offers more value for
the people on the App Store.


188
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:41,066
It's a single install to get
all of your great apps at once.


189
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:44,456
And we've included in
this Complete my Bundle.


190
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:47,696
It's the same feature we
give for music and for TV,


191
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,146
where if somebody's already
purchased one or more


192
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:53,906
of the apps in your bundle, then
they'll get a discounted price


193
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,166
to purchase the rest of your
bundle to encourage them


194
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,476
to get all of your apps.


195
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,646
[ Applause ]


196
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:06,576
So that was step one, selecting
what apps go in my bundle.


197
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,456
The next thing we're going
to want is the metadata


198
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:10,606
to show in the iTunes store.


199
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:12,546
We're going to need
a bundle name,


200
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,416
we're going to need
a description.


201
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,006
It's probably going to need
screenshots, app preview,


202
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:20,476
got to select categories,
rating, marketing URLs,


203
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,126
privacy URLs, all
these different pieces.


204
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,866
Because we want to make this
as simple as possible for you,


205
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,516
and we realize that we have a
lot of this information already.


206
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,346
So it starts with information
that is specific to the bundle.


207
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,146
Each bundle will
need its own name;


208
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,296
it'll need a description
about the bundle.


209
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:41,716
Obviously it has its own
price, has its own SKU


210
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:46,436
and a marketing URL so you can
market this bundle on its own.


211
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,526
And then we have
this information


212
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:50,656
that comes from the first app.


213
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:54,996
It was that key app, the
first app for this bundle.


214
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,826
So the first screenshot
will come from that app,


215
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,716
the first app preview
that you see


216
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:02,046
on the App Store will
come from that app.


217
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,996
The categories of
your bundle will match


218
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:09,246
that of the first app, and the
App Store contact information,


219
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,696
App review information,
all of that will be pulled


220
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:15,706
from the first app as well,
as well as the privacy URL.


221
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:22,176
The rest of the information from
your bundle will come from all


222
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:23,086
of the apps in the bundle.


223
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:27,816
If you have three apps that are
4 plus, and one app is 12 plus,


224
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:29,676
your bundle will
be rated 12 plus.


225
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:33,776
If you want your bundle to be
made for kids, all of the apps


226
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:35,886
in the bundle must
be made for kids.


227
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,946
The rest of the screenshots
and app previews will come


228
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,186
from the other apps in your
bundle - and equal share


229
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,396
for every app in your bundle.


230
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:49,096
And for keywords we'll take
all of the keywords from all


231
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,316
of the apps in the
bundle and apply those.


232
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,156
You don't have to
re-enter any new keywords.


233
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:58,416
Let's take a look and see how
we do this in iTunes Connect.


234
00:11:58,536 --> 00:11:59,926
We come back to the
My Apps page.


235
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:03,996
We click New App Bundle.


236
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,856
The first thing we want to enter


237
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:11,006
as our new app bundle
name, "Toca Toy Box."


238
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:12,976
We start selecting the apps.


239
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:20,266
At this point I realize, OK,


240
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,446
this first app is
important, it's key.


241
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:25,486
So, I know which four I
want in my app bundle,


242
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:29,586
but I would like to make
this one that primary app.


243
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,336
Once I've selected my apps,


244
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:36,456
I can now see I have my
screenshots have already been


245
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,336
populated for me
from that first app.


246
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:43,586
I can fill in the app bundle
description, the marketing URL.


247
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,926
Privacy policy URL
has already been done.


248
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,506
Let's scroll down further.


249
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:52,276
I need to select a price tier.


250
00:12:52,276 --> 00:12:56,466
It needs to be a discounted
price tier, less, one tier less


251
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,816
than the sum of all the apps in
the bundle - it is a discount -


252
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,346
as well as give it a SKU.


253
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,226
Then the rest of the information
has already been filled in:


254
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:05,616
categories, the rating.


255
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:07,716
I'm good to go, at
this point I'm done.


256
00:13:07,716 --> 00:13:09,926
I've created my app bundle,
I'm ready to submit it.


257
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,226
One thing to remember
with app bundles is


258
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,176
that once they've been submitted


259
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,866
to the App Store you
can't change the apps


260
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,516
in a bundle; they're immutable.


261
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:22,476
If you want to make a
bundle with now five apps


262
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:23,646
or six apps instead
of this four,


263
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,276
then just create a
new bundle and submit


264
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:25,966
that to the App Store.


265
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:28,936
Here's what it looks
like on the App Store.


266
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,426
You can see your app icon.


267
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,426
You can see all the
apps in the bundle.


268
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:36,676
The app preview and
screenshots come down below.


269
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:41,286
You can have up to 10 paid
apps in an app bundle.


270
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:44,696
You have to give it
that discounted price.


271
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:49,506
The first preview and screenshot
come from that first app.


272
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,266
We're going to link
to all the other apps


273
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,006
in your bundle right
there on the App Store.


274
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:55,066
And with Complete My Bundle,


275
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,026
people who have already
purchased one or more


276
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:59,706
of those apps will
get discounted price


277
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,796
to purchase the rest
of your bundle


278
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:01,896
and get the whole package.


279
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:03,236
And that's App Bundles.


280
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:05,826
With that, I'd like to turn
the time over to Trystan


281
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,086
to talk about App Analytics.


282
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:13,656
[ Applause ]


283
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:14,856
>> Thank you, Dave.


284
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,806
My name is Trystan Kosmynka,


285
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,986
Engineering Manager
working on App Analytics.


286
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:22,146
Really excited today to show
you what we've been up to.


287
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,116
Before we get into it,


288
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:26,316
let's talk about what it
takes to build a great app.


289
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:28,716
We're all here this week
to learn tips and tricks


290
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:29,936
on building a great app.


291
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,866
We know that it all
starts with a great idea.


292
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:35,526
Every app that's
in the store today


293
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,936
that achieves great success
starts with a great idea,


294
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:41,846
and how do you capture that and
present that to your customers?


295
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,826
You do that with
thoughtful design,


296
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:46,576
pixel-perfect design,
intuitive design.


297
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:49,326
You focus on really
complete flows


298
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:50,946
that make sense to
your customers.


299
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:55,126
We write bug-free code, we
all here write bug-free code.


300
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:57,436
Worked on my device.


301
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,356
We test, and we test,
and we test some more.


302
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:04,626
So, we have automated unit
tests, automated UI tests.


303
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:05,356
We're going to talk more


304
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:07,466
about our beta testing
service as well.


305
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,716
This is a really
important part of writing


306
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:11,506
and creating a great app.


307
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:13,836
Finally, we submit to the store.


308
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:17,176
These are all pieces,
developer responsibility


309
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,146
that we're familiar with today,


310
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:21,506
and Apple does a fantastic job
supporting you throughout this


311
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,686
process, with great tools,
with Xcode, more great tools


312
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:26,056
and services we're
talking about today.


313
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:29,646
But we know that our job
is not done as developers.


314
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,056
Once we submit to the store,


315
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,116
there's this whole new
set of responsibilities.


316
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:34,416
We're not all done.


317
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,406
And this is after launch.


318
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:39,426
And this is what App
Analytics is all about.


319
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:43,276
These new responsibilities
can influence this chart.


320
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,836
Hopefully, if you have
apps in the store,


321
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:47,226
this chart is familiar to you.


322
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:50,136
You have your downloads
over time, it's increasing,


323
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:53,546
and you see points of
acceleration over time as well.


324
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:55,796
Let's talk about what it
takes to influence that,


325
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:57,736
and why App Analytics
is really important.


326
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:01,366
So first, our App
Store presence.


327
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,356
We can see on this chart now I
have that orange dot and I see


328
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:10,506
that App Store presence really
can influence my downloads.


329
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:15,806
App Store presence is your name,
your description, your keywords.


330
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:17,386
We have these App Bundles now.


331
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:19,706
We also have our
App Store previews.


332
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,796
These are great ways to get
your app to have more downloads,


333
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:25,556
more customers, more
people using your app.


334
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:26,656
Marketing.


335
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:29,066
Once you have a great app
you want to get the word out.


336
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,776
As developers, we don't
just submit to the store,


337
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,416
we submit it to our
social networks,


338
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,946
we send it to our
friends and our family.


339
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:37,676
We create a home page,
potentially some newsletters.


340
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:39,616
Marketing's a really
important piece.


341
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:41,236
New updates.


342
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,966
When you're building an
application and submit it


343
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:47,046
to the store your
customers crave new content.


344
00:16:47,536 --> 00:16:54,706
New levels, new ways to engage
existing customers and new ways


345
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:55,876
to attract more customers.


346
00:16:56,156 --> 00:17:00,046
Your app needs to stay fresh and
unique, and to do that you go


347
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,306
through this constant
release and build cycle.


348
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,126
Next is advertising.


349
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:08,506
Advertising and marketing
are often used


350
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,976
in the same vocabulary,


351
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:11,566
but advertising's a
little bit different.


352
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:15,406
As a developer you may choose
to pay for advertising,


353
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:16,415
and that's a big decision.


354
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:19,846
You want to know if it was worth
the advertising investment,


355
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,606
if you got a nice
return on that.


356
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:24,846
App Analytics is there to help
you inform those decisions.


357
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:32,156
All of these dots, all these
lines, you want to monitor,


358
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:34,916
measure and see how
they're changing over time,


359
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:37,636
and App Analytics is there
to provide those answers.


360
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:40,136
And that is why we
use App Analytics.


361
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,186
Because App Analytics
provides answers.


362
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:46,986
It helps you answer questions
like, "How's my app doing?


363
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:51,586
Are people returning to my app?"


364
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,606
Are people converting on
your In-App Purchases?


365
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,916
App Analytics helps you make
good advertising decisions.


366
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:02,436
And this is one I'm
really excited about.


367
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:04,736
App Analytics helps you
reveal missed opportunities.


368
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:06,746
With App Analytics you can see


369
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:09,576
that your App Store presence
is great in the United States,


370
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:12,156
and a lot of customers
are looking at your app


371
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,946
in the United States
and actually turning


372
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,976
into real customers as
opposed to potential customers.


373
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,696
The same may not be
the case in Germany.


374
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:24,446
With App Analytics we can see
that the potential customers


375
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,566
in Germany can become
actual customers if we focus


376
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,366
on our German App Store
presence, localization,


377
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:33,236
really understanding the German
culture and understanding


378
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:37,826
that marketing to Germany may be
a completely different animal,


379
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,836
and we can do that with
our App Store presence,


380
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,256
and App Analytics can
point out those areas.


381
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:46,886
Finally, after we launch, it's
all about building a better app,


382
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:49,626
and App Analytics is there
to tell us and point us


383
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:50,776
in the right direction
to do that.


384
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,386
That is why App Analytics
is important.


385
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:59,466
So with that, how do we
look at this at Apple?


386
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,626
How are we looking at App
Analytics as a product


387
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,146
in the service for
app developers?


388
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:06,746
We're focusing on this concept
of the customer lifecycle,


389
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:10,026
and this involves
acquisition to engagement.


390
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:11,826
We want you as developers
to be covered


391
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:13,556
from the point your
app hits the store


392
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:15,416
to the point your
customers are using the app.


393
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:17,656
And let's look at that from
the customer's perspective.


394
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,526
And we start with
our first measure.


395
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,516
Here is your App
Store product page.


396
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:24,586
We have "Trip Guider," an app we
made up for this presentation.


397
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:27,756
The first thing we see
is App Store views.


398
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,876
We're really excited that for
the first time Apple's providing


399
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:33,826
you developers with a view
of your App Store Views.


400
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:34,956
All - thank you.


401
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:39,806
[ Applause ]


402
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,806
This is data only
Apple can provide.


403
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:44,466
It comes straight from the
App Store to you developers.


404
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:48,436
Next we have App
units and sales.


405
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:52,686
This data here gets tracked any
time a potential customer turns


406
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:53,916
into an actual customer


407
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:56,296
and touches your Buy button
inside your product page.


408
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,986
You have this data today
in Sales and Trends


409
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:01,866
if you're familiar with iTunes
Connect, but this is different.


410
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,166
We're tying this data


411
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,086
into a complete picture
with App Store views.


412
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,946
For the first time you can
see your App Store views,


413
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:10,356
and how that drops
for App units.


414
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:16,036
Next, we've combined App
Store data, Billings data,


415
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:17,846
and now we have Device data.


416
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,306
We have Installs.


417
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,916
A customer purchases
your application


418
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,026
but they may install
it on multiple devices,


419
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:28,686
and this is why Installs and App
units are two different metrics.


420
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:33,376
Once your customer installs the
application and starts engaging,


421
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:36,286
we have a new world
with device measures.


422
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:39,236
We have Sessions,
Active devices.


423
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:40,856
We have Retention.


424
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:42,866
We have this concept
of Stickiness as well.


425
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,246
Stickiness is great:
It's a single measure


426
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:48,376
that you can track over time to
insure that you're both growing


427
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,836
and retaining customers.


428
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:52,536
If there's one measure you want
to look at, it's stickiness.


429
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,976
Finally, if your application
has In-App Purchases,


430
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:58,926
we track that as well.


431
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,476
For the first time you can see
the entire customer lifecycle


432
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:05,476
from the point the user
became a real customer


433
00:21:05,986 --> 00:21:07,816
to when they're converting
on Internet purchases.


434
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,786
This concept of average sales,


435
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:13,096
if you're using any
business intelligence today,


436
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,446
you may be looking at
average revenue per user.


437
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,006
This is average sales.


438
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:17,766
We provide that.


439
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:18,956
This in combination


440
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:21,026
with stickiness can tell
you a really powerful story


441
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:24,486
of how your app's doing and how
your customers are performing.


442
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:27,876
So, that's the customer's
view of this.


443
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,476
Let's look at your
view, the developer.


444
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,636
We have our App Store views,
we have our App Units,


445
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:35,406
Active Devices, Retention,
In-App Purchases.


446
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:38,136
This funnel starts to
drop, and that makes sense


447
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,706
because not every
potential customer becomes an


448
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:41,496
actual customer.


449
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:46,586
What does this look like when
we start to ask more questions?


450
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:48,096
How does this look by platform?


451
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:52,466
We start to filter this data
by iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch.


452
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:56,406
We can see the composition of
our App Store views across all


453
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:57,436
of the Apple platforms.


454
00:21:57,826 --> 00:22:02,616
We can also answer that App
Store presence question,


455
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:04,736
"Should I be localizing
for Germany?"


456
00:22:05,096 --> 00:22:07,226
Here, I can see my
apps reviews in Europe.


457
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:10,876
It's quite high, but my app
units in Europe, a little lower,


458
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,786
and this makes sense as well,


459
00:22:12,786 --> 00:22:14,256
and there's an opportunity
there.


460
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:17,596
This is where analytics can help
you reveal missed opportunities.


461
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,166
If we just localize our app,


462
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,746
potentially we can
get more app units


463
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:25,426
and that will help us get more
active devices, more retention,


464
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:26,836
more In-App Purchases.


465
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:29,146
Maybe it's that simple,
and we don't have


466
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:31,236
to release another
version of our app


467
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,896
to get more downloads
in Germany.


468
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:36,136
So this is great.


469
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:38,426
Let's talk about what
it actually looks like


470
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:40,496
and show you guys what
we've been working on.


471
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:41,356
I think that's why we're here.


472
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:45,976
App Analytics shows up as a
new feature inside the new


473
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:46,686
iTunes Connect.


474
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,746
It's here beside My Apps.


475
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,326
The first view that we see


476
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:55,606
when we click inside
Analytics is our App List.


477
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:58,036
This is the older view of
your entire mobile business.


478
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,586
Here, I can see my "Trip
Guider" app at the top.


479
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:03,416
I can see all of my
other apps in my suite.


480
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,346
I can see filters.


481
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:09,526
I can see the ability to
change my time, my date.


482
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:11,476
Let's look at these metrics.


483
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:14,016
So, here is the key
vitals for an application.


484
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:16,016
Going from the left
to the right,


485
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:17,556
I see that lifecycle again.


486
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:18,406
It's consistent.


487
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:20,826
Start with My App Store
views and then My App Units.


488
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:24,026
I see my Sessions and my Sales.


489
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:30,016
See if they're rising,
falling in this period.


490
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,336
I hover over these, I get
tool tips telling me what the


491
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:33,566
previous period was as well.


492
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:35,496
I can select one.


493
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,176
Selecting one of these brings us
into the heart of this product


494
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:39,306
which is our Metrics Page.


495
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,006
The first thing you'll
notice is that great trend.


496
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:43,716
We can see how we're
doing over time


497
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,516
and this situation we're
looking at, data from May.


498
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:50,336
I can see over May that my
application is increasing


499
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:51,926
in App Store views,
which is awesome.


500
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,156
I can also change
my interval below.


501
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:56,746
I can change this from
Days to Weeks to Months.


502
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,406
Let's talk about
those measures again.


503
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:01,946
Here, I have those
lifecycle metrics.


504
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:04,186
I have my Sales, my Store Data.


505
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,006
I have my Engagement
Data, my Device Data.


506
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,866
I can select any of these
and change the chart.


507
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:13,406
Let's look at breaking this
down by a particular platform.


508
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:17,596
I select View By and now I can
see how this actually looks


509
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,306
across all of the Apple devices.


510
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:24,576
I can see my iPhone, my iPad,
my iPod touch, and it looks


511
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,526
like the trend is about
the same on all of them.


512
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:27,996
They're all performing
equally in this case.


513
00:24:27,996 --> 00:24:28,386
It's great.


514
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:31,726
But a customer can't
have an iPhone


515
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:34,306
and an iPad at the same time.


516
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,516
They're not the same device.


517
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,556
They're two different devices.


518
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:38,856
So, we look at that
as a stacked area.


519
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:42,966
I go to Chart Type, I select
Stacked Area, like that.


520
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:47,436
I can now see the composition
of iPhone, iPod, iPod touch,


521
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:50,106
and the sum of these
will equal 100 percent


522
00:24:50,106 --> 00:24:51,436
of whatever metric
I'm looking at.


523
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,676
There's different chart types
for different scenarios,


524
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:59,326
and looking at App Store Views,
here - Area looks the best.


525
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:01,246
We'll choose the
sensible default based


526
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:02,866
on the measure you're
looking at.


527
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,526
Let's swap to another measure.


528
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:06,846
Look at App Store Units.


529
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:08,596
Here, there's no issues here.


530
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:12,616
Analytics is providing an
answer that my conversions


531
00:25:12,616 --> 00:25:16,416
from page views to App Units
hasn't dropped drastically.


532
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:19,056
It's a little bit lower,
but the trend is the same,


533
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:20,966
and on both devices
it's the same.


534
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,146
So, not a lot of opportunity


535
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:26,096
to improve my iPad
App Store presence


536
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:28,216
because it's performing
the same as my iPhone.


537
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:29,486
Maybe I improve them
all together.


538
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:33,026
Let's go to another
measure In-App Purchases,


539
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:37,256
and this is where our team
decided that on May 15th,


540
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,866
we would lower the price
of In-App Purchases,


541
00:25:40,236 --> 00:25:42,806
and as a result, we got
a lot more app purchases


542
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:45,566
that occurred, and we can
see that with App Analytics.


543
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,536
We can see the spike there -


544
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:49,516
we can see that across
all platforms,


545
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:52,946
it performed much better
as a result of our change.


546
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:57,786
We also had intuition


547
00:25:57,786 --> 00:26:01,266
that changing our In-App
Purchases would help give more


548
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,526
customers more content,
and that would result


549
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:05,886
in more engagement,
more active devices.


550
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:10,136
So with that, we select
In-App Purchases, Compare To,


551
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:15,706
select Active Devices, and now
we see our Active Devices went


552
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,326
up as did our In-App Purchases.


553
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,426
I can see these layer on top


554
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:21,306
of each other telling
me the story that, "Yes,


555
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:25,616
our changes to In-App Purchases
really did impact Active Devices


556
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:26,006
as well."


557
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:28,566
We've got more revenue
from our In-App Purchases,


558
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:31,766
and we've got more
retention and more engagement


559
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:32,856
from our Active Devices.


560
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:38,146
So, that's Metrics, and that's
the measures that we provide.


561
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:40,196
There's some questions
we haven't answered yet,


562
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,456
and we're going to
answer that with Sources.


563
00:26:43,986 --> 00:26:45,226
So, what are Sources?


564
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:48,826
Sources are all about
how people find your app.


565
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:51,996
As developers, you work
really hard on your app,


566
00:26:51,996 --> 00:26:56,056
your App Store presence, and
you have no idea right now how


567
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:57,686
people are getting to
your App Store page.


568
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:00,296
We're excited that Sources
solves that problem.


569
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:02,656
There's two types.


570
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:07,386
We have websites, and
we have campaigns.


571
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:08,726
Websites are really simple.


572
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:10,246
It's a link to your
App Store page.


573
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,756
You're familiar with
these links today.


574
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,646
Any time you hand a link to
your friends, to your family,


575
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:18,026
to your marketing sites, that
link is now trapped in the form


576
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:21,446
of a website as a refer,
as a Source, and we can see


577
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:22,676
that in App Analytics.


578
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:26,756
And Campaigns are that same
link with the campaign ID.


579
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,086
This is a friendly
link - friendly name


580
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:30,366
that you supply to the URL.


581
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:32,076
Let's talk about
what that looks like.


582
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:33,366
It's really simple.


583
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:35,706
This is the URL that
hopefully you're familiar with.


584
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:39,006
We add a Provider ID.


585
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:41,946
We get this Provider ID
inside iTunes Connect,


586
00:27:41,946 --> 00:27:44,576
and then you add
your Campaign ID.


587
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,346
Friendly Name, you want
it as friendly as possible


588
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:49,936
because you're going to
view this name afterwards -


589
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:53,166
we'll show you that in a second
- inside your Sources Lists.


590
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:56,176
If you're using iAd today


591
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,816
to advertise your
application, this is automatic.


592
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:03,086
You do not have to go to iAd
and set up campaign names


593
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:05,006
for the purposes
of App Analytics.


594
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:06,916
It will all happen seamlessly.


595
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:10,096
Any campaign you create in iAd
will be automatically tracked


596
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:12,666
and available inside
App Analytics


597
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,546
and you can really
see the effectiveness


598
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:17,236
of that inside App
Analytics without any effort.


599
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:19,706
So what does this look like?


600
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:21,636
Come here, we select Sources


601
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:24,946
and get brought to
the Sources Lists.


602
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:27,086
Here, I see my Top Websites.


603
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:29,146
Beside that I can
see Top Campaigns.


604
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:31,836
I have the same key
vitals that I had


605
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,316
on my application list as well.


606
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:36,876
We're really trying to reinforce
the story of acquisition


607
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:39,456
to engagement and keep it
consistent for you guys.


608
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:43,446
I select Top Campaigns.


609
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:45,276
I get brought over to
my Top Campaigns List.


610
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:48,536
These are a view of all those
friendly names that we set up.


611
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:50,716
Let's zoom in on
one of these here.


612
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:52,296
I can see "Spring Email Blast."


613
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:53,286
That was my friendly name.


614
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:56,756
I see My App Store
views, my units, my sales,


615
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,776
and my sessions,
that same lifecycle.


616
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:00,516
This is great.


617
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:03,896
We select that, and we're
into this Source Details.


618
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:05,886
We think that if
you're marketers,


619
00:29:05,886 --> 00:29:06,916
you're going to love this page.


620
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:07,926
You're going to sit
on this page.


621
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,346
You're going to share
it with your colleagues.


622
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:12,456
We can see all of
those key measures.


623
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,316
It's a nice visual.


624
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,396
We see it broken down
over time as well.


625
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:17,616
Every day has a bar
on these Key Measures.


626
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:19,456
We also see additional measures


627
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:21,826
that you can only get
on the Metrics Page.


628
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:26,936
You can see this broken down by
different data types as well.


629
00:29:26,936 --> 00:29:29,476
So, here we're looking for
App Store views by Region,


630
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,466
by Territory, by Platform.


631
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,226
Changing those dropdowns,
I can change the measure


632
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:36,826
that I'm looking at and see
exactly how this campaign is


633
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:39,686
performing, how this
website is performing,


634
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:43,146
and what exactly the
customers are doing as well.


635
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:47,146
So that's Sources.


636
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:49,236
We think that you're going
to love Sources today.


637
00:29:49,236 --> 00:29:51,256
You know that people are
downloading your app,


638
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,096
installing the app.


639
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:53,906
What you don't know is
where they're coming from,


640
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:55,496
and we're solving that problem.


641
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:59,956
So, we've answered the question,
how are people doing in the app?


642
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:01,926
Are they converting
on Internet purchases?


643
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:02,906
Where are they coming from?


644
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:06,656
We haven't answered in
detail, "Are people returning


645
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:07,936
or are they retained?"


646
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,156
What does that side of
the lifecycle look like?


647
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:11,966
And we answer that
with retention.


648
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:15,636
Let's just do a quick education


649
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:17,096
on retention, why
it's important.


650
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:18,816
This is obvious.


651
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,266
One-hundred percent of your
customers are customers


652
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,136
on the purchased date.


653
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:23,376
It's really simple.


654
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:29,796
Moving along, 45 percent
are customers on Day 2,


655
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:33,866
35 percent on Day 7, and
20 percent on Day 30.


656
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,816
Hopefully these numbers
aren't scary,


657
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,836
but there's an opportunity
there.


658
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:40,596
You can get them higher
and higher - focus on this,


659
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:42,916
it's really important because
if you have no more customers


660
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:46,906
at Day 30 or 90, you're
really going to have to focus


661
00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:49,466
on the next stop or
improving your content


662
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:50,456
in your marketing to get more.


663
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,796
How do we show this in the UI?


664
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,216
Select retention, and I
can see my purchase date


665
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:58,976
on the left, May 23.


666
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:01,866
I can see my days
later on the right.


667
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:06,746
Here I'm looking at Day 7,
and there's a little story.


668
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:10,786
So of the active devices
that purchase on May 23,


669
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:14,786
18 percent remained
active seven days later.


670
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:16,226
This is great - single view


671
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:18,886
of how my retention
on May 23 was doing.


672
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:22,436
As developers, as
marketers, product managers,


673
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:24,386
we want to look at this with all


674
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:26,416
of our purchase dates
stacked on top of each other.


675
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:27,806
So that's the view
that we're providing.


676
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:32,396
The same on May 24th, and
now we show you the rest


677
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:33,156
of this matrix.


678
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:35,946
So, May 23rd to June 3rd,


679
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:39,506
I can see my retention
stacked a single quick view


680
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,596
of how my Day 7 retention is,


681
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:45,016
and you don't have
to do anything.


682
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:45,886
This is amazing.


683
00:31:46,046 --> 00:31:47,966
So, we're providing -

[ Applause ]


685
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:59,086
- metrics, sources,
retention, your app list.


686
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:00,326
What do you need to do?


687
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:05,626
Nothing. There's no SDK,
no third party code running


688
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:06,976
in your apps, no
performance degradation.

[ Applause ]


690
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:14,426
You don't have to
write any new code.


691
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:18,326
This is not an Apple provided
library that you have to embed


692
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:20,436
in your app, and you don't
have to instantiate it,


693
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:22,686
initialize it, no
code is required,


694
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:25,116
no app updates required.


695
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:27,456
You do not have to
recompile, re-sign,


696
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:28,836
resubmit your app to the store.


697
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:31,676
You really have to do nothing
to take advantage of this.


698
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:34,106
We're doing this
because it's all built


699
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:36,286
into the App Store and iOS 8.


700
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:40,346
Everything from the store
metrics to the sales metrics,


701
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,246
to the device metrics,
this is all automatic


702
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:43,386
in the App Store in iOS 8.


703
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:48,146
And what have we kept in
mind while doing this?


704
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:52,326
Privacy. So App Analytics has
been a really highly requested


705
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:53,856
feature of iTunes Connect.


706
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:56,236
We're excited to bring it to
you guys, and we're excited


707
00:32:56,236 --> 00:32:58,556
to bring it to you with
privacy at the forefront.


708
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:02,176
We're not in this
business to sell your data;


709
00:33:02,586 --> 00:33:03,476
we're not in this business


710
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:05,926
to write informative blog
posts about your data.


711
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:09,836
Apple is providing App Analytics
as a service to the developers,


712
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:12,986
and we love our customers
as much as you do,


713
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:15,206
and we respect their
privacy as much


714
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:16,576
as we know you would
like to as well.


715
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:20,106
Rest assured that as we're
building this product,


716
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:23,226
as this product rolls out, the
privacy is at the forefront.


717
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,606
We're not making any
compromises in this area.


718
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:27,146
We're really excited about that,


719
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:29,286
and we think that's
a really unique thing


720
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:29,996
that we're offering.


721
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,076
Finally, maybe the
best news: It's free.


722
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:35,976
App Analytics is
completely free.

going to love this.

We think that you're going

00:33:50,846 --> 00:33:53,096
to love the setup
time, which is nothing.

Love the cost; we're
excited about this feature.

00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:58,986
With that, I like to
bring up Daniel to talk


731
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,646
about TestFlight Beta Testing.

>> Thanks Trystan.


734
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,426
Hi, my name is Daniel Miao.


735
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:10,626
I'm a Software Engineer
on iTunes Connect.


736
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:14,186
Now, most of you heard during
Tim's keynote on Monday


737
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:16,206
that we're announcing
TestFlight Beta Testing.


738
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,346
Well we're very excited to
have this opportunity today


739
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:21,696
to bring you more details
about this great feature.


740
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,696
Now, before we get started,


741
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:29,196
how many of you used
TestFlight in the past?


742
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:33,496
Great. Well whether you've
used TestFlight or not,


743
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:35,456
I'm sure we can all agree


744
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:39,485
that great beta testing
tools go a long way.


745
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:47,206
We'd all like to see less
of these, and more of these.


746
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:51,576
So before we get into the
details, let's talk a little bit


747
00:34:51,576 --> 00:34:53,866
about the history of
beta distribution.


748
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:56,775
In the beginning,


749
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:02,486
beta distribution
looked a lot like this.


750
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:06,286
Whenever you wanted to test
your app on your device,


751
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,846
you would connect your
device to your computer,


752
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:11,476
transfer your binary
over and test from there.


753
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:15,696
At some point you probably
decided it'd be helpful


754
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,496
to have others also take a look


755
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:19,576
at your app before you
publish it to the App Store.


756
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:22,556
So each time you
wanted to add a tester,


757
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:25,196
you would ask the tester
for the device UDID.


758
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:28,116
You would go to the
developer portal,


759
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:30,096
set up provisioning profiles.


760
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:34,346
And then you would send
your tester the binary.


761
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:36,896
They would connect their
device to their computer,


762
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,656
transfer the binary over,
and they would start testing.


763
00:35:40,006 --> 00:35:41,816
Of course you would
have to do this


764
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,466
for every single
one of your testers.


765
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:47,436
So, what do we do for
you during this period?


766
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,386
How did we change your beta
distribution experience?


767
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:54,916
Well we went from this, to this.


768
00:35:54,916 --> 00:36:00,026
We think we can do better.


769
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:02,846
With the new TestFlight
Beta Testing platform,


770
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:15,146
you can distribute your apps
to not one, not 100, not 500,


771
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:21,686
but up to 1,000 testers.

[ Applause ]


773
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:30,096
Now these are testers,
not devices.


774
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:36,446
In fact, each of your testers
can test on multiple devices.


775
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:42,286
Next, UDID and provisioning
profiles.


776
00:36:46,216 --> 00:36:47,976
You no longer need
to worry about these.

[ Applause ]


778
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:59,986
All you need to get a tester
started is an email address.


779
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:02,086
So let's talk a little bit


780
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,556
about the two sides
of the new platform.


781
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:07,576
You start out in iTunes Connect.


782
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:09,716
As you work on your project,


783
00:37:09,716 --> 00:37:11,356
you upload your builds
to iTunes Connect.


784
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:15,156
And from iTunes Connect you
can manage these builds,


785
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:20,946
manage the testers, distribute
these builds to your testers,


786
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:25,066
and as they're testing,
you can come back


787
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:27,246
to get insight into
their activity.


788
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:33,986
Now once your testers receive
an invitation to TestFlight,


789
00:37:34,826 --> 00:37:40,056
I mean to to test your app, they
download the TestFlight iOS app,


790
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:43,196
and from here they can
manage what apps they want,


791
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:43,786
they're testing.


792
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:47,696
They can perform one-tap
installs and updates,


793
00:37:47,736 --> 00:37:51,546
and they can send you feedback.


794
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:57,896
So, while we were working on
these features, we discovered


795
00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:01,416
that building great apps
requires a flexible process,


796
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:05,066
everything from iterating
with your development team


797
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,306
to distributing to
a wider audience,


798
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:10,766
so we came up with
internal and beta testers.


799
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:16,326
Now internal testers are made
up of your iTunes Connect users.


800
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:21,756
A beta tester is anyone
with an email address.


801
00:38:22,106 --> 00:38:26,586
You can have up to 25
internal testers and up


802
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:30,196
to 1,000 beta testers.


803
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:35,406
As you upload builds
to iTunes Connect,


804
00:38:35,526 --> 00:38:38,126
your internal testers
will have access


805
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:43,446
to these builds right away, and
beta app review will be required


806
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,366
to unlock your 1,000 testers.


807
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:48,736
But while your build is in
review, you can continue


808
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:51,586
to upload new builds, and your
internal testers can continue


809
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:53,496
to test, and you can continue


810
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,606
to manage your testers
in iTunes Connect.


811
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:00,496
Finally, Sandbox Accounts.


812
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:04,626
As each of your testers
signs into the iOS App


813
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:09,176
for the first time, they'll
automatically have a Sandbox


814
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:11,046
Account created for them.


815
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,426
What this means is that
you don't need to come


816
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:15,556
into iTunes Connect anymore
to create test accounts.


817
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:18,526
We want your testers to be
able to test all aspects


818
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:21,296
of your application
including in-app purchases.


819
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:25,706
So let's see what
this all looks like.


820
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:31,246
Here we are, we're back
on the version page


821
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:35,376
of the new iTunes Connect, and
you'll notice a Prerelease tab.


822
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:39,656
If you click this, we'll
see a list of the builds


823
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:41,016
that we uploaded in Xcode.


824
00:39:41,936 --> 00:39:44,746
So let's say you want to
test build number 103.


825
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:48,416
In order to do this, we
first have to enter metadata


826
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,826
for our testers so they
have something to see


827
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:51,916
when they receive
their invitation.


828
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:59,786
So we click into this build, we
enter things like a description,


829
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:03,086
and we also tell the
tester what we like them


830
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:08,146
to test specifically
on this build.


831
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:14,346
After we've had this information
inputted, we hit Save,


832
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:16,186
and we come back
to the Build List.


833
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:21,346
Once we're on the Build
List, we come to the corner,


834
00:40:22,426 --> 00:40:25,356
we click the Testing
Switch, turn on testing,


835
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,866
and that build is now available
to our internal testers.


836
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:33,626
So let's say we want
to upload another build


837
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:40,406
to our internal testers, keep
entering, maybe upload one more.


838
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:44,856
Now, we're confident that
105 is a build that we want


839
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:47,816
to distribute more broadly
to our beta testers.


840
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:52,166
In order to do this, we
click the Submit button next


841
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:57,386
to the build, and after review,


842
00:40:58,036 --> 00:41:00,306
this is now also available
to our beta testers.


843
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:04,396
You'll notice here that
there's a 30-day expiration


844
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:06,386
on this build so we know
exactly when we need


845
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:08,436
to upload the next
build for our testers.


846
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:14,416
Now let's take a look at
managing beta testers.


847
00:41:18,856 --> 00:41:20,896
Here we are on the
Beta Testers list.


848
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:25,046
We see everybody that
we added or invited.


849
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:26,836
We see what they're doing.


850
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:29,826
We can see that some of our
testers have installed the app


851
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:30,966
and they're already testing.


852
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:34,086
Some of them have
accepted the invite


853
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:35,536
but haven't installed yet,


854
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:39,776
and some have not even
accepted the invitations yet.


855
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:43,046
For the ones who have installed,
we see the latest build


856
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:43,806
that they've installed.


857
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:50,006
And if we want to add another
tester, we come up here


858
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:52,726
to the top, we click
the Plus button,


859
00:41:53,296 --> 00:41:58,686
add a few email addresses,
hit Submit


860
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:02,036
and those testers
are ready to go.


861
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:03,536
So that's iTunes Connect side.


862
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:06,866
Now let's take a look at the
tester experience in iOS.


863
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:09,756
Here we are on the device.


864
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,696
This is the "Mail" app,
and this is an invitation


865
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,316
that we received
from a developer.


866
00:42:15,156 --> 00:42:17,846
We see the name of the app that
we've been invited to test,


867
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:21,146
and we see a link that
says, open in TestFlight.


868
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:24,646
So let's go ahead and tap that.


869
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:26,826
Here we are in the
TestFlight app;


870
00:42:27,446 --> 00:42:32,786
from here we can install our
app, and once we've done that,


871
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:35,766
we can just start testing.


872
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:38,426
Few things to note here
is the Send Feedback link.


873
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:43,666
You, as a tester, can
tap this to send feedback


874
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:44,766
to your developer via email.


875
00:42:47,036 --> 00:42:49,076
There's also the What to
Test section, which we talked


876
00:42:49,076 --> 00:42:52,976
about earlier, the developer
telling us what they like us


877
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:56,976
to test specifically
on the latest build.


878
00:42:57,776 --> 00:43:00,216
Now if we tap the TestFlight
link in the top corner,


879
00:43:00,216 --> 00:43:04,666
this will take us
back to a list of apps


880
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,766
that we're actively testing.


881
00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:09,166
From here we can open any of
these apps, we can take a look


882
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:10,656
at What to Test notes
and we can look


883
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:11,716
at the version we're testing.


884
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:18,416
Now let's go back to the
Home screen for a minute.


885
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:20,446
Here, we see the
app we've installed,


886
00:43:20,446 --> 00:43:24,066
and we'll see a badge, a little
orange badge next to the name


887
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:26,946
of the app that we
just installed.


888
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:29,796
This indicates that this app
is currently being tested;


889
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:33,646
it's a beta build of the app.


890
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:35,216
And oh, what's this?


891
00:43:35,986 --> 00:43:36,916
We got a notification.


892
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:40,076
This is telling us that
there's a new build available


893
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:40,776
for us to test.


894
00:43:41,696 --> 00:43:45,916
So if you tap that,
it'll take us back


895
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,826
into the app, into TestFlight.


896
00:43:48,596 --> 00:43:54,216
From here we can update the
app, and we're on our way.


897
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:59,546
And that's TestFlight,
the iOS App.


898
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:05,856
So in summary, we can have
up to 1,000 testers for each


899
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:09,446
of our apps with beta testing.


900
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:12,676
We no longer need to manage
UDID's or provisioning profiles.


901
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:16,766
We can perform one-tap
installs and updates.


902
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:22,936
Sandbox Accounts are
automatically created


903
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:26,386
for our testers to be able
to test, and our purchases,


904
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:30,616
and is all new TestFlight
for iOS.


905
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:34,126
And that's Beta Testing.


906
00:44:34,566 --> 00:44:35,966
Back to Dave.


907
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:43,406
[ Applause ]


908
00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:45,526
>> All right, thank you Daniel.


909
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:51,836
We have a few things to wrap
up here before we conclude.


910
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:55,366
Every year we ask App
Review if you had a few tips


911
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:57,016
and tricks we can
give to developers


912
00:44:57,576 --> 00:44:59,846
at a developers' conference,
what would they be?


913
00:45:00,646 --> 00:45:02,286
App Review does a great job.


914
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:04,116
I looked right before
I got on stage.


915
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:07,276
Ninety-four percent of all
updates review within five days.


916
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:09,306
And here are some suggestions


917
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:13,476
that can help get your
app through app review.


918
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:15,836
Number 1, app name
versus keywords:


919
00:45:17,186 --> 00:45:20,256
Your app name is not place to
list all those different words


920
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:23,086
that you want people to search
on so they can find your app.


921
00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:27,086
That's what keywords are for.


922
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:32,766
IDFA, if you serve ads, then
ads must be present in your app.


923
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:38,256
The description and screenshots
must match your app -


924
00:45:38,686 --> 00:45:41,266
and I would add to this -
App Preview will probably be


925
00:45:41,266 --> 00:45:42,076
on this list next year.


926
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:45,166
When you're ready to
submit In-App Purchases


927
00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:47,606
for review you need to
make sure that all aspects


928
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:48,656
of the In-App Purchase work.


929
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,656
If you need a service
up and running


930
00:45:50,656 --> 00:45:53,156
so the auto renewables work,
that needs to be ready,


931
00:45:54,616 --> 00:45:56,696
not when your In-App Purchase
is live on the App Store


932
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:58,686
but when you submit
it to App Review.


933
00:45:59,996 --> 00:46:01,636
If your app gets
metadata rejected,


934
00:46:02,786 --> 00:46:05,026
and you submit it again
without making a change


935
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:09,366
to that metadata, it will just
get rejected a second time.


936
00:46:09,546 --> 00:46:13,416
I say that because they say it
happens - just a friendly note.


937
00:46:14,886 --> 00:46:17,826
As always, make sure you have
rights for all the content,


938
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,386
the keywords in your app.


939
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:23,426
This would apply to screenshots,
app previews, anything.


940
00:46:23,966 --> 00:46:26,396
And lastly, testing.


941
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,426
I'm very happy this
has lowered itself


942
00:46:30,426 --> 00:46:31,466
down on the list this year.


943
00:46:31,996 --> 00:46:37,126
One thing of note is that, if
you're building an iPhone app,


944
00:46:37,746 --> 00:46:39,836
it needs to also
work on an iPad.


945
00:46:40,386 --> 00:46:44,846
Not to be outdone, the Apps
Mission Team said, "Hey,


946
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:48,636
we have some suggestions, want
to help people some things


947
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:52,916
to think about before they
submit their app to App Review".


948
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,426
IDFA again - answers
these questions correctly


949
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:56,176
in iTunes Connect.


950
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:58,386
If you serve ads using IDFA,


951
00:46:58,386 --> 00:47:01,686
make sure you answer those
questions the right way.


952
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:04,266
We get a fair number
of apps delivered


953
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:05,556
but don't have all
the right icons.


954
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:08,456
Make sure all your
required icons are


955
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:10,346
in your project before
you submit.


956
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:13,666
Toolchains and bad signature:


957
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:17,656
These kinds of invalid binary
messages can all be solved


958
00:47:17,656 --> 00:47:20,956
by making sure that you
upload and create your app


959
00:47:21,236 --> 00:47:23,526
in the latest version of Xcode.


960
00:47:24,186 --> 00:47:26,696
And Mac app sandboxing, if
you're going to send a Mac


961
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:29,196
out to the App Store, make
sure you check that box


962
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:31,066
in Xcode before doing so.


963
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:35,466
A little note about
iTunes Connect for iOS:


964
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:38,696
I hope many of you already
gotten the latest update;


965
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:39,896
we released it a few weeks ago.


966
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:43,456
This was our first foray
or step into the redesign.


967
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:47,926
Updated pages, sells and trends.


968
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,156
Take a look at your five
week, your two week,


969
00:47:51,156 --> 00:47:54,096
your 26 weeks information.


970
00:47:54,646 --> 00:47:57,076
New page view.


971
00:47:57,076 --> 00:47:59,656
iTunes Connect for iOS.


972
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:02,376
At the palm of your hand you can
release the latest version live


973
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:03,006
into the App Store.


974
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:10,576
So today we talked about the
new design for iTunes Connect;,


975
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:17,096
a nice new UI as well as
cleaner flows; app previews,


976
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:20,616
15 to 30 seconds
of dynamic video


977
00:48:21,286 --> 00:48:23,166
so you can show what
makes your app magical.


978
00:48:23,716 --> 00:48:28,856
App bundles: Bundle up to
10 of your apps together,


979
00:48:30,146 --> 00:48:33,156
providing people in the
App Store with one install


980
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:34,736
to get all of these apps.


981
00:48:35,906 --> 00:48:39,676
App Analytics - this is the
best end-to-end view of your app


982
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:41,996
with data that only
Apple can provide.


983
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:44,476
And TestFlight Beta Testing.


984
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:47,856
If you haven't been beta
testing your apps until now,


985
00:48:47,856 --> 00:48:51,056
you have no reason not to.


986
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:53,226
Just like iOS 8 and
OS X Yosemite,


987
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:55,926
these features will be
released later this fall.


988
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:59,526
For more information,
you can write to write


989
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:01,066
to evangelism@apple.com.


990
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:03,466
There's a Contact Us
form on iTunes Connect -


991
00:49:04,016 --> 00:49:05,336
this really is the best way


992
00:49:05,336 --> 00:49:07,246
to get your questions
answered by the right person.


993
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:08,526
It can take a lot time


994
00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:10,616
to navigate those
emails based off your


995
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:12,346
questions appropriately.


996
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:15,466
There's iTunes Connect
Dev Guide you can get


997
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:19,366
on developer.apple.com as
well as the dev forms -


998
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:20,566
lots of good information there.


999
00:49:22,056 --> 00:49:24,726
We have some related
sessions later today:


1000
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:26,046
"Optimizing In-App Purchases."


1001
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,006
If you have any questions
on how exactly


1002
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,956
to use In-App Purchases,
check that out.


1003
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:32,186
"What's New in iAd Workbench."


1004
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:37,226
As Trystan mentioned, privacy
matters, so we have a session


1005
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:41,556
on "User Privacy

This is a great session
where we'll talk about that


1009
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:50,146
and show how we used it in
creating iTunes Connect for iOS.

mentioned earlier about

the bash tomorrow.

I encourage you to check
that one out as well.


1014
00:49:58,656 --> 00:49:59,766
And with that, that's
all we have today,

and rest of the conference.
