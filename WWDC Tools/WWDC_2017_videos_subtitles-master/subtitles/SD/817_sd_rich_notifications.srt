[ Bell Ring ]


2
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:27,806
>> You guys know that sound,


3
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:27,896
right?


4
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:29,826
You know, you've probably seen


5
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:30,676
that badge before.


6
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,485
I know we're all familiar with


7
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,336
notifications.


8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,226
And often they're really, really


9
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:35,906
great.


10
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:36,596
You know, there's lots of


11
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:37,806
reasons to be excited when you


12
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:38,606
hear that sound.


13
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:40,206
Maybe it's an iMessage you're


14
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,626
eagerly awaiting, your favorite


15
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,586
app has something to share,


16
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,376
maybe you've got something on


17
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:45,526
social media that is just


18
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:46,746
totally blowing up.


19
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,186
Like, notifications, they're


20
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:49,646
really fun and they're a big


21
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:51,326
reason we love our iPhones so


22
00:00:51,326 --> 00:00:51,656
much.


23
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,186
But I think as we all know maybe


24
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,036
too much of a good thing is not


25
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,276
always such a good thing, right?


26
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,416
And I would imagine there's a


27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,816
few of you that have some apps


28
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:02,826
that look like this, right?


29
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:04,456
So let's talk about what we can


30
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,196
do to make sure all these


31
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:06,656
notifications are something


32
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:07,136
really great?


33
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,686
So first off, let's be mindful


34
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:11,496
of people's time.


35
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:12,376
You know, we should send


36
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:13,606
notifications only when they're


37
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,126
relevant.


38
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:15,286
Don't spam.


39
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,486
Don't send them to boost traffic


40
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:19,286
or engagement, but only when


41
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,326
your app has some important


42
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,266
information to share.


43
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:23,136
When asking for permission to


44
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,526
send them, you know, be clear


45
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:24,886
why.


46
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,276
Explain what notifications are


47
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:28,196
going to be about, and the value


48
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:29,066
that they will provide.


49
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:30,406
You know, because there is a


50
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,816
real consequence if you send too


51
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:33,696
many and they're not informative


52
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,296
or useful.


53
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:35,266
You know, people can shut them


54
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,816
off, or maybe even delete your


55
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:37,086
app.


56
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:38,276
And nobody wants that.


57
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:40,136
I'd like to stress this point


58
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:40,296
here.


59
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:42,206
Don't think of notifications as


60
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:43,266
just a hook into your app.


61
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:44,906
You know, they should be a


62
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,516
self-contained package of


63
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:48,126
information that allows you to


64
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:49,366
complete a specific task.


65
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:51,056
Because if someone does interact


66
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,076
with your notification, we want


67
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,046
to make sure it is worthwhile to


68
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:53,246
them.


69
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,366
Because if you create delightful


70
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,736
and useful notifications, there


71
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,676
is a real opportunity to create


72
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,486
a bond between people and your


73
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:01,846
app, and that is going to create


74
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:03,346
a real value for you as


75
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:05,206
developers, and real value for


76
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:06,666
everyone that uses your app.


77
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:09,496
So, to make sure we're on the


78
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,146
same page here, let's talk about


79
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,786
what makes a rich notification.


80
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,906
Starting with a Short Look, this


81
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:17,486
should answer the question: What


82
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:18,686
is this notification about?


83
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:20,706
So when you're creating these,


84
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:21,736
make sure you're following the


85
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:22,226
current APIs.


86
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,666
You know, we just had some


87
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,276
updates in iOS 11, take


88
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:26,076
advantage of those.


89
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,266
We want to make sure you


90
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,046
populate all the proper fields


91
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:29,746
and labels.


92
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:31,256
And take a minute to make sure


93
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,396
the language that you're using


94
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:34,476
here is clear, informative and


95
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:34,796
direct.


96
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:38,076
So now if you use 3D Touch and


97
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:39,326
you press on the notification,


98
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,786
you get what we like to call the


99
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,296
Long Look.


100
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,846
And here is where you should


101
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:45,486
provide some additional context,


102
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:47,286
some additional information


103
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:48,366
around your notification.


104
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:50,286
So here, you can see in the


105
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:52,006
calendar notification I get more


106
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,186
details about the event, and I


107
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,746
get to see a detail of my day,


108
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:57,406
and that's the extra content


109
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,136
that makes this really valuable.


110
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:00,686
It's nice to know more about the


111
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:01,996
event, but it is really helpful


112
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:03,056
in this case to know if I'm


113
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:04,956
free, because at the bottom of


114
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,346
the notification there can be


115
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:07,616
some optional Quick Actions.


116
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:08,906
So if it relates to the


117
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,666
notification, add some relevant


118
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,076
buttons.


119
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,576
Remember, we want people to see


120
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,146
the alert, get the information


121
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:15,626
they need, do what they need to


122
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:16,986
do, and then get back to what


123
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:17,806
they were just doing.


124
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,046
So now that I know that I'm


125
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:20,646
free, I can go on and I can


126
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:21,566
accept the invitation.


127
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:22,826
I never had to launch the


128
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,456
calendar app, and I never lost


129
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:25,736
context of what I was doing.


130
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,166
So in creating a notification,


131
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,296
remember, the Short Look should


132
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,496
describe what the notification


133
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:32,186
is about.


134
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:33,786
The Long Look should provide


135
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:34,956
some contextually relevant


136
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,496
information, and the Quick


137
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:37,906
Actions should provide some


138
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,126
quick actions.


139
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:42,556
So let's get into some examples


140
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,506
now of what great, rich


141
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,316
notifications look like, and all


142
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:46,296
the different things you can do.


143
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,396
So here is a notification for


144
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:49,596
mail.


145
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:50,516
And you can see you are


146
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,326
presented with the sender's


147
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:52,816
name, the subject of the


148
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,126
message, and a few lines of


149
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:54,736
preview.


150
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,626
Now, when I expand this open, I


151
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:58,576
get to see the rest of the


152
00:03:58,576 --> 00:03:59,096
message.


153
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:01,086
So at a minimum, this is what we


154
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:01,696
want to be doing.


155
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,146
And if you've got some content


156
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,526
that gets truncated in the Short


157
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,266
Look, let's show the rest of it


158
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:07,006
in the Long Look.


159
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:10,656
The next thing we can do to make


160
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:12,296
notifications more useful is by


161
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:12,996
adding an image.


162
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:14,676
So here is Photos, sending a


163
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:15,386
notification.


164
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,935
You can see the stream it was


165
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:17,805
posted to.


166
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,486
You could see who posted it, and


167
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:20,446
there is a thumbnail on the


168
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:21,245
right-hand side there.


169
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,446
Those are all helpful bits of


170
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:23,036
information.


171
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:25,446
Now, in this Long Look, I can


172
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:26,816
just see a big version of the


173
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,106
photo and some relevant quick


174
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:28,496
actions.


175
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,006
So remember here, when you're


176
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,666
adding an image, it doesn't need


177
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,826
to be just a photograph.


178
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:34,146
This is where you can use some


179
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:34,776
of your app UI.


180
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,086
So if you have custom UI, custom


181
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:39,346
typography, elements that make


182
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,776
your app unique, you should add


183
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:41,396
them here.


184
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,396
You know, just like our calendar


185
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,386
example from before.


186
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:45,526
Or if you have a data-heavy app,


187
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,056
maybe you have charts and


188
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:49,136
graphs, flow diagrams, things


189
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:50,536
like that, you can add those.


190
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:51,916
If you have a weather app, maybe


191
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,316
you should show the conditions


192
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,736
graphically, present stock


193
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:57,136
charts if that's your app.


194
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:58,936
You know, show information as


195
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:01,526
it's designed in your app.


196
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,376
Here you can see when Tips


197
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,916
presents a notification, they


198
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,076
tell you what it is, right in


199
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:07,616
the Short Look.


200
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,026
Now, when you expand it, this


201
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,216
notification really comes to


202
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:14,116
life with video content and


203
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:15,446
plays a movie, and it shows you


204
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:15,726
the tip.


205
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,366
It's an example where I don't


206
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,756
need to go into the app to learn


207
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:19,636
what the tip is about.


208
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,746
I get all the information I need


209
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,836
right in the video in line with


210
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,406
the Long Look.


211
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,136
So I think a nice example here


212
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:26,946
might be for games.


213
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,476
You know I think if you're


214
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:29,776
playing chess or some other


215
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,256
turn-by-turn game like that, you


216
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:32,326
know, when someone makes a move,


217
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,526
you can show their last turn


218
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:34,366
back to them right in the


219
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,006
notification.


220
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:37,646
Now remember, these examples are


221
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:39,056
bringing notifications to life


222
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:40,076
with UI animations.


223
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:41,286
And if those are a big part of


224
00:05:41,286 --> 00:05:42,526
your app, use those in the


225
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:43,206
notifications.


226
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,076
But you can also have


227
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,716
traditional video content here


228
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:46,226
as well.


229
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:47,736
So if you have news clips,


230
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,606
sports highlights, things like


231
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:51,216
that, if video is a part of your


232
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,386
app, make that a part of your


233
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:52,936
notifications.


234
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:55,836
So here is a Missed Call in


235
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:56,886
Voicemail notification.


236
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,616
I can see my friend, Chance, he


237
00:05:58,616 --> 00:05:59,626
gave me a call, left a


238
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,116
voicemail.


239
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:01,996
And when I get to the Long Look


240
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:03,556
here, I can see the missed call,


241
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:04,836
I can listen to the audio


242
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:06,006
message or I can just read the


243
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:07,836
transcription, all without ever


244
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:09,026
having to go into the phone app.


245
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,786
Everything I need to know about


246
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:11,796
the missed call is here, the


247
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:13,356
audio, the transcript, and some


248
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:14,066
relevant actions.


249
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:15,646
It's a nice, self-contained


250
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:16,086
package.


251
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:19,776
So we've talked about you can


252
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,586
add images, you can add video,


253
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:22,876
audio to your notifications,


254
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,136
well the next thing you could do


255
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:25,576
is have a custom view that


256
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:26,236
updates live.


257
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,616
So here is Find My Friends.


258
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:28,586
Chance wants to share his


259
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:29,336
location with me.


260
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,936
And when I expand this


261
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:32,256
notification, I get to see his


262
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:33,066
current location.


263
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:35,046
So you can update the content of


264
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,476
a Long Look in real time.


265
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:37,796
So any case where you're using a


266
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,396
map, that is a nice example.


267
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,276
So if you have a social app, you


268
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,756
could see your friends, maybe


269
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:43,976
some sort of delivery service,


270
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:45,626
flight tracking, things like


271
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:46,206
that.


272
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:47,896
Or if you have dynamic data in


273
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:48,726
your app, something that is


274
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,086
based on live events, update


275
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:50,686
that too.


276
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:52,306
Stock prices, sports scores,


277
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:54,896
social feeds, things like that.


278
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:55,986
If your app updates in real


279
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:57,516
time, your notifications should


280
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:58,296
update in real time.


281
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,606
And finally, you can go totally


282
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,016
custom and build a really rich


283
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:03,916
[inaudible] experience.


284
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,086
So I can see my friend Chance,


285
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:08,026
he sends me an iMessage, when I


286
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,386
expand this, I see Messages


287
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,026
draws the actual conversation,


288
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,396
straight with bobbles and


289
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:13,596
effects, and images and


290
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:15,666
attachments, and because the


291
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,046
thread updates live, if he


292
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:18,976
starts typing, we present the


293
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:19,546
indicator.


294
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:20,746
And I think that is a really


295
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,176
helpful piece of information


296
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,526
because it lets me know to keep


297
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,146
the notification open for just a


298
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,216
moment longer, because when he


299
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:28,596
sends his next message, the


300
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,986
thread updates, and it appears


301
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:30,546
right inline.


302
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,076
Now, if I want to engage in the


303
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,756
conversation I can reply to him,


304
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:35,126
and we can go back and forth,


305
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,926
and keep our conversation going


306
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:37,806
until we're through.


307
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,436
Once we're done chatting, I just


308
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:40,856
swipe the notification away, and


309
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:41,986
I get back to what I was just


310
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:42,216
doing.


311
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:46,036
So, Mic is a really cool app


312
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,896
that builds a big part of their


313
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:48,846
experience around our


314
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:49,926
notification platform.


315
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,336
So I can see they posted a


316
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,736
Breaking News alert about a


317
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:54,446
secret government spacecraft, I


318
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:54,716
think.


319
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:55,626
You know that sounds pretty


320
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:56,766
cool, let me read that story.


321
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,986
So when I expand the Long Look,


322
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:00,926
I get to see a big photograph


323
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:01,856
from the article.


324
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,616
I get the headline, and I get to


325
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,836
read the rest of the story.


326
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:06,066
I think it's really great.


327
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,026
You know, I expanded this


328
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,046
notification because I was


329
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:09,726
interested in the story and now


330
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:10,776
I get to read the whole thing,


331
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,256
and I never lost context of what


332
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:12,726
I was doing.


333
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:17,186
Castro is my favorite podcast


334
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:17,466
app.


335
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:18,246
It's really great.


336
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:19,726
It's really well done, and I get


337
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:20,756
a notification every time there


338
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:21,456
is a new episode.


339
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,536
So here, in the Long Look, I get


340
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:25,886
to see the title, there's the


341
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,316
duration, there's a nice


342
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:28,706
description, and even a


343
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:30,036
thumbnail of the show's artwork


344
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:30,856
there in the bottom right.


345
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:32,366
And what's nice here is that


346
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:33,626
it's typeset just like their


347
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:34,256
app.


348
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:35,336
So I think this is a really nice


349
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:37,145
example of how an app can bring


350
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:38,515
their custom design language


351
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:39,826
from their app into the


352
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:41,076
notification experience.


353
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,306
It's really well considered.


354
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:42,986
It is really great.


355
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,706
And the Quick Actions are nice,


356
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:44,986
too.


357
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:46,016
You know, now that I've learned


358
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,746
more about the show, I can just


359
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:48,326
start listening.


360
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,126
And finally, Kuna.


361
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:53,326
This is one of my favorite


362
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:53,836
examples.


363
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,306
You know, this is a smart camera


364
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,466
that you can place by your front


365
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:56,826
door.


366
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:58,326
So here, you get a notification


367
00:08:58,326 --> 00:08:59,326
letting you know that your


368
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:00,476
camera has detected some


369
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:01,456
activity outside.


370
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,596
And I just think this is like


371
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:04,956
the perfect case for a Long


372
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:05,166
Look.


373
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,086
You know, if you are telling me


374
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,596
someone is at my front door, you


375
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:08,556
know, I want to see it, right?


376
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,656
Like, I just want to play the


377
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:11,356
video back right in the Long


378
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:11,606
Look.


379
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:12,776
So let's see what was happening


380
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:13,246
outside.


381
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:14,916
It looks like my friend, Chance,


382
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,546
is stopping by [laughter], oh,


383
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:18,266
that's funny.


384
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,766
There's a real video for this


385
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:20,326
camera, too.


386
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:21,136
He's okay.


387
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,716
And the click actions, too, "Can


388
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:23,146
I help you?"


389
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,756
I think that's nice [laughter].


390
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:27,856
All right, so let's recap here.


391
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:29,526
Let's make sure the Short Look


392
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,136
is giving you clear information


393
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,266
about what the notification is


394
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:32,636
for.


395
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:34,866
Let's make sure the Long Look is


396
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,226
providing more context around


397
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,656
the notification and bringing


398
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:38,616
out some of those wonderful


399
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:39,966
design details from your apps


400
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:41,316
into the notifications.


401
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:43,646
Let's make sure we have some


402
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:44,596
relevant Actions.


403
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:45,816
Remember, I am going to be able


404
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,046
to do everything I need to do,


405
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:47,966
and just take care of the


406
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:48,616
notification.


407
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:50,066
You know, because if we all get


408
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,546
together and we do that, the


409
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:54,346
next time you hear this [bell


410
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:54,906
rings], and the next time you


411
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:56,866
see this, we won't have to


412
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,236
worry, because we will know all


413
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,186
those notifications will be


414
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:00,116
something that is really great.


415
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:01,576
Thank you.
