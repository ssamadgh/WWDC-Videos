00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:28,616
[ Applause ]


2
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:32,406
>> SAL SOGHOIAN: Whoa, thank
you and welcome to Session 306,


3
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:36,016
Supporting the Enterprise
with OS X Automation.


4
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,436
I am Sal Soghoian.


5
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:41,296
I am the Product Manager
for Automation Technologies


6
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:45,506
at Apple, and I'm
excited to be here today.


7
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:49,556
Some days I feel like I'm a
dinosaur looking for a tar pit,


8
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,736
but today is not
one of those days.


9
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:56,056
We're here to talk
about automation


10
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,636
and how it can be used
in production situations,


11
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:05,385
how it can be used within your
organization to address some


12
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:08,206
of the tasks and challenges
that often come up.


13
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:15,626
And before we begin, I just want
to make it clear in our minds


14
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:21,756
that when you talk about an
enterprise you're actually


15
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:23,586
talking about people.


16
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:27,586
People are what comprise
an enterprise


17
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:30,626
and make it successful, they
are the people that come


18
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:32,856
up with the creativity,
they are the ones


19
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:35,166
that implement solutions,
they are the ones


20
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,536
that create solutions.


21
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,426
You are those kind of people.


22
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:42,186
You look for a problem, and
you look for ways to solve it.


23
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:46,836
So throughout this talk today,
I'm always going to look


24
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:51,596
at things from a people
perspective, so let's keep


25
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:55,706
that in mind as we look at
the enterprise and automation.


26
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,086
And specifically when
you're creating a solution,


27
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,226
or I call them a workflow,
there's some strategies


28
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:05,186
that could be useful to follow


29
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,286
when you're designing
a solution.


30
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:11,886
And the first is use
a variety of tools.


31
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:15,636
It's interesting that
you have to mention this,


32
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:19,526
but people often get locked
into a one-tool concept.


33
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:24,946
Don't solve everything with
a hammer because then all


34
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,146
of the problems appear
to be nails.


35
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:30,076
Use the right tool for the job,


36
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:33,296
don't try to drive a
nail with a wrench.


37
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:38,786
You know, use the right tool
that gives you the ability


38
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,996
to accomplish what you
need to accomplish.


39
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:48,736
And, as well, make
your workflows modular


40
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:52,036
so that you can take the
individual components


41
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:56,966
of a workflow and adjust them or
connect them in different ways


42
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,476
or use them in other
solutions as well.


43
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:04,266
So by keeping your workflow as
a modular design it's easier


44
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,756
to find the points where
there are problems,


45
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:12,096
and problems always appear when
you're trying to use a workflow


46
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,006
in an enterprise solution.


47
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:18,016
Look for the places that
are the bottlenecks,


48
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:20,286
and they usually occur
around complexity


49
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:25,346
or a heavy repetition, and you
want to identify those places


50
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,636
and address them so that
your workflows run smooth.


51
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,796
And that's because
in the end all


52
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,166
of our workflows
are run by people.


53
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:41,666
And if your solution is
really complex and intricate,


54
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:45,256
people aren't going to use it
or they won't like using it.


55
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:50,566
But if your workflow is designed
logically so that it flows


56
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:53,446
and it's understandable,
then people are going


57
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:56,066
to love using it and
they'll use it all the time.


58
00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:00,186
So those are the basic workflow
strategies that we're going


59
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:03,186
to look at as I review
some examples


60
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,836
of how you can use
automation in the enterprise,


61
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:09,546
but there's one more concept I'd
like you to pay attention to,


62
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,966
and it is to pursue inclusion.


63
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:18,416
Now what I mean by that
is this: that the success


64
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:25,046
of an organization depends upon
the strategy of and, not or.


65
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:30,936
Many times people get locked
into the idea that's often used


66
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,856
for hardware that one piece of
hardware has to go away in order


67
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:38,516
for another piece of hardware to
take its place, and many times


68
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:42,806
that is true, but when it
comes to providing solutions,


69
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,796
inclusion is really important.


70
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,996
You want to use all of the
tools that are available to you,


71
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:52,586
and we have two platforms
at Apple


72
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,986
that really personify
this power.


73
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:03,586
And they are OS X and iOS, and
they work really well together,


74
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,676
and it is through them working
together that you get success


75
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,126
for your organization.


76
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:13,616
When it comes to
being a good partner,


77
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:17,746
OS X is an incredible
operating system.


78
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:22,436
It is mature, it has a depth of
frameworks that is unrivaled,


79
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:25,426
it has support for all
the different connective


80
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:28,486
technologies that you
want to use in-house


81
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,086
in your organization
to communicate


82
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,086
and share data back and forth.


83
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:38,936
And when it comes to
automation, OS X is unrivaled.


84
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,566
We have AppleScript, the
English-like language


85
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:45,676
that you can use to control the
computer and the applications


86
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:49,306
that run on it, and we've
extended AppleScript


87
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:53,256
with AppleScript/Objective-C,
that gives it a window


88
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:57,106
into the Cocoa framework so
that you can directly talk


89
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,516
to Cocoa classes and call Cocoa
methods from within AppleScript,


90
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,136
so that any of the
Cocoa frameworks


91
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,726
that provide the power
for the OS and all


92
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:09,746
of its apps are available
to your script as well.


93
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:16,206
And last OS, we introduced
JavaScript for Automation


94
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:20,206
so that if you like working with
the JavaScript language or you


95
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:24,536
like a more tight construct,
JavaScript for Automation --


96
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:28,676
or JXA as we call it -- provides
you all of the abilities


97
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:31,366
to control applications
as similar


98
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:35,006
to the way AppleScript does and
it also provides you the window


99
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:37,066
into the Cocoa frameworks,
as well.


100
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:41,516
So if you like using JavaScript,
you can still accomplish all


101
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:44,106
of the kind of automations
you want to do using


102
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:45,766
that as your native language.


103
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,166
And another tool that we
have is Otto the Automator.


104
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:57,026
Automator is a visual tool for
building automation recipes,


105
00:06:57,806 --> 00:06:59,496
through a drag-and-drop process


106
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:02,246
where you take the individual
steps that are required


107
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:05,596
to accomplish something and
you drag them into a file


108
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:07,256
and save them as a workflow.


109
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:11,316
It's incredibly powerful,
it works with any language


110
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:13,896
or ability that's part
of the operating system,


111
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:17,016
and it handles data translation
for you automatically.


112
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,336
We're going to see
this quite a bit today


113
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,046
as we go over some examples.


114
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:25,436
And, finally, because
of its heritage


115
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:30,946
and its power OS X has all of
the UNIX toolset we've come


116
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:34,446
to rely upon, including all of
the different shelves and some


117
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:38,026
of your favorite languages, like
Pearl, Ruby, and Python as well.


118
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,266
So combined, it's a
holistic approach.


119
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,406
This is a very powerful set


120
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:47,046
of automation tools
for you to rely upon.


121
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:53,446
And today we're going to see
how automation can give you the


122
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:56,796
speed, the accuracy,
the consistent output,


123
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,426
and the scalability
that you need


124
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,486
when you're dealing
with solutions.


125
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,496
So let's take a look at
three example scenarios.


126
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:06,966
I'm going to keep them simple


127
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:10,906
so that we can examine the
principle behind them rather


128
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:12,746
than get lost in any complexity.


129
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,746
See, I'm being people-oriented
here.


130
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,026
The first scenario
we're going to look


131
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:21,906
at is how you can create a
workgroup image repository,


132
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,296
and by that I mean we can
have a central computer


133
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:30,536
that is accessible by 40 or 50
people in a local network area


134
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:35,525
by both computers and
wireless devices as well,


135
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:39,936
and how we can use automation
and the technologies of OS X


136
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,405
to make that possible.


137
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:45,976
The second scenario we're
going to look at a basic thing


138
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,266
that faces everyone who
works in an organization,


139
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:52,186
and that's creating
documents on time.


140
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,636
You know, everybody has
challenges of gathering data,


141
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:59,186
and putting it together, and
formatting it, and presenting it


142
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:02,146
in interesting ways,
and so we can look


143
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,666
at how automation can
be used to solve some


144
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,186
of those issues as well.


145
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,386
And, finally, we're
going to look


146
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:10,886
at a third example that's new,


147
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:17,926
where you can use the automation
technologies in OS X to set up


148
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:21,386
and manage iOS devices
automatically.


149
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,586
So this is going to be an
interesting category for us


150
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,006
because it's a new one as well.


151
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:30,156
So let's begin with a workgroup
image repository scenario.


152
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:33,516
Now remember I'm talking
about setting up a computer


153
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,906
that is an image
repository, and we're going


154
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:40,556
to be specifically using
the new photos architecture


155
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:43,736
and frameworks and application
that are part of OS X.


156
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:46,426
And we're going to set
it up on a computer,


157
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:50,356
and this computer is going
to exist in an environment


158
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:55,096
where you have other
laptops and desktop computers


159
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:57,446
that might be running Mac OS X


160
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:01,276
or it could even be running
Windows, as well as being


161
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,646
in an environment that
has mobile devices,


162
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:06,676
whether it's the new MacBook
that we just introduced


163
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:10,726
or it's our great iOS devices,
like iPads and iPhones.


164
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:16,096
And to accomplish this workgroup
concept, we're going to rely


165
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,966
on three OS X technologies.


166
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,096
The first we're going
to use is File Sharing.


167
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:26,736
Now File Sharing is part of
OS X basic core structure,


168
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,946
and it allows you to
set up share points


169
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:34,046
so that other computers
can easily transfer files


170
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:35,476
over to your computer.


171
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:39,046
It's been around forever,
it's based on SMB and AFP,


172
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:43,156
it's very reliable, it's
an established technology.


173
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:47,866
The second technology we're
going to look at is AirDrop,


174
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:52,216
and AirDrop is a
newer technology


175
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,356
that combines Bluetooth
with Wi-Fi


176
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:58,996
so that mobile devices
can easily recognize


177
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:01,916
and transfer files
to a computer.


178
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:05,106
And we're going to use
both of those technologies


179
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:09,256
when we address this task.


180
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,846
Now you'll notice that in
this connective scenario


181
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,616
that we have here, where
we have the computers


182
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:20,526
and the iOS devices, there's one
area that still needs some work


183
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,936
in order for all of this
to become automated.


184
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:28,896
And it is the transferal of the
copied documents or the images


185
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,726
that have been provided
from other sources


186
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:34,586
into the actual media
library itself.


187
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,036
And to solve that
problem we're going


188
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:41,286
to use a technology
called Folder Actions


189
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,566
through Automator.


190
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,056
Now many of you might not
know about Folder Actions,


191
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:50,366
but a Folder Action is a
system service that allows you


192
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:55,696
to assign a workflow to a folder
so that when items are placed


193
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:59,846
into that folder, the system
automatically provides them


194
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:04,176
as input to a workflow that it
executes for you automatically.


195
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,906
And Folder Actions
have been part of OS X


196
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,376
since before it was OS X,
we've had them since System 8.5


197
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:15,816
and they're very powerful, and
we've done a lot of work on it


198
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,936
with the new release
and I think you're going


199
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,436
to really enjoy using them.


200
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:24,466
So let me show you how easy it
is to create a Folder Action.


201
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:28,836
For this we're going to need,
for our scenario we're going


202
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:30,406
to need two different
Folder Actions,


203
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:35,466
one for the Dropbox folder
for the file sharing and one


204
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,786
for the Downloads folder
that is the recipient


205
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:40,616
of the AirDrop files.


206
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,646
And to do that I'm going
to open up Automator,


207
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,576
I'm going to create
a new document,


208
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,616
and from the template I'm
going to choose Folder Action


209
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:51,146
as the type of Automator file.


210
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:56,786
And at the top we're
going to select a folder


211
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:59,846
that is the source
folder for the workflow.


212
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:06,226
So we'll select that,
and I'll navigate


213
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:10,816
over to the Public
folder and then


214
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,136
within the Public
folder we're going


215
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:16,196
to select the Dropbox
folder as the source folder.


216
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,706
So any items placed into
the Dropbox are going


217
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,666
to become the input
for this workflow.


218
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,816
Now we need to perform
some series of actions


219
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:28,576
on those added files,
and to do that I'm going


220
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:33,726
to select the Photos category
over here and I'm going to drag


221
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:38,436
in the Automator action for
importing items into Photos.


222
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:42,166
And I'm running a little
bit of a lag -- there we go.


223
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,916
And so once you've
added an action


224
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,726
to the workflow you
see its action view.


225
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:50,486
The action view contains
all of the controls


226
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:52,876
for the various parameters
for that action.


227
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:56,286
So we're going to set some basic
parameters for that action,


228
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,856
and then it's just a matter
of saving the workflow


229
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:07,346
and giving it a name, like
Import from Dropbox, very good.


230
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:11,776
And once it's been saved
it's automatically installed


231
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,246
into the operating
system and active.


232
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,876
We'll create a second workflow
just like the first one,


233
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,886
the only difference is its
source folder will be the


234
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:21,856
Downloads folder.


235
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:26,166
So that's how easy it is
to create a Folder Action


236
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,696
that can receive files
from network devices.


237
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:33,956
Once that's been done, then
any files that are placed


238
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,666
into these connected
folders will get transferred


239
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,236
automatically into
our image repository.


240
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,976
So let's take a people
perspective


241
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:43,696
and see how this looks


242
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:47,066
to a person using this
from, like, the Mac side.


243
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,906
So if you're running
this from the Mac side,


244
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,886
you have a Finder
window and to connect


245
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:58,146
to the repository shared folder
is just a matter of going


246
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:01,466
to the Finder sidebar
and connecting that,


247
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:06,596
selecting the Public folder
there, and then dragging


248
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:11,926
in whatever images you have
onto the Dropbox itself.


249
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:18,976
The computer is running a
little slow today, there we go,


250
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:20,566
you can see all the builds.


251
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:23,976
And once you do that you'll
get a notification dialogue


252
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:27,186
that tells you you're
about to copy some files


253
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,236
and you won't be able to
see them -- is that okay?


254
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:31,146
You approve that
and the files --


255
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,296
the two computers are
automatically connected,


256
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:37,596
and the file gets transferred
over into the other folder.


257
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,476
The Automator workflow
gets executed,


258
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:45,246
and the copied image gets
added to our image repository.


259
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,126
So this is how it looks
when you're running this


260
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:50,806
from the OS X side of
things through file sharing.


261
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,206
Now let's examine the same
process, but this time


262
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:57,046
from the viewpoint of
using a mobile device.


263
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:02,856
So with your mobile device you
connect it, you turn it on,


264
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:05,426
you find the image that you
want from your mobile device,


265
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:08,636
you click, you tap
the Share button.


266
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:17,456
You wait for the destination
to become visible as a network,


267
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:21,356
as an AirDrop target,
you select the AirDrop


268
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,636
and then the connection is made
and the image is transferred


269
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:28,406
over to the computer, and then
the Folder Action is triggered


270
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:30,356
and the image is copied into it.


271
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:34,386
So from a person's
perspective you can see


272
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:38,116
that this becomes a very
easy-to-use operation.


273
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:43,356
This strategy incorporates
basic technologies that are part


274
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:46,886
of OS X and File Sharing
and AirDrop as well


275
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:50,646
as Folder Actions, and it works
with a variety of devices,


276
00:16:50,806 --> 00:16:55,386
including computers, Mac
computers, Windows computers,


277
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:57,146
and mobile devices as well.


278
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:00,436
Now I know you're asking,
well, okay, Sal, wait a second,


279
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:04,915
so when I send an AirDrop
over, there's a notification


280
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,846
that happens, what
happens if there's nobody


281
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:10,256
at the computer,
what do you do then?


282
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,896
Well, here's another case


283
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,636
where automation can
solve a problem for you.


284
00:17:14,996 --> 00:17:19,306
You can use the Auto
Accept AppleScript droplet


285
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,786
that whenever a notification
is set,


286
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:25,636
it will automatically accept
it and continue the process


287
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,586
of allowing the image
to be transferred


288
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:29,986
over to the media library.


289
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:34,916
All of this is available, you
can download the beta version


290
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,936
of the photos actions
that you saw here


291
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,416
and you can follow the
instructions on this


292
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,536
and as well get the
Auto Accept droplet


293
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:46,466
from this location,
photosautomation.com.


294
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,226
Okay, so that's our
first scenario


295
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:55,456
of using automation technologies
in a mixed-use environment


296
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:58,886
to be able to solve
some problems.


297
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,846
The next scenario
we're going to look


298
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,606
at is how we can automate
document construction.


299
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:07,906
Now the thing about using
the automation technologies


300
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:14,366
in OS X is that they're very
powerful and they act as you,


301
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,686
they act on your behalf
with all the authority


302
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,426
that you have as a user.


303
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:23,966
So you can do all the things


304
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:26,466
that you normally do
through automation.


305
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:30,476
You can command and control
applications, you can copy data


306
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:34,356
from one place to another, you
can create and delete files,


307
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,046
you can mount volumes,
you can unmounts volumes,


308
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:40,366
pretty much anything that
you can do as a user,


309
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,326
automation can do
on your behalf.


310
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:47,246
And this is incredibly powerful
because when you combine


311
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:50,516
that with the fact that we
have some great scriptable


312
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:55,026
applications on OS X, then you
can really accomplish a lot


313
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,266
and create very inventive,
useful solutions.


314
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,716
So here's a simple example.


315
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:04,656
Let's say as part of
your daily or as part


316
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:07,206
of your job assignment,
I'll put it that way,


317
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,696
every Thursday you
have to gather the data


318
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,526
about your company's
sales, you have to put it


319
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,126
into a presentation
that you deliver


320
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:20,626
to your teammates
every Thursday.


321
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,906
And this usually takes quite a
while to do because you've got


322
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:27,056
to go gather the data, then
you have to transform it


323
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:31,546
from one shape of being
spreadsheet into being a chart,


324
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,616
then you have to build
the presentation.


325
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:37,356
So here's an example of
how you can use automation


326
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,286
to automate that process.


327
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:44,076
Using Automator, you can
create a workflow for yourself


328
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:47,786
that will automatically build
a presentation that grabs data


329
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,946
out of other files, transforms
it into the things you need,


330
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:55,446
and then triggers the sending
of it to your iOS device,


331
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:59,416
so that all you have to do
is just accept the transfer


332
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,676
from the computer and then


333
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:07,136
within a couple seconds you have
the presentation ready to go


334
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:10,376
that you can take
with you when you have


335
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,466
to do your presentation
with your team.


336
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:16,396
So this is a simple
example of the power


337
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,256
of creating a document.


338
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,916
So let me show you that, I'm
going to create a workflow


339
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,926
that does just what we just saw.


340
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:30,296
And this is my desktop
that is the Martian sunset,


341
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:34,156
NASA just released this photo,
it's totally incredible,


342
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,666
it just really makes
you feel small


343
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,046
in the universe when
I look at that.


344
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,396
Okay, so I'm going
to create a workflow


345
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:45,036
that generates a presentation
and incorporates data


346
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:50,636
from a spreadsheet and then
sends it to my mobile device


347
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:52,876
that I have over
here via AirDrop.


348
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:57,006
So I'm going to launch
Automator, and I'm going


349
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:01,086
to create a new document,
and let me just zoom this


350
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:02,656
so that we can see together.


351
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,516
How is that?


352
00:21:03,556 --> 00:21:04,496
Much better isn't it?


353
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:06,406
So when you launch Automator,


354
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:09,106
you'll see that there's
a template picker here.


355
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,126
For our purposes we're just
going to use a workflow


356
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:15,026
that I save into this
system-wide script menu


357
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:17,296
so that it's always
available for me.


358
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:18,876
So I'll click Choose.


359
00:21:19,616 --> 00:21:22,516
Over on the left-hand
side is the library


360
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:26,046
of Automator actions, those
are those individual nuggets


361
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:28,516
of functionality that
you combine together


362
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:30,556
to make an automation recipe.


363
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:34,086
And you can view them by
category, as it shows here,


364
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,026
or you can even arrange
them by application.


365
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,446
I'm going to choose
application and then go


366
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:42,896
to the Keynote application
and click on that.


367
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:45,776
When I click on it, you can
see all the actions related


368
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:47,726
to Keynote are available
over here


369
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,506
and whatever action I have
selected has a description


370
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,956
that appears here at the bottom


371
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:55,176
that gives me information
on how to use it.


372
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,966
So let me create a workflow.


373
00:21:56,966 --> 00:22:00,066
The first thing I'm going
to do is add an action


374
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:02,566
to the workflow area
by dragging in here


375
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:04,666
for creating a new presentation.


376
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:08,146
You can see that the action
view has various controls


377
00:22:08,146 --> 00:22:10,276
and parameters for
deciding what kind


378
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:12,146
of presentation I
want to create.


379
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:13,996
I'm going to choose a gradient.


380
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:16,656
I'm going to choose its
dimensions to be set


381
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:21,866
for a mobile device, and I'll
just basically leave it at that.


382
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:26,046
So my first action is to
create the presentation.


383
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:29,616
Now when you create a default
presentation in Keynote,


384
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:33,206
it gives you one slide
that is title and subtitle.


385
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:37,306
So the next step I want to
do is to set the contents


386
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:38,856
of the title and subtitle.


387
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:43,426
To do that I'm going to use
an action called Set Contents


388
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,836
of Default Text Items.


389
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,066
I drag it in.


390
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,466
You notice that there's
a connection made


391
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:52,266
so that a reference to the
new presentation is passed


392
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:53,116
to this action.


393
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,176
It then knows which
presentation to work with.


394
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:58,416
I'm going to set it
so that the title


395
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:03,686
of the presentation will
be Sales Report, like this.


396
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:07,476
And then for the subtitle
I want the current date.


397
00:23:08,116 --> 00:23:11,506
And since I want this to be a
workflow that I can use over


398
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,826
and over again, I'm going
to use an Automator variable


399
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,506
to dynamically generate
the date for me.


400
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:21,496
Over here on the library I'll
click the Variables category,


401
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:26,026
and variables are containers
of data, they can either be


402
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:29,046
from storing it or
dynamically generated.


403
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,896
So I'll click Date
and Time and then drag


404
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:36,246
in today's date variable into
the body field over here.


405
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:40,716
Now you'll notice that it
automatically gets added


406
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,846
into a list of variables
currently used


407
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:44,356
by the document at the bottom.


408
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:48,256
I can set the parameters for how
the variable is going to appear


409
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:51,796
by clicking Edit and then
choosing a format that I'd like,


410
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:56,066
like this one where I have full
month, date, and then the year.


411
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:02,876
So my second slide, my second
task, the second action has been


412
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:07,846
to name the presentation
and provide a subtitle.


413
00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:12,336
The next step is to apply a
transition for that slide.


414
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:17,516
So I'll go back to my actions
and I'll go drag in the action


415
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:18,926
for setting transition.


416
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:23,196
From that I'm going to choose
-- let's do a basic dissolve.


417
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,626
I'll set it for about a
second and a half on click.


418
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:28,686
All right, now that
we've done that,


419
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:31,036
I'll need to create a
new slide that I'm going


420
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,586
to add my sales data to.


421
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:37,526
And for this slide, I'm going
to create one that has a title


422
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:41,016
at the top and I'm going to add
it to the end of the slides.


423
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:44,946
So I have a new presentation,
I've titled it, subtitled it,


424
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,756
created a transition for the
first slide, added a new slide.


425
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,486
Now I'm ready to add the
data that I want to have


426
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:58,106
in my presentation, but this
data lives in another file.


427
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:02,936
I have a numbers spreadsheet
here that contains the data


428
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,436
that I want to bring
into my presentation.


429
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:08,436
So I'm going to close that


430
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:11,386
and use an action
here called Add Chart


431
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:15,606
with Numbers Table Data,
drag it into my workflow,


432
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:19,576
and you can see that the action
view has two areas for settings,


433
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,396
the Data Settings and
the Chart Settings.


434
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,936
So we're going to pick the
file that I want to use,


435
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:29,526
it will be in my Documents
folder, and here it is,


436
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:33,796
ACME Widget Domestic Sales --
bring that over a little bit,


437
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:36,866
like that -- and then I
can choose to identify


438
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,716
which table in that document.


439
00:25:38,716 --> 00:25:42,096
I can use the active table, a
selection of the active table,


440
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,656
I can use the first table
that's on the active sheet,


441
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:49,376
or I can even enter a name
for the table and it will find


442
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:50,726
that table in the document.


443
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,206
I'm going to use first
table of active sheet,


444
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:56,876
and I want to use the table
title for the slide title.


445
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:58,886
Now when it comes to a chart,


446
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:01,706
I'm going to pick something
very standard like a 2D,


447
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,536
I'm going to group it by
column data like this.


448
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:08,286
So now I've created a
presentation, I've titled it,


449
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:11,346
subtitled it, applied a
transition, added a new slide,


450
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:15,296
imported data from a file,
formatted into a chart,


451
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:17,006
added that chart to a slide.


452
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:23,086
The next step is I will save
this document using a Save


453
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,636
Document action, I'm going
to save it to a folder,


454
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,506
and I'm going to save it
to my Documents folder.


455
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:31,506
And for its name I'm going
to call it Sales Report,


456
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:35,926
and then I want the file
name to have the same name


457
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:39,246
as the variable, so I'll
drag the variable from here


458
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:43,756
up into this field, so now the
file will be named Sales Report


459
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:49,396
and the current date.key and
replace any existing file.


460
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:56,196
And then, finally, I have over
here my little iPad ready to go,


461
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,176
and I have it set up with
AirDrop, so let's make it easy


462
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,716
to get that file over here.


463
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:08,646
I'm going to go begin AirDrop
with disk items, and I'll extend


464
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:11,736
out the AirDrop for a
couple seconds extra just


465
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,376
in case we need it.


466
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:15,856
And what this will do is
at the end of the workflow,


467
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:17,416
it will take the
file that's created


468
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:20,446
and automatically begin an
AirDrop so that I can see it


469
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:22,656
over on my iPad and
receive it there.


470
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,786
So I would save this,
I would place this


471
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:31,116
into the Scripts folder,
I would find a location


472
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,166
that I like to keep it.


473
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:35,416
And then once it's saved, it
becomes part of your script


474
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,206
and you can choose
it at any time.


475
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:42,426
I'll run the workflow so that
you can see it run in action,


476
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:46,416
right from here, let me
zoom back out a little bit.


477
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:52,566
And I will run this workflow, it
will generate the sales report,


478
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,856
grab the data, bring it in,
and begin the AirDrop session,


479
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:02,736
and there's the Woodbury School,
so now I'll click over to three.


480
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:07,936
You can see, yes, you can see
here I'm going to accept this,


481
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,296
and it's going to copy
it right into Keynote.


482
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:16,166
I can bring it in, I can do
editing because the power


483
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,926
of iWork I can make it a
little bit more colorful.


484
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:21,886
And then I actually have
my presentation here


485
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:26,486
and I can begin delivering --
it's going to give me some tips,


486
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:30,226
and get to the next
presentation.


487
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:38,096
So there's an example of how you
can create a workflow using the


488
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:42,736
power of OS X -- let's
go back to one --


489
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:47,256
so here's how you can create
a workflow using the power


490
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:51,806
of the automation technologies
in OS X to make the process


491
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:56,546
of creating a chart and
a presentation as simple


492
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:59,936
as just going to a menu and
selecting that option for you.


493
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,896
Okay, so let's go
back to slides here.


494
00:29:03,486 --> 00:29:05,106
[Applause] Oh, thank you.


495
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:11,686
So how do we get
back over there?


496
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,426
You guys do that, magic.


497
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:15,736
Isn't it interesting?


498
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:17,396
I'll bet you most of
you didn't realize


499
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:19,446
that stuff was actually
in the OS, huh?


500
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:25,586
Right? Okay, so this
example uses all


501
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:29,576
of our automation technologies
that you have available to you.


502
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:32,666
And remember, they act
on your behalf with all


503
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:36,856
of your authority, so you're
not limited by what you can do.


504
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:39,856
You don't need a specific
app for each step of it,


505
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:41,806
all you need is the
functionality


506
00:29:41,806 --> 00:29:44,666
that can be exposed to
you through Automator.


507
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,926
And you have some great apps
to work with, like iWork


508
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:50,406
and Photos, the Finder
and FileMaker Pro,


509
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,676
you can create incredible
solutions.


510
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:57,406
And this example with
the Automator actions


511
00:29:57,476 --> 00:30:00,566
and the whole complete
examples available for you today


512
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,976
at iworkautomation.com.


513
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:05,726
It's a website that
contains individual websites


514
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:08,766
about pages, numbers,
and Keynote.


515
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:12,096
I think you'll find it
useful in an informative way.


516
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:16,436
Okay, so that's Automating
Document Construction.


517
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,036
And for our last example we're
going to try something new,


518
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:22,356
this will be the first
time I'm demoing this,


519
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,616
it's the first time
anybody has seen this,


520
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:26,806
and you guys are the ones
that are going to see it.


521
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:30,446
We're going to talk about
setting up iOS devices.


522
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:33,296
Now there could be no doubt


523
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:37,386
that Apple makes the
most incredibly powerful


524
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:41,906
and sophisticated and elegant
mobile devices there are.


525
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:46,386
They are wonderful tools for the
enterprise, they're attractive,


526
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,926
they're powerful,
they're easy to use.


527
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,076
And with our partnership now


528
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:57,906
with IBM we are creating
best-of-class applications


529
00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:02,266
for data deployment to put the
power of the enterprise right


530
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:05,786
at your staff's hands
and fingers.


531
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:09,366
And it's really incredible
what the tools


532
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,276
that are being produced
through this collaboration.


533
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:19,446
And we really are happy with
what is being developed,


534
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:22,986
but let's talk about for a
second, not data deployment,


535
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,886
but device deployment.


536
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,646
So when it comes to
device deployment,


537
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:30,206
there's usually two
strategies that you follow.


538
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:32,846
The first is called One to One,


539
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:36,706
and in One to One you
have a group of employees


540
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,106
that are given a mobile device


541
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:42,676
that is profiled
specifically for them.


542
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:46,946
It contains information about
them, it is targeted to them,


543
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:50,426
so that no matter where they
move within your organization


544
00:31:50,686 --> 00:31:57,096
or within geographic location
that device stays with them.


545
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,886
Now the second strategy


546
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:03,436
for device deployment
is called Shared Use,


547
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:06,906
and in this scenario you
have a set of devices


548
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:10,436
that are configured
generically for your company


549
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:15,056
as the identifier, and then your
staff uses those as they need


550
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:18,626
and then passes them to
other members of your staff


551
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:21,846
who will use them and then
pass them to other members


552
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:24,546
of your staff that gets
to use them as well.


553
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:29,026
So shared use, you have a
limited number of mobile devices


554
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,856
that get used by a
large variety of people,


555
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:36,166
as compared to a
one-to-one scenario


556
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:39,426
where every employee gets
their own mobile device.


557
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:42,706
Now in shared use,
a couple scenarios


558
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:45,446
that quite often
happen with shared use,


559
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:50,116
are you'll see them used in
professional organizations,


560
00:32:50,606 --> 00:32:53,796
you'll see them used in
service organizations,


561
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:58,796
and you'll also see them
used in classrooms as well.


562
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:04,196
Many classrooms use a limited
number of mobile devices


563
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:07,426
that they format and set
up for different classes


564
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:09,096
and different use
throughout the school.


565
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,586
So with both Shared
Use and One to One,


566
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:16,796
Apple has some great solutions
for device management.


567
00:33:16,796 --> 00:33:20,226
For One to One, we have our
device enrollment program


568
00:33:20,526 --> 00:33:22,666
and we have the volume
purchase program.


569
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:26,286
That really makes just
a simple setup process:


570
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:29,436
you turn on the device
and connects to a network,


571
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:32,606
it will set itself up for
that employee automatically.


572
00:33:33,526 --> 00:33:36,636
When it comes to Shared
Use we have an application,


573
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,086
it's called Apple Configurator.


574
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,816
And Apple Configurator is
the application that you use


575
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:47,956
to connect to hardware
controllers like this


576
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:54,626
or like carts like this so that
you can have it manage hundreds


577
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:57,786
or dozens of devices
simultaneously.


578
00:33:58,366 --> 00:34:01,426
You connect your computer
to the hardware controller


579
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:05,666
and then you run the software
to manage that device.


580
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:10,476
On Tuesday we announced a
brand-new reimagined version


581
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:14,025
of Apple Configurator
with the incredible name


582
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:16,156
of Apple Configurator 2.


583
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:22,496
And this look and feel of this
application is very interesting.


584
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:27,485
It now has a very nice graphical
flow to it, it's a lot easier


585
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:32,896
to use, and imagine the
controls, they're visual,


586
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:37,406
and they've done a really good
job at taking the complexity


587
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:43,196
of the processes for setting up
devices and made them logical


588
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:46,815
and attractive in
appearance to use.


589
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:52,946
Now even this application, as
smooth as it is, still requires


590
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:55,856
that you have some basic
knowledge of terminology


591
00:34:56,315 --> 00:35:00,096
and the intricacies of
managing mobile devices.


592
00:35:00,486 --> 00:35:04,166
This requires you to understand
these various concepts,


593
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:08,056
and for you guys that's
not really an issue


594
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:12,736
because you're all
award-winning IT professionals,


595
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:16,646
you have your crack staffs
and for you complexity, ah,


596
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:19,016
it's no big deal, you can drop


597
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,176
into the command line
anytime you need.


598
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,906
But it just so happens that in
large organizations it's quite


599
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:29,396
often a reality that
the people who end


600
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:34,456
up managing devices really
don't have a great depth


601
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:37,126
of knowledge about IT issues.


602
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:42,196
So we call them, like,
accidental administrators.


603
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:47,446
It might be someone who
assumes a role or assumes a task


604
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:50,336
because another person has
moved to a different part


605
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:54,076
in the company, or organizations
might merge together


606
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:57,026
and people assume
new responsibilities.


607
00:35:57,436 --> 00:36:01,996
So your challenge as an IT
professional is to create tools


608
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:05,326
that will solve these people's
problems and allow them


609
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:06,966
to set up mobile devices.


610
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:11,706
And, fortunately, new
Apple Configurator 2 comes


611
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,326
with Automator support.


612
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:20,196
And you as the IT professional
can use that Automator support


613
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:25,436
to easily create Automator
workflows that will go


614
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:31,796
through the various steps to set
up and configure mobile devices


615
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:36,066
and do the various actions
and the complexities


616
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:40,976
and the authentications and all
of the other interesting things


617
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:44,706
that have to be done in
order to set up a device.


618
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:49,306
And these actions will
run in order from the top


619
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:51,686
of your workflow down to
the bottom of your workflow,


620
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:55,806
they're executed, passing
along data as they work.


621
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:59,216
And then it's just a
matter of you being able


622
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:04,496
to save this workflow to the
Script folder on your computer,


623
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,136
and then it will
become installed


624
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:09,606
and ready to use by others.


625
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,246
So when the workflow
gets installed


626
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:14,976
into the Scripts folder, it
becomes part of the Script menu,


627
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,766
so that anybody that's using


628
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:21,156
that management computer just
merely needs to connect devices,


629
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:26,896
go to the Script menu, and then
choose one of the setup scripts


630
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,786
that you have created
through Automator,


631
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:34,086
one of the setup workflows,
and then let the process begin


632
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:40,116
and manage the device, either
setting it up or configuring it,


633
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:41,446
and everybody is happy.


634
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:46,126
So let's take a look
at a specific scenario.


635
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:48,956
I'm going to create a
workflow and set up a device


636
00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:52,926
for you here, and in
this scenario we're going


637
00:37:52,926 --> 00:37:56,476
to have a -- we're going to
create an Automator workflow


638
00:37:56,676 --> 00:38:01,496
that will automatically install
required documents onto iPads.


639
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:04,266
So in this scenario let's
say we have a school


640
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,626
that we're working with,
we're going to want to copy


641
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:09,876
across the book report
template, the student handbook,


642
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:14,976
the student presentation
template, those kind of things.


643
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:16,766
So we're going to
create a workflow


644
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:18,956
that will allow administrators


645
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:22,516
to easily transfer
documents over to iPads.


646
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:27,446
So let's take a look
at that now.


647
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:33,386
There we go, let's launch
Automator, and I'm going to zoom


648
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:36,116
into this so you can see a
little bit better as we do this.


649
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:39,936
Again, I could choose
to create a variety


650
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:43,616
of Automator workflow
types, like workflow,


651
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:46,826
a self-running application, a
system service, a print plug-in,


652
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:50,046
a folder action, calendar,
alarm, image capture plug-in,


653
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:53,196
or a dictation command, but for
our purposes we're just going


654
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,146
to use a standard workflow file


655
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:57,966
that we can have installed
into the Script menu.


656
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,216
Over on the left-hand side,


657
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:03,746
I'm going to choose Apple
Configurator as the category


658
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:06,866
that I'm going to be
drawing my actions from,


659
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:08,726
and then it's just a matter


660
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:12,426
of putting together
the various steps.


661
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:14,646
So the first thing you do
when you create a workflow


662
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,056
that involves setting up
mobile devices is to identify


663
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,086
which devices you
want to work with.


664
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:22,536
So we have two actions
for doing that,


665
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:24,436
you have Choose Connected
Devices,


666
00:39:24,436 --> 00:39:27,216
which would interactively
present you a list,


667
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:31,056
or we're going to use the one
called Get Connected Devices.


668
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:34,286
I'll drag it into my
workflow area, and you can see


669
00:39:34,286 --> 00:39:37,956
that in the action view I
can choose iPads, iPhones,


670
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:42,656
iPod touches, or Apple TVs,
so I can have multiple types


671
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,646
of devices connected and filter


672
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:46,496
out the ones that
I'm looking for.


673
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:48,066
We're going to choose iPad.


674
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:52,656
Then once I've identified the
devices this action will pass a


675
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,616
reference to those devices to
the next action, which is going


676
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:58,916
to be to copy some
documents over.


677
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,486
So I have an action here
called Copy Documents


678
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:04,636
to Devices, I drag that in.


679
00:40:05,546 --> 00:40:10,706
In iOS a document is
associated with a specific app,


680
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:15,466
so you have to identify
what application is going


681
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:17,546
to be associated
with these documents.


682
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:20,936
And there's two ways to do that,
you can pick it from the list


683
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:24,406
of installed applications on
this computer or you can enter


684
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:26,496
in the iOS app ID, here.


685
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:29,446
We're going to choose
pick from the list.


686
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:32,366
I'm going to choose the first
one, Adobe Acrobat Reader,


687
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:39,036
and then I'm going to click
this to locate the documents.


688
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:40,576
In this case I want PDFs,


689
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:43,696
I'm going to choose the student
handbook, yes, and I'm going


690
00:40:43,696 --> 00:40:45,806
to choose the student
newsletter, okay, good.


691
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:47,826
So I'll select these two,


692
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:52,376
and these two have now been
associated with this application


693
00:40:52,506 --> 00:40:55,136
and will copy across
to the device.


694
00:40:55,456 --> 00:40:58,136
Now here's a tip, as
administrator you might want


695
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,656
to go back into this
workflow again sometime,


696
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:05,566
hold down the right key, the
Control key, right-click this


697
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:09,406
and go rename, and you can add
a comment into the action title.


698
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:14,996
So I'm going to say
Install Student Handbook,


699
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,936
and then hit the
-- oh, handbook --


700
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:23,426
nothing is going to help me
with my spelling, handbook.


701
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,066
And now I can collapse that.


702
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,826
So I have Get Connected Devices,
Install Student Handbook.


703
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,886
Let's add this action again.


704
00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:35,026
This time I'm going to
choose as an application,


705
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,016
I'm going to choose
the Pages application.


706
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:40,226
I'll go back here, select
it again, and I'm going


707
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:42,696
to choose the book
report template,


708
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:46,906
and I'll right-click
the title bar


709
00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:52,756
and go Install Book
Report, very good.


710
00:41:52,756 --> 00:41:57,856
And then I'm going to add the
action one more time over here,


711
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:01,826
and I'm going to choose Keynote
as the associated application,


712
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:04,876
choose Add, and then we're going


713
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:09,206
to find the photo slideshow
template, choose that,


714
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:12,806
right-click the title bar
so I can give myself a name.


715
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:18,856
I go Install Photo
Slideshow, very good.


716
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,946
So there's my simple workflow,


717
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:23,086
so if those documents
are required


718
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:27,166
in all my devices now I have
a workflow that can be run


719
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,336
by my accidental administrators


720
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:33,516
to automatically copy all
the required documents over.


721
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:36,996
I can come back to this
workflow later and update it


722
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:38,926
with new documents if I want to.


723
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:40,526
One more thing.


724
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:44,956
I often find it useful that
when you're creating workflows


725
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:48,686
for others that you give
them a confirmation dialogue


726
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:51,816
at the beginning and end
of the workflow process.


727
00:42:52,276 --> 00:42:55,526
So I have a script here
that does that for me,


728
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:58,006
that adds in confirmation
actions,


729
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:00,546
so when the workflow is
run you'll get this kind


730
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:02,666
of confirmation action here.


731
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:06,326
Now I have my iPad
connected over here,


732
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:08,576
I'm going to copy this across.


733
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:11,386
Let's see if the
network holds up today.


734
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:14,076
We're going to actually run
this workflow right now.


735
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:19,466
So here's my confirmation,
and it's beginning the process


736
00:43:19,616 --> 00:43:21,436
of identifying the devices.


737
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:27,876
It's now copying across
the first set of handbooks,


738
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:32,216
and now it's copying
across the book report,


739
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:35,796
and now it's copying
across the Keynote document,


740
00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:39,276
and now it's confirmed
to me that it is done.


741
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:44,986
So let's go over to number
three, number three is showing


742
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:46,446
up over here -- yes, okay,


743
00:43:46,446 --> 00:43:49,106
so here's our Woodbury
Middle School pad,


744
00:43:49,356 --> 00:43:53,156
if I go to the Acrobat
Reader you can see that, hey,


745
00:43:53,156 --> 00:43:55,946
there's the student
handbook, indeed,


746
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:58,286
and here's the student
newsletter


747
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:00,876
that they can read, very good.


748
00:44:01,336 --> 00:44:05,806
And if I go to Pages,
I can import


749
00:44:05,806 --> 00:44:11,516
that new book report template
into here, I'll tap it, hey,


750
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,946
and there's a place you can
add your picture as a student.


751
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:17,436
I'm going to choose take
photo, reverse the camera,


752
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:24,316
hold it on myself, use the
photo, it gets transferred in,


753
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:26,406
crazy man making a book report.


754
00:44:27,256 --> 00:44:29,856
And then, finally, I'm
going to go to Keynote here


755
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:35,096
and you can see, I'll click Add,
and here is our photo slideshow


756
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:38,636
for students using the official
Woodbury School template,


757
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,346
so I launch that.


758
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:44,296
And then I can add a
slide from the template,


759
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:48,746
and as long as we're doing that
let's add in a picture here,


760
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:54,986
let's pick this one, double tap,
call that Wind Power like that,


761
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:57,536
give that a capital, Power.


762
00:44:58,836 --> 00:45:00,096
Spell, Sal, spell.


763
00:45:01,236 --> 00:45:01,776
Very good.


764
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:04,116
So there's the template.


765
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:11,256
So anytime that our accidental
administrators need to use


766
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:14,526
or configure some devices,
they just connect it,


767
00:45:14,526 --> 00:45:16,666
they go over to the Script menu,


768
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:20,146
and they go over to the
Script menu on the computer,


769
00:45:20,406 --> 00:45:22,966
choose Woodbury School,
and they can pick from any


770
00:45:22,966 --> 00:45:25,076
of the various things
that they have set up.


771
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:27,936
Now I want to show
you one other thing.


772
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:31,456
I'm going to choose this Rename
and Wallpaper workflow and open


773
00:45:31,456 --> 00:45:33,926
that up over here for us
to examine a little bit.


774
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:38,996
One of the things about any
workflow is customization.


775
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,316
You might not find all the
actions that you're looking


776
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:49,696
for within a particular library
of actions, but the advantage is


777
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:52,066
that since you're
using a variety


778
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:58,176
of automation technologies, you
can use the AppleScript library


779
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:02,816
that the Apple Configurator,
Automator actions are based upon


780
00:46:03,056 --> 00:46:05,756
to create your own
customized scripts


781
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:08,406
that you can insert
into the workflow.


782
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:13,956
This particular script here will
name the device a default name,


783
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:17,936
like Woodbury School, and then
add, append its serial number


784
00:46:17,936 --> 00:46:21,016
to it as well, or any other
information that you want.


785
00:46:21,206 --> 00:46:23,376
So this is what the
script for that type


786
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:25,156
of thing would actually look at.


787
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:28,156
Okay, let's go back
to our slides.


788
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:37,026
So when you use Automator
to set up iOS devices,


789
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:39,456
you can create these
kind of workflows


790
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:41,836
that could be used
by anybody, even you.


791
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:45,246
They're convenient,
easily modifiable


792
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:49,376
because they're modular,
and they're used by anybody,


793
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,496
even your accidental
administrators.


794
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:54,016
And you can also then call


795
00:46:54,016 --> 00:46:56,996
into the underlying library
structure using either


796
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:58,876
JavaScript or AppleScript


797
00:46:58,876 --> 00:47:02,246
to make your own detailed
controllers as well.


798
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:06,516
And that, all of this,
is documented for you


799
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:10,576
at a third website, called
configautomation.com.


800
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:12,876
It's available for you today.


801
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:18,236
So we looked at three different
examples today of how automation


802
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:22,246
and OS X can be used to
support the enterprise.


803
00:47:22,536 --> 00:47:26,256
And especially important to
remember that the concept


804
00:47:26,256 --> 00:47:28,876
of inclusion is really valuable.


805
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:32,806
When you have iOS and
OS X working together,


806
00:47:33,256 --> 00:47:34,566
they're unbeatable.


807
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:39,216
When you have a variety of
work tools available to you,


808
00:47:39,406 --> 00:47:42,266
you can create interesting
and powerful solutions.


809
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:46,776
And remember we have these links
here for you to get information


810
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:49,426
about all of the examples
that I showed you today.


811
00:47:49,586 --> 00:47:53,546
We have photosautomation.com,
configautomation.com,


812
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,626
iworkautomation.com,
and for OS X


813
00:47:56,626 --> 00:48:00,336
in general we have
macosxautomation.com as well.


814
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:05,316
So I want to remind you that
if you want more detailed


815
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:08,076
information about
Apple Configurator 2,


816
00:48:08,326 --> 00:48:12,256
Todd on Tuesday really
covered it well in his session,


817
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:14,916
and I urge you to go back
and look at the video


818
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,896
on that, on his session.


819
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:20,076
In addition, we have some
labs that are going on today


820
00:48:20,076 --> 00:48:23,526
and tomorrow, and after I'm done
here I'm going to go downstairs


821
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,336
and hang out at the lab so
you can come by and see me


822
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,976
and ask any questions
about this and we can play


823
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,796
