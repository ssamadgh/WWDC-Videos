00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:35,806
>> Hi. My name is
Lauren Strehlow,


4
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:39,026
and I'm User Experience
Evangelist at Apple.


5
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:43,386
I work directly with developers
to improve the user experience


6
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:45,216
of their apps on Apple TV.


7
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:49,436
And I'm here today to talk to
you about Designing for tvOS.


8
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,786
This is a really exciting time


9
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:57,066
because this is the
Apple TV's first WWDC.


10
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,686
Yeah. Right.


11
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:02,546
[ Applause ]


12
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,376
And your Apple TV apps
have already started


13
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:07,736
to change the way
we think of TV.


14
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:12,106
And Apple TV App Store
is only 9 months old.


15
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:16,356
And this newness provides
an incredible opportunity


16
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:18,386
for your apps.


17
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,576
So, today we will
talk about tvOS,


18
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:25,996
because this is a unique
platform that has its own set


19
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,296
of design considerations.


20
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:29,996
But, before we dive
into all of that,


21
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:34,816
we need to first take a
step back and talk about TV.


22
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,806
This is TV.


23
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:41,646
And we love TV.


24
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:46,086
We love TV because it's
a way to be entertained.


25
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:51,766
It's a way to learn, to
play, and to connect.


26
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:52,956
TV's are powerful.


27
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,436
And the TV is something that
multiple people can experience


28
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:59,746
at the same time, which
makes the experience


29
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:04,356
at Apple TV unique from the rest
of our devices, because most


30
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,926
of our devices are close.


31
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:08,506
Their personal because
they're in our hands


32
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,526
and we interact with
them directly.


33
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:15,086
But, the TV is not in
your hands, a remote is.


34
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:17,906
And that screen is
far away from you.


35
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:21,816
So, if you want to make
an awesome Apple TV app,


36
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,386
you must first acknowledge
that distance


37
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,406
between you and the screen.


38
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:30,426
And you have to understand
that when you interact


39
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,836
with that screen that's far
away from you it's indirect,


40
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,836
because of that distance.


41
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,886
So, this makes the
Apple TV different


42
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:39,456
from the rest of our devices.


43
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:43,196
So, you have to design
differently for the TV.


44
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:48,976
So, today talking about
designing for tvOS,


45
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,166
we will first go
over some basics.


46
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,336
And that way we will
all be on the same page.


47
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:56,236
And then we'll jump into
the fundamental differences


48
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:56,996
of the TV.


49
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,746
And how to design
your app for distance.


50
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:02,636
And how to design your app
to work well with the remote.


51
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:07,006
We're going to touch on some
great new features in tvOS,


52
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,556
and those will be the ones
that impact your designs.


53
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,496
And I also want to
share a few apps


54
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:15,406
that have designed
differently for the Apple TV.


55
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:19,176
So, let's go ahead and
start with some basics.


56
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:25,906
If you're coming over from
iOS, note that on Apple TV,


57
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,156
app layouts don't
automatically adjust


58
00:03:28,296 --> 00:03:29,526
to the size of the screen.


59
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,136
Your interface is going to
be the same size regardless


60
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:34,756
of the TV screen size.


61
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:39,436
So, you need to design with
a screen resolution of 1920


62
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:45,056
by 1080 pixels, which implies a
16:9 wide screen aspect ratio.


63
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:49,546
And all of your assets
will be at a 1x resolution.


64
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,446
And there's something
else to keep in mind,


65
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,096
over scanning can
occur on older TV's.


66
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,786
And this could cause
unintentional cropping.


67
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,856
So, keep your apps
main content away


68
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:02,076
from the edges of the screen.


69
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:06,596
And a good guide is to avoid 60
pixels from the top and bottom,


70
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,696
and 90 pixels from each side.


71
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,316
So, that's it.


72
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:13,346
Those are the basics.


73
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:17,196
So, now we can talk about
the first key factor


74
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:20,875
that makes the TV unique and
how it impacts your designs.


75
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:24,026
And that is our distance
from the screen.


76
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:30,356
So, on average we are 10
feet away from the TV screen.


77
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,496
And that's significant,
because you need to be aware


78
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:36,746
of that distance when you're
considering your apps layout.


79
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:41,236
So, keep in mind that
larger items are much easier


80
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,336
to see from far away.


81
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:46,216
Everything in your user
interface should be larger.


82
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:48,946
And that's starting
with graphics.


83
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,626
Both graphics and your user
interface elements such as,


84
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,286
buttons or controls
need to be larger


85
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,426
so they can be easily
seen from across the room.


86
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:01,426
Now, I know it may
feel unnatural


87
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:03,406
if you're used to
designing for iOS.


88
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,606
But, on Apple TV you want
to make sure that nobody has


89
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:09,516
to struggle to see
what's on screen.


90
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:13,796
So, larger items are simply
easier to see from a distance.


91
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:19,166
In addition to increasing your
graphic size, it's important


92
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,866
to include plenty of spacing


93
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,456
between those elements
on screen.


94
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,756
This will help people
see each individual item.


95
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,646
And it makes them easier
to navigate and select.


96
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:34,336
Now, grid layouts tend to work
really well on the Apple TV.


97
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:37,716
And if you use a grid
layout note that if all


98
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:41,926
of your content doesn't fit onto
a single screen, you can elude


99
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,206
to those off-screen items.


100
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:45,876
This will let people know
they can navigate there.


101
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:50,036
And only those partially
off-screen items should appear


102
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:51,066
in this zone.


103
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:56,566
So, for Apple TV, if you want
a jump start on your designs,


104
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,186
there's some templates
available,


105
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,986
and they're all highly
customizable.


106
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,676
You have control over
the layout, size,


107
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,776
background, tinting, and more.


108
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:10,136
You can find these on the
tvOS Interface Guidelines.


109
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,856
And I'll include a link to them
at the end of this talk today.


110
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,096
So, now let's talk about text.


111
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:22,226
Let's just imagine we're
in a really big room


112
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,936
and we're sitting away
from a big screen.


113
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:26,586
All right.


114
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,706
So, let's just toss some
text up on that screen.


115
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:32,366
And can anybody see this?


116
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:35,166
Well? Somewhat.


117
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,606
Okay. People in the
front, I know you can.


118
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,776
But, people in the back, it
might be a little bit harder.


119
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,596
So, what's my point?


120
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:45,486
Make your text much
larger on the TV.


121
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,856
This will insure your
titles, buttons, labels,


122
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:50,886
and descriptions
will all be legible.


123
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,216
But, increasing the point
size isn't the only thing


124
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,216
that you can do for
text on screen.


125
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,706
You can also use a heavier font
weight to increase legibility.


126
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:05,716
This weight is significantly
easier to see than this one.


127
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:11,406
So, when you're evaluating a
font for your Apple TV app,


128
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,956
font's with weights like
regular, medium, semi-bold,


129
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:17,076
and bold are all great options.


130
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:21,366
And you typically want to avoid
fonts that are light or thin.


131
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,766
So, if you have a brand
font that is thin,


132
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,806
I highly recommend
prioritizing legibility.


133
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,856
And then see where you can
integrate a heavier font weight.


134
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:34,086
Even if it's just up to
regular, because it will be


135
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,106
so much easier to see on the TV.


136
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,666
And I know that beautiful,
thin font weight is a part


137
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,806
of your brand identity.


138
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:45,536
But, if people can't read
the text in your app,


139
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,246
it's going to be a
poor user experience.


140
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:49,486
And that's going to reflect
poorly on your brand.


141
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:54,186
So, in the system, we
use this great font


142
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:55,506
and it's called San Francisco.


143
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:57,926
There are two variants
of this font.


144
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:01,826
Both of which were designed for
high legibility on a big screen.


145
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,726
There's San Francisco text
and San Francisco display.


146
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,576
So, let's take a look
at them in the system.


147
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,596
This is San Francisco
on Apple TV.


148
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,996
And when you use San
Francisco in your apps,


149
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,236
tvOS automatically applies the
most appropriate text style


150
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:20,386
based on point size.


151
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,306
And it's going to respect
accessibility settings


152
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:25,466
such as bold type.


153
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:29,026
San Francisco will work
great in most apps.


154
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,596
But, if you need to
use a custom font,


155
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:35,285
make sure that it respects
accessibility settings,


156
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:37,556
and it's legible
from a distance.


157
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:44,145
So, for example, in Badland they
use a custom font that fits well


158
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,856
within the style of the game.


159
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,556
It reads clearly across the room


160
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:49,946
because of its heavier
font weight.


161
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,086
So, unless your app
has a compelling reason


162
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:55,876
for a custom font, stick
with San Francisco,


163
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,916
because above all text on
screen must be legible.


164
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:05,236
So, I've only touched
on a few pieces of what


165
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:06,846
to consider with text on screen.


166
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:11,066
If you want to learn more about
type, I recommend checking


167
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,736
out the Typography and Font
talk happening tomorrow morning


168
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:16,036
on this stage with
my friend, Antonio.


169
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:21,326
So, we've already
covered layout, graphics,


170
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,866
spacing, templates, and text.


171
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,226
All to accommodate
for the distance


172
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:28,496
between us and the TV screen.


173
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,676
But, there's still one
more thing to consider.


174
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:34,086
And that is your apps hierarchy.


175
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,986
Keep your app approachable
on Apple TV.


176
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:41,326
Do you remember how you
could just turn on TV


177
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,496
and just instantly be
watching your favorite show?


178
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:48,016
Well, that ease and instant
access should still hold true


179
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,886
to your apps on the
Apple TV today.


180
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,476
So, in designing your apps
hierarchy, keep it simple.


181
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:58,316
Let people jump immediately
into your apps experience.


182
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,726
Too many choices or options
can easily overwhelm,


183
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,486
which will add a psychological
distance in addition


184
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:07,506
to the physical distance
from the TV screen.


185
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,236
So, if you have a
lot of content,


186
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:13,946
a great way to simplify your
app is to use a tab bar.


187
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:17,356
This will instantly
flatten your apps hierarchy


188
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:20,426
and it'll organize all of your
content into different sections


189
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,786
that are quick and
easy to access.


190
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:27,106
Each tab bar should provide
value and easy navigation


191
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:29,706
from the top level of your app.


192
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,276
And if you use a tab
bar all tabs should fit


193
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:33,096
on the screen at once.


194
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:36,496
And don't just use it as
your apps junk drawer.


195
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,036
If you need to declutter
your app,


196
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:43,196
I recommend placing your app
settings in system settings.


197
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,876
People tend to only go
to settings once and so


198
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:49,556
that you don't need to waste
space for it in your tab bar


199
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:52,086
or in the main level
of your app.


200
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:57,066
So, to recap, when
designing for Apple TV,


201
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,046
remember on average
there's a 10 foot distance


202
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,486
between you and the screen.


203
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,236
And to accommodate
for that distance,


204
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,346
you want to use larger
graphics and interface elements.


205
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:11,326
You want to provide adequate
spacing between those elements


206
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:15,066
so they're easier to see,
navigate, and select.


207
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:19,316
With text, legibility
is essential.


208
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,766
Use large point sizes
and heavier font weights.


209
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:26,556
So, don't be afraid to go big
and bold with your text on TV.


210
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:31,076
And remember to keep
your app approachable


211
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:32,726
with a very simple hierarchy.


212
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:36,926
Don't add to the distance with
an overly complicated app.


213
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,746
And there's actually
a really easy way


214
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,366
to check your designs
before jumping into Xcode.


215
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:46,716
And that is to toss your wire
frames or concept with AirPlay


216
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,946
and review your layout,
spacing, graphics,


217
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:52,846
and text on an actual
TV across the room.


218
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,826
And you can ask yourself,


219
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:57,766
can you see everything
clearly from 10 feet away?


220
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:01,576
And is it easy to jump
into your apps experience.


221
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,646
I know this may seem like
a really obvious point,


222
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:08,756
but I've been in many UI
reviews were the majority


223
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,006
of issues could have been caught


224
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:12,376
if the app had simply
been checked


225
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:15,906
on an actual TV across the room.


226
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:19,956
I've seen some really great
seasoned iOS developers get


227
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,996
tripped up on designing
for the Apple TV,


228
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,506
because they have not
designed with distance in mind.


229
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:29,276
If you don't have a TV to
review your app on, get one.


230
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:33,366
And don't just, yeah, and
don't just place it next


231
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,326
to you at your desk.


232
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:38,696
You need to place it across
the room, because if you do all


233
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:42,296
of that, people will be able to
see clearly what's on screen.


234
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:45,156
And they will love being
able to jump immediately


235
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,436
into your apps experience.


236
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,736
So, that's designing
for distance on tvOS.


237
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:55,636
And because of that distance,
we interact with the TV


238
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:59,426
with the remote, which is the
second key factor that you need


239
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,226
to consider when
designing for tvOS.


240
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:07,876
So, as I mentioned, the rest
of our devices, where you look


241
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:09,976
and where you interact
is the same.


242
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:13,316
However, on the Apple
TV, where you look


243
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:15,096
and where you interact
is separate.


244
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,776
The Siri Remote allows
us to connect


245
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:21,176
with the TV screen
that's far away from us.


246
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:25,416
And people want to be
immersed with what's on screen.


247
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:29,056
They expect interacting
to be easy and intuitive.


248
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:33,136
So, if they have to look down
at the remote and guess how


249
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:37,566
to go back, the connection with
your app on screen is broken.


250
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,236
So, to avoid breaking


251
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,826
that connection you
should implement your app


252
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,766
to work seamlessly
with the Siri Remote.


253
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:48,836
And to do that, you need to
know how the Siri Remote works.


254
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,706
First, there's a touch surface


255
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,076
on the Siri Remote
where you can swipe.


256
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:58,466
And that's going to move focus
up, down, left, and right.


257
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:01,176
And that's typically used
for scrolling on screen.


258
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,736
You can also click
on the touch surface


259
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,096
and that activates a
control or selects an item.


260
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,716
You can also click
and hold if you want


261
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,036
to enter into an edit state.


262
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:14,506
And this could also be great
in a game if you want to select


263
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,866
and drag an item
around on screen.


264
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,236
And finally you can
tap, which navigates


265
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,116
through a collection one by one.


266
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:26,156
But, it's also a really
easy gesture to repeat.


267
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,306
So, it could be great in a game
if a quick response is needed


268
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:34,936
as long as that action is
different from a click.


269
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:36,456
So, moving on to the buttons.


270
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:37,876
You have the menu button.


271
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,536
And pressing this should return
you to the previous screen.


272
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:44,226
There's Play/Pause,
which should do exactly


273
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:45,406
that during media playback.


274
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:48,306
And it's also a great
secondary trigger in games.


275
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:52,786
And also remember that you
can leverage the remotes


276
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:56,386
accelerometer, gyroscope,
and use it in landscape mode.


277
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,226
Siri, home, and the volume
buttons are all reserved


278
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:01,876
for the system.


279
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:06,866
But, I want to go back
and give menu a little bit


280
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:12,606
of special attention, and give
you some detail on how it works.


281
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:14,566
So, here's your app hierarchy.


282
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,906
If you click, that's
going to take you deeper


283
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,996
into each level of your app.


284
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:23,146
And pressing menu will return
you to the previous screen.


285
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:28,346
This is the correct and expected
behavior of menu in most apps.


286
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:32,556
However, only in
games on a pause menu,


287
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:34,166
there's a slight variation,


288
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,006
and I'll like to
show that to you now.


289
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,946
So, for example in the
game, Rayman Adventures,


290
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,106
if I press menu while
playing the game,


291
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:45,126
I'm presented with a pause menu.


292
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:49,586
And because we're used to
pressing the same button


293
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:51,546
to bring us out of
a pause state,


294
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,236
pressing menu here
would resume the game.


295
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:57,776
So, it's important to
include a place on this menu


296
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:58,886
to exit out of the game.


297
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:01,606
So, in this case
it's the map icon.


298
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:04,596
And if I navigate to
that, that will take me


299
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,186
to the level selection screen.


300
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,606
And this is where menu
resumes its expected behavior.


301
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,536
If you press menu, it brings you
back to the game start screen.


302
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:15,816
And with one more
press you're back


303
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:17,066
on the Apple TV home screen.


304
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:21,366
So, that's how the
Siri Remote works.


305
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:25,006
And it should behave exactly
like that in your app or game.


306
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:30,766
So, as you may have heard in a
keynote, there is a fantastic,


307
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,476
new remote app that works
just like a Siri Remote.


308
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,486
It has a great game
controller layout.


309
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:40,296
And speaking of game
controllers,


310
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,486
if your game has an
advanced input mechanic


311
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,756
that can't be supported
by the Siri Remote,


312
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,736
you can now require the
use of the game controller.


313
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,006
And if your game
is controller only,


314
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,306
or if you support game
controllers in addition


315
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:59,496
to the Siri Remote, make sure
that your app allows people


316
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:03,396
to navigate through the Apple TV
UI in addition to play the game.


317
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:07,006
And you should always
gracefully inform people


318
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:10,445
if a controller is required,
or if one is not connected,


319
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:16,205
because your app can be
launched at any time.


320
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:19,036
And even though your game may
be enhanced with a controller,


321
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,636
remember that the
Siri Remote comes


322
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:23,226
with every single Apple TV.


323
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,846
And a controller is
an optional purchase.


324
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,016
So, if you go controller
only, you could be missing


325
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,616
out on new players who want


326
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,796
to try your game first before
purchasing a controller.


327
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:40,406
So, remember, with Apple TV,
people's eyes are onscreen


328
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,886
and they don't want to look
down, or think about how


329
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,346
to navigate, or interact.


330
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,616
So, use intuitive gestures
and expected button behaviors.


331
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,016
And if your app works
seamlessly with the Siri Remote,


332
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:54,786
new remote app, and
game controllers,


333
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:57,746
people will stay connect
to your apps experience.


334
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:02,516
So, what do all of these
devices control on screen?


335
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,286
They control focus.


336
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:10,076
And focus needs to be obvious so
people know what is actionable.


337
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,936
So, on Apple TV,
focus is identified


338
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:18,336
when an object is elevated,
and it responds with parallax


339
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,406
to subtle movements on the touch
surface of the Siri Remote.


340
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,906
Did you all notice how your
eyes were immediately drawn


341
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:25,676
to that movement?


342
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,166
Well, that's exactly
what you want.


343
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,926
And that's why the system
focus model is so great.


344
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:37,856
People expect to be able to
tap, and also swipe to be able


345
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:39,526
to navigate around onscreen.


346
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:41,396
And they should always
know where they are


347
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:42,766
and what's actionable.


348
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,316
So, now watch closely.


349
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:49,496
This will be a very slow
and controlled swipe


350
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,416
to illustrate something unique
about the system focus model.


351
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:56,796
Notice how it gently indicates


352
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:59,216
which direction you're
navigating onscreen.


353
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:02,046
And this helps aid
in navigation.


354
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,386
This focus model is used
throughout the system.


355
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:08,286
And this consistent look


356
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:10,936
and feel helps maintain
the connection that we have


357
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:12,276
with what's on screen.


358
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,156
So, use the system focus model.


359
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:20,406
Only in a few special
cases, most common in games,


360
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:23,206
you may want to customize
the focus appearance.


361
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:30,006
So, for example, back in Badland
they use animation for focus.


362
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,456
And this fits well within the
style of the game, and it works


363
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:35,156
because focus is obvious.


364
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:39,786
So, if you want to learn more
about UI Kit and the focus API,


365
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,206
check out the Focus
and Interaction


366
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:45,596
on tvOS session tomorrow
at 4:00 in Mission.


367
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:53,106
So, with your app icon on
Apple TV, you should design


368
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,976
with focus and parallax in mind.


369
00:19:57,066 --> 00:20:00,306
You can create some pretty cool
effects with image layering,


370
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:02,666
transparency, scaling,
and motion.


371
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,156
And there's a great parallax
preview tool that I'll


372
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:10,936
in include in the
resources for this talk.


373
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:15,336
So, when you're designing
your app for Apple TV,


374
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,456
you should use intuitive
gestures


375
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:20,306
and expected button behaviors
such as, menu, returning you


376
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:21,366
to the previous screen.


377
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,326
And implement your
app to work seamlessly


378
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:27,866
with the Siri Remote's new
remote app and game controllers.


379
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:31,416
You should use the
system focus model


380
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,386
for clarity and consistency.


381
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,576
That way people will feel like
they're interacting directly


382
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:39,436
with the screen even though
it may be 10 feet away.


383
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:44,076
And if you make a
custom focus appearance,


384
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,576
be sure to make focus obvious.


385
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:50,006
And focus should always move
in the expected direction


386
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:51,496
to help aid in navigation.


387
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:56,966
And finally with the
remote, it's most important


388
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,926
that you don't break people's
connection with what's onscreen.


389
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:06,816
So, that's designing
for the remote on tvOS.


390
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:07,326
All right.


391
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:10,406
Awesome. We've made
it to features.


392
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,586
And there are a lot of great
new features in tvOS 10.


393
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:18,336
For those of you who were in
this room before, you heard all


394
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:21,276
about these directly from
the engineering team.


395
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:24,986
And don't worry, if you missed
it and came just for design,


396
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,506
first, thank you so much.


397
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,736
And secondly, you
can catch up on


398
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:31,956
that session on your WWDC app.


399
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:34,676
So, I'm just going
to be focusing


400
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:36,566
on the new appearance feature,


401
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:39,946
because that is what
directly impacts your designs.


402
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:46,846
There is now light and dark
appearance on the Apple TV.


403
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:49,896
And this is user
specified in settings.


404
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:52,556
And it changes the look
of the entire system.


405
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,766
Pretty much every single
control has been adjusted


406
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,906
to some degree for
dark appearance.


407
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:00,266
This include place
holder images,


408
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,876
they're dark instead of light.


409
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,696
Shadows have different values.


410
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,486
And this is a great
new feature on tvOS.


411
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:12,276
So, to support dark appearance,
your app needs to opt in.


412
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:15,146
And I encourage you to do
so, because you've seen


413
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:17,976
in this talk today
how awesome it is.


414
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:23,296
So, opt in and your app will
respect people's preferences


415
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:25,466
on how they wish to
experience their TV


416
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,086
in their own environment.


417
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:32,576
Now, user preferences also
apply to accessibility.


418
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:37,486
And Apple TV is packed full
of accessibility features


419
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:40,266
that provide the best user
experience for everyone.


420
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:45,276
Apps implementing custom fonts
should match the accessibility


421
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:49,176
behavior of system fonts and
respect settings like bold type.


422
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,056
Accessibility options
also can change contrast,


423
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:55,166
reduce motion, and more.


424
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:57,566
So, if you have a
UIKit based app


425
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:01,336
that could be made accessible
for very little effort.


426
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:04,576
So, I encourage you to check out
these sessions to learn more.


427
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:11,646
So, appearance and accessibility
features are powerful


428
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:12,746
on tvOS 10.


429
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:16,016
And I'm looking forward to
seeing your apps support them.


430
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:18,466
So, that's features.


431
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,886
Now, I would love to
show you a few apps


432
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:27,376
that have not only designed
for distance and the remote,


433
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:31,896
but they're also changing
what we expect from the TV.


434
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:36,826
So, first this app is Zova.


435
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,446
And it's a lifestyle fitness
app that turns your living room


436
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:42,156
into a yoga studio or place


437
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:43,406
where you could workout
with a friend.


438
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,156
Not only is this significantly
better than investing


439
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:50,776
in some workout DVD's, but
it also works beautifully


440
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,036
on Apple TV, because
it's so easy


441
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:56,076
to find a workout
that you want to do.


442
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,406
It has a great well
spaced layout.


443
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:02,546
It's very easy to navigate and
find exactly what you're looking


444
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:04,136
for right from this main screen.


445
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,076
And with one click
from the main screen,


446
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:09,006
you're instantly into a workout.


447
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:10,746
That's it.


448
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:13,126
Main screen to workout.


449
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:14,716
It's that easy.


450
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:17,376
And it's not overwhelming,
which is great,


451
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:19,806
because you don't want
any additional barriers


452
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,846
between you and getting fit.


453
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:25,136
Zova does a great job
with their layout,


454
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:28,086
because they use large graphics,
and it keeps you focused


455
00:24:28,086 --> 00:24:29,926
on the content of the app.


456
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:33,486
This app also does something
that is really great.


457
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:38,706
If you put Zova in the top shelf
of your Apple TV, you'll be able


458
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:40,916
to jump immediately
into a workout,


459
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:44,096
because it uses dynamic
content in the top shelf.


460
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:46,836
If you want to find
out more about it,


461
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:50,486
I will link to the Apple TV Tech
Talks and the resources today.


462
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:52,906
So, that is Zova.


463
00:24:53,806 --> 00:25:00,206
This next app that I want to
show you is called, Reuters TV.


464
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:04,756
And Reuters really
reimagined what news could be


465
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:06,066
on the Apple TV.


466
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,746
If you think about traditional
news, when you turn it


467
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:12,926
on you may be popping in five
minutes late to a broadcast


468
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,546
and you've already missed all of
the big news stories of the day.


469
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:19,076
And I know you can
definitely get all your news


470
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,696
from the internet, but
if you really wanted


471
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:26,026
to just watch a nice segment
that had everything you needed


472
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,966
to know, well, wouldn't
that be great?


473
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,996
Well, that's exactly
what Reuters did.


474
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:36,996
When you open this app you
only have one decision to make.


475
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:41,286
And that is, how much time do
you have for the news today?


476
00:25:42,446 --> 00:25:44,086
You make a single action.


477
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:47,726
You choose whether that's
10, 15, or 30 minutes.


478
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:49,376
And as soon as you select one,


479
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,026
you are immediately
into the experience.


480
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:55,296
You're given a quick
trailer of what videos are


481
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:58,326
in your playlist, and then
you're watching the news.


482
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,496
If you wanted to swipe up
to reveal that playlist,


483
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,746
you can jump to stories that
you are more interested in.


484
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,346
And that's the beauty of
next level on demand content.


485
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,156
Not only did I choose when
I wanted to watch this,


486
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,486
but I was also easily
able to skip


487
00:26:15,566 --> 00:26:17,716
to what I wanted
to watch with ease.


488
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:21,496
This app makes it possible
to watch the news again.


489
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:27,256
Now, while there's an amazing
team who's behind providing all


490
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:31,956
of this news content, the apps
focused experience is what truly


491
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:32,676
makes it great.


492
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:33,466
All right.


493
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:37,106
So, that is Reuters TV.


494
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:40,246
Next up is a game.


495
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:43,986
And this game is
called, Chameleon Run.


496
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:48,406
This is a colorful,
fun, auto-runner game,


497
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,036
and you may be familiar with it,


498
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:52,316
because it is an ADA
winner this year.


499
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,376
But, that's not why
I'm including it.


500
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,896
I have it here for a
completely different reason.


501
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:00,796
So, let's just say that I
downloaded Chameleon Run


502
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:04,106
from the app store, and I've
never launched this game before.


503
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,936
So, let's just see what
happens when I click open.


504
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:22,536
Did you guys see that?


505
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,486
It was awesome.


506
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:26,946
We were instantly into the game.


507
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:28,266
We just started playing.


508
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,876
Right from launch you're in
and you're playing the game.


509
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:33,576
And that is awesome.


510
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,776
So, now I just want to continue


511
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:38,346
through this first
level a little bit more,


512
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:42,306
because there's something
else special that is going on.


513
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:47,166
You are reading a text,
and seeing the animation


514
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,466
on the Siri Remote, and
watching your runner,


515
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,346
all at the same time.


516
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,186
The texting graphics are clear.


517
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:57,846
So, you're able to play and
learn at the exact same time.


518
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,836
And that is fantastic.


519
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:02,816
So, let's just fast forward
to the end of this level.


520
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,326
I assure you I landed
every single jump


521
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:08,426
and I only had to
cut this for time.


522
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:10,526
So, when you pass
this first level,


523
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:14,316
which is your first experience
in the game, you get this party.


524
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,516
And you feel great.


525
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,106
You feel accomplished.


526
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,296
And now you're just
welcomed to play more.


527
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:24,356
Chameleon Run is so much
fun on the Siri Remote.


528
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:26,236
It has great game play.


529
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,376
And they support
game controllers too.


530
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:32,326
But, most of all I love
that you're immediately able


531
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:35,246
to jump into the game.


532
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:38,316
Now, granted not every single
app or game can do this.


533
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:41,716
But, you should still
consider what you need to do


534
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:45,046
to make your apps experience
easy, and as quick to jump


535
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:48,836
to as possible, because
that's why people are there.


536
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,906
They just want to
jump into your app.


537
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,016
And that's Chameleon Run.


538
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:57,966
This final app is unique.


539
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,476
And it is called, Late Shift.


540
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,926
This is a cinematic game


541
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:06,256
that lets you control
the main character.


542
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:10,506
Decisions you make change
what happens in the movie.


543
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:13,276
And if you want to watch
and play with friends,


544
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:16,016
there's a companion app for the
iPhone that you can download


545
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:17,296
and make decisions together.


546
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:21,596
So, potentially you
could have a protagonist


547
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:23,256
that then turns into
an antagonist.


548
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:26,756
This is a
choose-your-own-adventure game


549
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:30,806
with a really easy
navigation, navigational bottle


550
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,096
and a very simple
level selection UI.


551
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:37,506
And the majority of your
experience is inside this film.


552
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,836
And this game play is
great on the big screen.


553
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:43,816
You control the movie's
plot from your Siri Remote.


554
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:46,316
The onboarding is integrated


555
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:47,826
into the first level's
voice over.


556
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:50,456
And it lets you know
the important of choice.


557
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:54,436
Late Shift is an intriguing,
entertainment hybrid


558
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,386
that I'm really excited
to see emerging


559
00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:58,856
in apps on the Apple TV.


560
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:06,676
So, we just took a look at
a workout app, a news app,


561
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,426
an auto-runner, and an
entertainment hybrid.


562
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,396
So, what do all these
apps have in common?


563
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:17,126
Well, they all design for
distance and the remote.


564
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:19,936
But, they also really thought


565
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:24,556
about what their app could do
differently on the Apple TV.


566
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:26,676
While we've gone through
a few examples today's,


567
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:29,636
remember that TV's are not
just in your living room.


568
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,976
They're in classrooms,
in offices,


569
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:35,276
conferences, airports, and more.


570
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:39,466
So, what do you want your
apps TV experience to be?


571
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,276
You need to get into the mindset


572
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,556
of what you want
to do on the TV.


573
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:48,716
And then how to elevate
it with tvOS.


574
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:50,806
This is not a traditional
device,


575
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:53,316
so why have a traditional
experience?


576
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:57,386
We are on the precipice
of change for the TV.


577
00:30:58,016 --> 00:31:00,596
And the TV deserves
your fresh prospective,


578
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:04,886
because you can create
something powerful and new


579
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,076
that people will love.


580
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,616
So, if there's just one
thing that you take away


581
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:15,986
from this talk today
it is, design for TV.


582
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,556
For more information including
related resources and the video


583
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,816
of this session,
check out this link.


584
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,636
This is has been session 802.


585
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,176
And there are a lot of
great related sessions,


586
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:32,236
including the Typography and
Fonts, and Focus Interaction


587
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,046
on tvOS Talk that I mentioned.


588
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,566
And there's a great design
talk that's happening on Friday


589
00:31:37,566 --> 00:31:41,526
at 10 AM, here on this stage,
called Iterative UI Design.


590
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:44,346
And if you have an idea for
an app and you don't know how


591
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:47,446
to get started, that would
be a great talk to attend.


592
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:49,996
This has been Designing
for tvOS.


593
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,316
Have a great conference.


594
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:56,500
[ Applause ]
