 Abstract: Manages the display of pages for a given document to display. This is the view that you will use in Interface Builder or create directly to display and interact with an AttributedStringDoc in an application. 
 It is also fair to say that this view acts as a controller for CoreTextViews. You can change the page to display, manage text selection, and change font parameters for the document.
