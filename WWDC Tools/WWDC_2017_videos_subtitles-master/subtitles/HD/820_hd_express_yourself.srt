[ Cheering ]


2
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:22,746
>> Today I am going to talk


3
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:23,886
about iMessage apps.


4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,656
The iMessage App Store is only a


5
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,116
year old, and there are already


6
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:28,806
so many great apps, and so many


7
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:29,796
new experiences.


8
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,636
There are also many more yet to


9
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:32,345
be discovered.


10
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:33,866
An essential part of the


11
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,006
iMessage App experience is


12
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:36,486
Stickers.


13
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:38,556
Stickers have done so much to


14
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:39,846
brighten our conversations.


15
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,026
There are so many different


16
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:42,676
types of Stickers, even animated


17
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,066
ones.


18
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:44,356
Look at all the Stickers here.


19
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:45,766
And these are only the Apple


20
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:46,256
ones.


21
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,546
Let's take a look at what makes


22
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,166
them so great.


23
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,416
Going to jump into a


24
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,996
conversation, and my friend sent


25
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,386
me this image of a show that we


26
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:53,806
went to.


27
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:54,536
I'm going to react with a


28
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:54,966
Sticker.


29
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:58,086
Going to pick this thumbs-up one


30
00:00:58,086 --> 00:01:00,516
here, tap and hold to peel, and


31
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:02,286
put it where I want it, scale,


32
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:03,706
rotate, and drop it there.


33
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,075
I'm going to add another


34
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:06,686
Sticker, just to be extra fun


35
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,076
with it.


36
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:08,416
Pick this one.


37
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,316
And I think I'm going to send


38
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,436
this one with a full screen


39
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:10,776
effect.


40
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:13,286
This new echo one that Mac


41
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:14,046
worked on is great.


42
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:17,956
What makes the Sticker


43
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:19,666
experience so effective is that


44
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,146
it's flexible.


45
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,866
With the expandable App drawer,


46
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,256
I can use the half screen and


47
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,186
full screen view to find exactly


48
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,186
the Sticker that I want.


49
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,116
It is fast.


50
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,516
It is easy, and light.


51
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,256
In other words, it's convenient.


52
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:36,096
Prior to Stickers, you could not


53
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,496
respond to an older bubble in


54
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,586
the conversation, and you


55
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:40,066
definitely couldn't overlay


56
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,296
images on top of bubbles.


57
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,726
That is a game changer.


58
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,516
I could pick my Sticker, and put


59
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,796
it exactly where I want it,


60
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,436
transforming the conversation


61
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,716
for both of us to enjoy.


62
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,466
Using Stickers is playful, and


63
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:53,866
personal.


64
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:56,936
There are so many different


65
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,266
types of ways to send Stickers,


66
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:00,106
expressing yourself in unique


67
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:01,766
and colorful ways is fun.


68
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,846
That animation is so cool.


69
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,436
We've seen how being convenient,


70
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,096
personal and fun are part of


71
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,306
what makes Stickers such a great


72
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,046
experience.


73
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,776
But what works for Stickers can


74
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:16,926
also work for other apps.


75
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:19,926
Like expressive apps, sharing


76
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,216
apps, and collaborative apps.


77
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:23,946
Let's focus on expressive apps.


78
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,356
Here is one that I love.


79
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:31,176
Tumblr. Tumblr's iOS app is a


80
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,486
social media destination


81
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:34,266
optimized for sharing photos and


82
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,396
gifts, but that doesn't


83
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,116
necessarily translate into


84
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,646
person to person communication.


85
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,826
So they made something


86
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,266
different.


87
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:41,726
They made a GIF generator.


88
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,426
Going to jump into another app


89
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:45,576
here, and pick a video that I


90
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:45,886
made.


91
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,436
Cool. I can set the playback


92
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,776
behavior, and speed it up a


93
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,836
little bit.


94
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,726
My friend is having a bad day,


95
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:56,866
so I'm going to send him a fun


96
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:57,536
little message.


97
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,246
Bounce back, Homey!


98
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:02,996
I could pick the color.


99
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:06,296
And change the font.


100
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,596
Scale and rotate.


101
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,156
Get that frog in there, nice.


102
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:12,856
And send it.


103
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:16,746
Cool.


104
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:21,076
Tumblr made a robust GIF editor


105
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,746
allowing you to trim your video,


106
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:24,536
control the play speed, and set


107
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,446
playback behavior.


108
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,716
It is so powerful, and lives


109
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:28,856
right within messages.


110
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,776
The whole process is lightweight


111
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,516
and convenient.


112
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:35,526
You can also customize text,


113
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,496
setting the font style, color,


114
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,066
scale and rotation to


115
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,126
personalize your GIF.


116
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:42,116
All these decisions make your


117
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:43,966
GIF special for both you and the


118
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,016
person you're sending it to.


119
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,436
And it's fun to see the GIF that


120
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:53,006
you just created looping in your


121
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:53,816
conversation.


122
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:54,996
I know this is going to get a


123
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:55,736
good reaction.


124
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,736
We've seen how Tumblr has made a


125
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,526
robust, expressive app that is


126
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:03,746
so different from Stickers, yet


127
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,296
it maintains the core qualities


128
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:08,116
of a successful iMessage app.


129
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,276
Let's see how it works for a


130
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:09,956
sharing app.


131
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:12,196
Here is an awesome app.


132
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,186
Dunkin Donuts.


133
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,766
Their iOS app is filled with all


134
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:18,606
kinds of stuff.


135
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:20,505
You can see your rewards, find


136
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:22,926
locations, see the menu, order


137
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:23,356
drinks.


138
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:24,916
But all these features don't


139
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,756
necessarily translate into a


140
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,206
conversational experience.


141
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:29,816
But one part definitely does.


142
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:30,956
Gift cards.


143
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:33,106
Going to go in here.


144
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,586
My friend just helped me move,


145
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:35,426
so I'm going to send him a gift


146
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:35,766
card.


147
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,506
And he was kind of lazy, so I'm


148
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:39,406
only going to send him five


149
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:39,756
bucks.


150
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:43,456
Going to pick the right gift


151
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:43,796
card.


152
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:44,726
How about "You're one in a


153
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:45,176
million"?


154
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:46,206
That is kind of silly, right?


155
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:49,336
And use the Apple Pay sheet, and


156
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,506
boom, just like that.


157
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,506
I just sent a gift card.


158
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:58,556
Apple Pay allows you to perform


159
00:04:58,556 --> 00:04:59,856
financial transactions without


160
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:00,786
leaving messages.


161
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,106
It is super convenient.


162
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,306
These cards look really nice.


163
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:06,846
Maybe it's your nephew's


164
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:08,376
graduation or a friend's


165
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,746
birthday, or you want to let


166
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:10,456
someone know that you're


167
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:11,196
thinking about them.


168
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,596
Sending a gift card is a great


169
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:13,166
way to do it.


170
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,526
Everyone loves donuts.


171
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,636
And giving is fun.


172
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,056
Being kind is fun.


173
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,466
The person receiving this is


174
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,576
probably going to be really


175
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,176
surprised.


176
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:30,146
So the Dunkin Donuts app is so


177
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,386
different than Stickers and


178
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:33,106
Tumblr, it still works well


179
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:34,206
because it embodies the same


180
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:34,936
three qualities.


181
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,136
There are also collaborative


182
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,876
apps, like games and polling.


183
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,166
Games and polling rely on both


184
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,106
parties to participate, to make


185
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:45,506
the most of the app experience.


186
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:46,796
I'm going to share with you one


187
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,266
of my favorite apps.


188
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:52,586
Tinder. Tinder is a popular


189
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,956
dating app, but you're probably


190
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:55,386
asking yourself how does a


191
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,556
dating app find its way into


192
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,226
messages?


193
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:00,356
One of the core features of


194
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,496
Tinder is Stacks.


195
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:03,316
A data can upload a set of


196
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,396
images, or create a stack, to


197
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:06,716
attract potential connections.


198
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,786
I am going to go here and create


199
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,226
a stack.


200
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:11,766
I'm having a little personal


201
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:14,096
crisis today, so maybe my friend


202
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:14,566
could help me.


203
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,236
I really need to know what shoes


204
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:17,846
I should wear today.


205
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,986
Going to pick my images, name my


206
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:25,046
stack, and vote on my own stack.


207
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,376
I really love all of these, so


208
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:27,976
hopefully I can get some help.


209
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:30,756
Then I just sent a poll.


210
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,456
Imagine if you had to create a


211
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:36,566
poll without using this app.


212
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:37,376
You would have to send these


213
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,756
images individually.


214
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,166
And how would people vote for


215
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:40,436
them?


216
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,676
They would have to say leather


217
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:43,986
boots, or yellow sneakers.


218
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:45,306
But here, they could just cast


219
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:45,806
their vote.


220
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,806
Making polls with Tinder is so


221
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:48,286
easy.


222
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,596
I have the Tinder app just so I


223
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:51,516
could use this feature


224
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:54,526
[laughter].


225
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,646
Taking a poll is personal.


226
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:57,956
You're sharing a personal set of


227
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:01,006
images, selfies, sneakers, food,


228
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,586
or whatever, you're asking a


229
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,166
trusted person for their opinion


230
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:04,976
because you care.


231
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:08,516
And it's fun.


232
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,186
It's fun to pick people's


233
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:10,636
brains.


234
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:12,836
It's fun to agree and disagree.


235
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,816
The poll evolves as people vote,


236
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,476
and becomes an enjoyable event


237
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,036
for everyone.


238
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:20,346
So whether you're making a


239
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:23,036
sticker pack, a GIF generator, a


240
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,726
gifting experience, or an image


241
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:27,836
poll, making them convenient,


242
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,956
personal and fun can make a huge


243
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,336
difference in the success of


244
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:31,926
your app.


245
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:36,166
Here are some tips to get


246
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:36,666
started.


247
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,426
Tumblr, Dunkin Donuts and Tinder


248
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,616
do not set out to put their


249
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:43,646
entire apps into messages, and


250
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:44,616
thankfully they didn't.


251
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,396
They integrated only features


252
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:47,246
that were focused on


253
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:47,996
communication.


254
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,206
Handcrafted messages are fun to


255
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,146
send and receive.


256
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,926
Find ways to let your users


257
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:56,156
create and customize the


258
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:56,916
experience.


259
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,586
You may find that there are ways


260
00:07:58,586 --> 00:07:59,826
to use your app that you never


261
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:00,596
even imagined.


262
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,826
You may discover new user bases,


263
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:04,366
like my experience with Tinder.


264
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:09,096
There are so many platform


265
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:10,966
tools, peel and place stickers,


266
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,866
Apple Pay sheet, access to the


267
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,656
microphone, camera and photos.


268
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,066
Think about what is best for


269
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,626
your app, and improve on an


270
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,336
existing experience, or create a


271
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:19,796
new one.


272
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:23,276
Because in the end, you want to


273
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:24,866
create a wonderful experience


274
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,376
for your family and friends.


275
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:28,356
Thank you.
