    Abstract:
    In order to properly clamp the MKMapView (see AAPLVisibleMapRegionDelegate) to inside a floorplan (that may not be "North up", and therefore may not be aligned with the standard MKMapRect coordinate frames), we'll need a way to store and quickly compute whether a specific MKMapPoint is inside your floorplan or not, and the displacement to the nearest edge of the floorplan.
    
                Since all PDF bounding boxes are still PDFs, after all, in the case of this sample code we need only represent a "rotated" MKMapRect. If you have transparency in your PDF or need something fancier, consider an MKPolygon and some combination of CGPathContainsPoint(), etc.

    We'd love to have that simplicity too, so our underlying main strategy is to
    simplify the problem. If we can answer the following two questions:
    1. how far away are you, from the rectangle, in the height direction?
    2. how far away are you, from the rectangle, in the width direction?

    Then we can use these values to take the exact same (simple) approach!
