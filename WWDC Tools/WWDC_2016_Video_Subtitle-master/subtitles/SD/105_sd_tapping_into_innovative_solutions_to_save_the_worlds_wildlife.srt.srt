00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:57,396
>> Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Ginette Hemley,


4
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:02,856
Senior Vice President,
Wildlife Conservation at WWF.

00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:09,545
[ Applause ]


6
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,826
>> Good afternoon, well I'm
really excited to be here


7
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:17,336
because this is not the type
of audience I usually address.


8
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:20,296
I'm not a developer,
as you've heard,


9
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:22,316
I'm head of Wildlife
Conservation


10
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:26,006
at World Wildlife Fund, which is
the leading organization working


11
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:30,756
globally to protect wild
places and wild species


12
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:33,986
and to reduce the human
footprint on the planet.


13
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:37,796
WWF has been around
for more than 50 years.


14
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:41,856
We work in more than 100
countries and we have more


15
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,046
than 6 million members
worldwide.


16
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,796
I'm usually talking to audiences
of conservation scientists


17
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:52,556
or policymakers like congress
or donors and supporters.


18
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,276
But one of the things
I want to talk to you


19
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,826
about today is how we're
beginning to use technology


20
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:02,126
to help save the planet and
to help conserve wildlife.


21
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:05,036
And it may surprise you to hear
about some of the interesting


22
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:08,506
and new ways we're using
technology to save wildlife.


23
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:14,336
But first, I want to
step back and take a look


24
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:15,766
at the state of the planet.


25
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:19,156
We don't hear a lot of good
news on this front these days,


26
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:23,236
we are in fact facing
unprecedented declines of some


27
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,516
of the world's most
magnificent wildlife.


28
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:32,016
But we're also on the cusp of
some amazing wildlife recoveries


29
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,576
and I'm going to tell you
about some of those today.


30
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,906
But first, here's the backdrop.


31
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,556
Our living planet
report tells us


32
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:46,026
that in the last 40 years
we've lost half the populations


33
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,446
of the world's vertebrate
species.


34
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,816
That's mammals, birds,
reptiles, amphibians, and fish.


35
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:58,436
It's affecting many of our most
iconic species, including rhinos


36
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,046
and tigers and elephants.


37
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:02,836
Why is this happening?


38
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:07,846
The reason it's happening
is twofold, habitat loss


39
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:12,996
and degradation and
illegal hunting or poaching.


40
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:18,336
Habitat loss is driven mainly
by agricultural expansion due


41
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,005
to growing human numbers,
the demand for food


42
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:25,766
and for commodities like
soy and palm oil and sugar.


43
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:30,646
Also developing infrastructure
like roads


44
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:33,606
and generally growing
urbanization.


45
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:38,316
And climate change is only
adding to the challenge


46
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:42,116
by creating increased
environmental stresses,


47
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:45,316
such as more intense
droughts and flooding,


48
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,336
which is impacting
a lot of things,


49
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,586
including wildlife migrations


50
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:53,906
and seasonal breeding
and feeding patterns.


51
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:57,986
Now simultaneously a
booming illegal trade


52
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,776
in wildlife products
is impacting some


53
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,306
of our most endangered species.


54
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:08,696
This is a trade that is valued
at, at least $20 billion a year


55
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,256
in wildlife and wildlife
products.


56
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,616
Which makes it one of the
top illegal enterprises


57
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:17,646
in the world amazingly
after narcotics and weapons


58
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:19,436
and human trafficking.


59
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:25,856
And it's taking its toll on some
of our most endangered species.


60
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:30,356
For example, a surge
in the trade of ivory


61
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,966
in recent years has led
to the death of as many


62
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,896
as 30,000 elephants a year.


63
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,636
Are traded for their ivory,
which is consumed mainly


64
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,836
in Asia, but also here
in the United States.


65
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:45,076
We are a major wildlife
consuming country,


66
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,406
which surprises a lot of people.


67
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:53,166
By the time I finish this talk
three elephants will have been


68
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,476
killed illegally
for their ivory.


69
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:06,206
Now surge in poaching of rhinos
in South Africa has happened


70
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:11,076
over the last decade from
13 animals killed in 2007


71
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:14,246
to over 1200 killed last year.


72
00:06:14,886 --> 00:06:19,066
This is driven by
demand in Vietnam mainly,


73
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:22,736
but also in China where rhino
horn is marketed as a cure


74
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:27,236
for cancer and unbelievably
as a hangover treatment.


75
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:31,626
And this latter use is a
recent fad and is not rooted


76
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,366
in any kind of traditional
medicine and neither


77
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:37,496
of these uses has any
proven medical efficacy.


78
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:42,846
And in the last century
we've lost 97%


79
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:46,486
of the world's wild
tigers, we're down to


80
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,566
as few as 3900 in the wild.


81
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:52,506
Tigers are killed illegally for
their skins, for their bones


82
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:54,246
and other body parts,
which are used


83
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,496
in modern-day health tonics.


84
00:06:56,896 --> 00:07:00,226
So it's a pretty grim
picture, there's no question


85
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:03,196
and people often ask me well
how do you not just get totally


86
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:04,896
discouraged all the
time in your work


87
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,986
with these horrifying statistics
and all the trends going


88
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:08,996
in the wrong direction.


89
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:13,306
And my response is well yes,
there are a lot of challenges


90
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:16,576
for sure, but we're making
important progress and in fact,


91
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:19,166
some of these trends are
beginning to be reversed.


92
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:25,136
And that is because I believe
that power and possibility.


93
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:28,926
I'm going to talk to you today
about the power of big ideas,


94
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:33,566
the power of technology, and
the power of communities.


95
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,546
Now I know these
are big concepts


96
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,816
that this conference is
famous for dealing with,


97
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:39,566
but what I want to
do today is put


98
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:42,296
into a wildlife conservation
context for you.


99
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:47,096
So let me tell you what's
happening with tigers.


100
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:52,996
Seven years ago tiger numbers
reached an all-time low.


101
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:57,216
When we look back now we realize
that something big had to happen


102
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,726
if tigers were going to survive.


103
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:02,926
So we came up with the idea
to hold a global summit


104
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,596
on tiger conservation.


105
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:07,466
That had never been done before
for an endangered species


106
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,126
and we wondered if anyone
would take us seriously.


107
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,176
With all the pressing
problems in the world


108
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,486
who would care about tigers.


109
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,086
Well, we found an
unlikely champion


110
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:21,456
in President Vladimir Putin
of Russia who it turns


111
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:25,026
out has a soft spot for
tigers, who would have guessed.


112
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:29,606
Well, we convinced him
to invite world leaders


113
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:32,296
to a unique gathering
in St. Petersburg,


114
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:36,116
Russia to chart a path
for the tiger's recovery.


115
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:42,285
We put forward an ambitious
challenge to double the number


116
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:45,746
of tigers in the wild
by the year 2022,


117
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,976
which is the next
Chinese year of the tiger.


118
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,086
We knew what it would
take to recover tigers,


119
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,546
it's a pretty simple formula.


120
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:58,206
They need healthy habitat,
they need enough prey to eat


121
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,156
and they need to be
protected from poaching.


122
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:07,596
We also knew that the main
missing ingredient was


123
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,546
political will.


124
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:14,076
Well fortunately, the leaders
of the 13 tiger range countries


125
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:16,186
and these are the countries
where tigers are still left


126
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:19,816
in the wild agreed
and they committed


127
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:23,046
to a bold new recovery
plan for tigers.


128
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:28,646
This was the first of its kind
ever for an endangered species.


129
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:34,146
We call this TX2, Doubling
Tigers in the Wild.


130
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:38,056
And this year marks the
halfway point to 2022.


131
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:42,786
And guess what, governments
in Asia are beginning


132
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,426
to implement the recovery plan


133
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:49,896
and tiger numbers are
beginning to grow in the wild.


134
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:55,856
For example, tigers have been
documented for the first time


135
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,736
as breeding in the wild
in northeast China.


136
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,166
And tigers have been recorded


137
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:04,906
in places they've
never been seen before


138
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:08,906
or documented before, which
is on the border of Thailand


139
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:11,536
and Myanmar, which is where
this video of a mother


140
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:14,000
and her cubs was
taken just last year.


141
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:25,296
For the first time in a century
overall tiger numbers are


142
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,216
beginning to tick
upward in the wild.


143
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,706
If we are successful
in reaching our goal


144
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,176
of doubling tigers it
will be I think one


145
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,506
of the greatest achievements
ever in wildlife conservation.


146
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:41,266
And personally, I
believe we can do it


147
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:44,246
because I've seen this
recovery firsthand.


148
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:52,046
So 20 years ago, gosh that
was probably before a lot


149
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,796
of you were born.


150
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:56,736
Twenty years ago
I visited a park


151
00:10:57,106 --> 00:11:00,256
in India called Ranthambore,
a tiger reserve.


152
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,566
It was a bad time for tigers,


153
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:07,286
poaching had hit many areas
really hard and Ranthambore,


154
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:10,456
which was once a tiger
stronghold was down to


155
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,666
about 10 tigers left
in the whole park.


156
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,706
The park was suffering
from bad management,


157
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:18,476
poor enforcement,
it was pretty bleak.


158
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,116
We saw almost no
wildlife at all and I left


159
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:23,396
that place thinking well there's
just no way this park can


160
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,686
survive with all the pressing
issues that India has to deal


161
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,506
with how can park
have any future.


162
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:35,226
Well this tiger named
Machali was born


163
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,086
about the time I
visited Ranthambore.


164
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:40,476
We didn't see her then,
but she was there in fact,


165
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:42,126
she did manage to survive.


166
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,896
In fact, she went
on to become one


167
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,926
of Ranthambore's
most famous tigers.


168
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:51,086
Well after I left Ranthambore
things got a little bit worse


169
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,636
in the park, but
then they got better.


170
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:57,296
The Indian government started
to invest in better enforcement,


171
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,636
more park rangers,
critical research


172
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,036
and things started
to turn around there.


173
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:05,736
And amazingly, tigers
have started to come back.


174
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:10,426
And Machali not only
did she survive she went


175
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:15,006
on to have 11 cubs with
two different mates,


176
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,346
one of them appropriately
called Big Daddy


177
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:19,176
because he was the
father of seven of them.


178
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:23,116
And then those cubs went
on to have another 20.


179
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,846
And so Machali's dynasty
includes more than 30 offspring


180
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:30,656
and many of them are
doing really well today.


181
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:36,046
Well I had the chance to go back


182
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,566
to Ranthambore just a few months
ago, in December of last year,


183
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,556
and I witnessed an
amazing transformation.


184
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,226
The park was teeming with life


185
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:48,676
and Ranthambore's tiger
numbers are now close to 60.


186
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:53,696
That's a number that actually
exceeds the carrying capacity


187
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:58,406
of the park, so much so that the
government is actually capturing


188
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:02,056
some tigers and relocating them
to other areas outside the park


189
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:05,056
and is planning a set of new
reserves for these tigers.


190
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:06,926
And that's unprecedented


191
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,436
in recent tiger conservation
history.


192
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:13,196
So I believe we can double the
number of tigers in the wild


193
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,316
if governments


194
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:17,656
and conservationists help
create the necessary conditions.


195
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:21,406
Perhaps the boldest idea


196
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:25,876
in tiger conservation today is
bringing tigers back to places


197
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:26,996
where they've become extinct.


198
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,506
And this is what Cambodia
is planning to do.


199
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,646
This photo was taken in 2007


200
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,206
and it's the last known
tiger in Cambodia.


201
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:39,176
None have been seen there since.


202
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:43,566
Well just three months ago the
Cambodian government announced a


203
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:47,736
plan to bring tigers back to
the eastern plains landscape


204
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:51,016
of the country, which is a
very biologically diverse area,


205
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:53,706
there's still a lot of
habitat, tigers can live there,


206
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,216
it's under pretty
serious threat,


207
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:57,576
but there's enough
habitat for tigers.


208
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:01,036
And we are working with
the Cambodian government


209
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,466
in several ways to help prepare


210
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,306
for this possible
reintroduction.


211
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:09,286
We're working to help bring
back the prey species,


212
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,666
such as the sambar
dear, kouprey,


213
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,856
which is a type of wild cattle.


214
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:16,436
These are important species
for the tigers to eat.


215
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:19,266
It happens to also be that
these species are popular


216
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,836
with local people and a lot
of them have been hunted


217
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:23,476
out because of poor enforcement.


218
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,506
So we're helping to
bring these species back


219
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:28,566
and also helping the government
to increase its enforcement


220
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:31,836
in this area because tigers and
their prey will never survive


221
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:32,946
without good enforcement.


222
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:37,596
And we're also working to
prepare the local people


223
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:40,496
for the prospect of
living next to one


224
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:42,276
of the world's great predators.


225
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:46,666
Interestingly, in our
conservation work with wildlife


226
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,366
as human populations grow
we have increasing conflict


227
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,136
with people.


228
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:55,386
It's happening all over the
world, but also interestingly


229
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,896
in Cambodia, there's
a lot of local support


230
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,816
for bringing tigers
back as it turns out.


231
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,786
Because tigers have
always been a popular part


232
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,726
of Cambodian culture
and natural history.


233
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:10,576
Well if all goes well the
government of Cambodia hopes


234
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:15,536
to get eight tigers from India
in 2019 for release to the wild.


235
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:20,236
It's a long and complicated
road ahead and it's not

without controversy or risk,
but if it happens it will be one


237
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,756
of the most exciting
developments I think


238
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:28,246
in wildlife conservation.


239
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:35,006
Well I'm happy to say that
rhinos are also recovering


240
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:36,366
in parts of their range.


241
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:39,406

actually are being established

prehistoric looking animals

new homes for them

where their numbers can grow.


245
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,976
And I want to show you a video
of a big idea that's playing


246
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:55,846
out in South Africa where
incredibly the safest way


247
00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:58,516
to physically move these
animals is to tranquilize them


248
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:02,776
and lift them up by
helicopter for transport by air


249
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:06,076

otherwise take many hours

But just for a larger context,
when I first went to Ranthambore


329
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:38,626
in India, the human
population of India was


330
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:39,886
about a billion people.


331
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:43,746
India is projected to add
another half billion people

00:21:57,886 --> 00:21:59,916
to this crowded new world.


337
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:03,316
So let me show you some of
the ways that we're using tech


338
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:08,396
in our work from new tracking
methods of wildlife using DNA


339
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:12,956
to detecting and deterring
poaching using thermal cameras


340
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:13,836
and drones.


341
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:19,376
So our work tracking
wildlife has come a long way.


342
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:23,916
We used to rely on pugmarks
to footprints or scat,


343
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:27,866
which are animal droppings
to count and monitor animals


344
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:31,286
and that was very laborious
and pretty imprecise.


345
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:36,886
So camera traps have become
kind of the mainstream way


346
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:39,966
of monitoring animals
in the natural habitat.


347
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:43,366
Camera traps are cameras set
up remotely that are triggered


348
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:46,836
by a motion sensor when an
animal crosses its path.


349
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:50,706
And these are especially useful
for species that are most active


350
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:56,146
at night like lions or species
that have distinctive markings


351
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:59,786
like a brown hyena where
you can identify individuals


352
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:02,276
by their markings and
the same with tigers.


353
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:07,066
In fact, the latest tiger
surveys have relied on thousands


354
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,776
and thousands of
images from camera traps


355
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:13,356
that are giving us the latest
tiger population trends.


356
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:16,776
And as cameras become lighter


357
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:21,606
and smaller they are
giving us a wonderful window


358
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:25,276
into what the world looks like
from an animal's perspective.


359
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:29,696
And videos like this help
us understand how species


360
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:31,406
like turtles are
using their habitat,


361
00:23:31,596 --> 00:23:34,376
which helps us understand
how to protect them better.


362
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,926
They are also great tools
for raising awareness.


363
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:40,986
This video has been viewed
by millions of people,


364
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:44,246
it's gone viral and it's been a
very popular one that's really


365
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:51,386
helped connect people to
turtles in a unique way.


366
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:55,186
And innovative uses of GPS
technology are helping us


367
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:59,196
to understand where wildlife
is going, their daily movements


368
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:00,716
and their seasonal migrations.


369
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:06,526
One of our scientists made
a cool discovery in 2012


370
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:10,116
by putting special
satellite collars


371
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,146
with the latest GPS
technology on a group


372
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:16,716
of eight zebras he discovered
that they moved from a part


373
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,486
of northern Namibia to
the middle of Botswana,


374
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,876
about 200 miles south.


375
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:26,306
And this turns out to be the
longest known terrestrial


376
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:29,396
migration in Africa and
it's amazing to think


377
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:32,286
that as recently as just
four years ago we didn't know


378
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,796
about the longest land
migration in Africa


379
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:37,336
and this technology
made that possible.


380
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:41,906
So here's an animation of the
zebras moving over the course


381
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:43,336
of about six or seven months.


382
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:47,276
Each colored dot represents
an individual zebra.


383
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,286
They start in this
northern part of Namibia


384
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:53,306
and they start moving south
as the wet season comes on.


385
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:55,406
You'll see the dark green
background indicating the wet


386
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:56,186
season is coming.


387
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:58,886
They move south pretty
quickly to a special place


388
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:02,046
where it turns out they eat a
very nutritious grass during the


389
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:02,696
wet season.


390
00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:07,366
They hang out there for about
10 weeks and then they kind


391
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,666
of start meandering
back up north


392
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,976
to the place from
where they came.


393
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,596
It takes them a little
longer to get back up,


394
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,296
but they finally end up back
when the dry season comes


395
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:20,226
to their preferred
habitat in Namibia.


396
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:24,066
And the importance of this
data is that we can now use it


397
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:27,866
to advocate for protecting
the species


398
00:25:28,406 --> 00:25:31,326
through its whole
migration corridor


399
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:33,876
and thus preserve the
lifecycle of the herd


400
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:35,286
in this particular area.


401
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:38,926
Well, one of the most
recent developments


402
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,776
that I'm most excited
about is the use


403
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:46,736
of thermal imaging cameras to
help identify poaching threats.


404
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:49,086
Thermal cameras are also known


405
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,946
as infrared cameras
detect the heat emitted


406
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:53,856
from a person or an animal.


407
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:56,366
And in a pilot we're undertaking


408
00:25:56,476 --> 00:26:00,406
in Africa we're pairing
these cameras with software


409
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:03,826
that is able to distinguish
an animal from a person.


410
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:07,386
So when a person crosses
into a park illegally


411
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:11,676
or inappropriately the software
automatically sends a signal


412
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:13,006
to enforcement authorities.


413
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:17,086
Since these cameras were
installed a few weeks ago,


414
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:20,886
they're put on poles actually
and they have a viewing range


415
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:24,236
of 2 miles, up to 2
miles, a huge range.


416
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:28,436
And since they were installed
they have detected several


417
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:30,586
intruders in this
particular area


418
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:33,316
and one suspected
poacher has been arrested.


419
00:26:33,316 --> 00:26:35,976
And let me show you the
video of the poacher


420
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:38,086
or suspected poacher
who was arrested.


421
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:40,796
You see him walking
along the fence line,


422
00:26:40,796 --> 00:26:42,446
which is the border of the park.


423
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:47,716
He's looking for a way to get
into the park inappropriately.


424
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:54,046
Finally finds a way, jumps
over and he's in the park.


425
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:57,916
And that red box around him
is what triggers the signal,


426
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:58,736
the alert that's sent


427
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:01,196
to enforcement authorities
who later nabbed him.


428
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:05,136
So if this technology
is successful,


429
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:08,446
if this pilot works we hope
to scale it to other areas


430
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,716
where we think it could
have a really good use


431
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,916
in perimeter security
around protected areas.


432
00:27:15,856 --> 00:27:20,476
Well remember I said earlier we
started our work years ago using


433
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:22,966
footprints as a way to track
animals and count them.


434
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:25,116
Well we're still
using footprints,


435
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:28,216
but these days we're
extracting DNA from them.


436
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:33,136
Through advances in DNA
technology an amazing amount


437
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:36,696
of information can be drawn
from a polar bear footprint


438
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:40,386
in the snow, including
the gender of the animal


439
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:44,026
and incredibly what it
had for its last meal.


440
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:47,826
So as we're working
with DNA experts


441
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:52,026
to refine this technology
and get the cost down.


442
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:53,416
But this has the potential


443
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,016
to revolutionize
how we track animals


444
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:58,916
in their natural habitats and
it's particularly useful --


445
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:01,966
it could be useful for species
like polar bears who live


446
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:05,096
in very extreme environments,
making them extremely difficult


447
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:07,266
to study and very
expensive to study.


448
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:12,446
So this is exciting as well.


449
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:16,756
Well, we've been hearing
a lot about drones


450
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:21,066
in so many different ways
and drones are a big part


451
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,236
of our work in conservation.


452
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,716
There's been a lot of
hype about them as well.


453
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,966
The challenge we have with
using drones in conservation is


454
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:33,446
to develop civilian level
systems of drones that have some


455
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,506
of the similar capabilities
as military drones,


456
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,966
but at a fraction of the cost,


457
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,836
otherwise they're just
never going to be used


458
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,886
by park managers and
conservationists.


459
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,116
So we're experimenting
with these different sort


460
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:48,476
of downscaled systems of
using different approaches


461
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,616
and for different needs.


462
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:53,806
For example, we're using
them to map colonies


463
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:56,386
of prairie dogs here
in United States.


464
00:28:57,366 --> 00:29:00,306
Prairie dogs happen to
be the main prey species


465
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:03,326
for the most endangered
mammal in North America,


466
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:05,856
which is the black-footed
ferrets.


467
00:29:06,436 --> 00:29:11,256
So by knowing where prairie dogs
live we know where ferrets live


468
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,746
or have the potential to live


469
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:16,366
so we can thus help better
develop recovery efforts


470
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:17,286
for them.


471
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:22,936
We're also using drones to
help identify poaching threats


472
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,896
and address poaching in Africa.


473
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:29,446
Well the challenge
we've had with drones is


474
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:33,696
that they are probably
best used and best function


475
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:38,276
as reactionary tools or
devices that are deployed


476
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,036
when another sensor is set
off somewhere else in the area


477
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,416
that the drones can
then help pinpoint


478
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,966
where potential illegal
activity is taking place.


479
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:52,036
In fact, drones because
right now the viewing


480
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:58,706
of the videos is not as broad
as it could be the range.


481
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:01,816
We are now working to
try to get those improved


482
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,966
so that more can be
seen from a drone.


483
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,736
We're also trying to
develop software much


484
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:10,356
like with the thermal cameras
that can help us identify people


485
00:30:10,506 --> 00:30:14,596
from animals and thus, send
alerts automatically to rangers.


486
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:16,986
So we're continuing to
evolve our work with drones


487
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:19,516
and they certainly have a
role to play in different ways


488
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:21,796
if we can get the
capabilities improved.


489
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:27,346
We're also continuing to think
of new ideas to help some


490
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:30,156
of our challenges and I wanted
to share a couple that are


491
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:31,696
in their early stages
of development.


492
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:37,036
These are wire snares, snares
are one of the greatest hazards


493
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:38,686
to wildlife everywhere.


494
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:41,026
Literally millions and
millions of them are used


495
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:45,376
around the world and they
are creating real havoc


496
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,646
for wildlife.


497
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,316
They're easy, unfortunately
they're inexpensive


498
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:54,396
and relatively easy to use
and we need to find a way


499
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,616
to detect them better, so
that rangers can collect them.


500
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,126
In fact, in one park in
Malawi last year just


501
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,976
to give you a sense of
how widely these are used.


502
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:07,486
Malawi is a country in Africa,
13,000 snares were collected


503
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:10,196
over an eight month period
and that probably wasn't all


504
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:11,586
that were in this
particular park.


505
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:14,506
So what we're doing is we're
experimenting with types


506
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:18,026
of radar to try to map where
snares are because they're made


507
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,576
of metal we can use
radar we hope.


508
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,786
Potentially positioned
from drones,


509
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,986
so that rangers can
more easily find them


510
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:26,056
and go out and collect them.


511
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:27,296
And if we can do this


512
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:31,346
in a cost-effective way it could
be a huge gain for wildlife.


513
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:36,226
Snares typically grab
an animal by its leg


514
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,156
and inflict a lot of injury.


515
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:41,626
Sometimes it'll grab them
by the neck like this zebra,


516
00:31:41,956 --> 00:31:44,326
fortunately the zebra
was able to survive,


517
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:48,286
but often species do not.


518
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:54,296
We're also working on a gunshot
detector to help pinpoint


519
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:56,166
where poaching is happening.


520
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,116
And we got the idea from
a tool called ShotSpotter,


521
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:03,256
which we actually read about
in the Washington Post.


522
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:07,636
ShotSpotter is used by police
departments to try to pinpoint


523
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:11,916
where gunshots are happening
in cities through audio sensors


524
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,216
that are placed on buildings.


525
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:17,106
We called up the Washington DC
Police Department who invited us


526
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:19,446
down to see ShotSpotter
in action.


527
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:23,666
We sat in the command center
looking at this big screen


528
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:26,736
as pins dropped in real time


529
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,216
as shots were going
off around the city.


530
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,366
It was quite a surreal
experience.


531
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:35,466
The challenge we have on
the wildlife front is,


532
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:38,466
where do you put
sensors, audio sensors,


533
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:40,286
in a vast national park?


534
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:43,236
No buildings there,
huge territory.


535
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:47,826
Well the idea that we're working
on is to place the detector


536
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:50,386
on a special collar
fitted on an elephant


537
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,336
that could help rangers
quickly come to an area


538
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,726
where maybe an animal
has been shot


539
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:58,546
and if it's only wounded they
may stand a better chance


540
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,726
of saving it than
they otherwise would


541
00:33:00,726 --> 00:33:05,646
and it could prevent
further killing of the herd.


542
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:08,496
Also it could be
a good deterrent


543
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:10,396
by simply seeing this device


544
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:14,676
on the elephant poachers
may stay away.


545
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:18,236
This could be a great
tool for conservation,


546
00:33:18,236 --> 00:33:20,986
but right now the costs
are a pretty significant


547
00:33:20,986 --> 00:33:21,956
limiting factor.


548
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:28,746
Well none of this really
promising technology can replace


549
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,276
people on the ground,
the rangers,


550
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,316
the enforcement officers,
the communities


551
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:37,756
who are really critical
to protecting wildlife.


552
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:41,376
In fact, it's often the people
who live closest to the wildlife


553
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,606
who are its greatest guardians.


554
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:47,176
I mentioned earlier
the country of Nepal


555
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:50,506
and its successful rhino
conservation efforts.


556
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:54,726
A lot of that success is due
to the direct involvement


557
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:56,926
of communities and conservation.


558
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:01,596
Nepal has achieved
a remarkable record.


559
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:09,235
In fact, in the last six
years, four of those years,


560
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,726
Nepal has had zero
poaching of rhinos.


561
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:15,386
This is an amazing
achievement at a time


562
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,786
when rhino poaching
is happening,


563
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,286
big rates everywhere
in the world.


564
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:23,476
The reason for this
is the involvement


565
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:25,755
of local communities, big
commitments from the government,


566
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:29,606
but particularly communities
have set up informer networks


567
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:34,235
that share critical tips
on illegal activities


568
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:36,406
and help track poaching


569
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:39,996
and illegal trading
activities in wildlife.


570
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:46,686
And in fact, one notorious rhino
smuggler was recently prosecuted


571
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:51,356
in Nepal after community
members collected information


572
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,346
and they banded together
to turn him in.


573
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:57,476
And he's now serving
a seven year sentence,


574
00:34:58,106 --> 00:35:01,066
which is a long sentence
for a wildlife crime.


575
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:08,086
In the country of Namibia all
the trends that you're seeing


576
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:12,696
across Africa have been bucked
in this country and that is due


577
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,976
to the involvement of
communities and conservation.


578
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:19,176
Namibia has actually seen
growth almost across the board


579
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:21,716
of its wildlife populations
in the last 20 years


580
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:26,436
and its elephant numbers have in
fact tripled since the 1990's.


581
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:30,256
At a time when unfortunately
numbers have plummeted


582
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:32,196
in most other countries
in Africa.


583
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:36,756
And this is because communities
are directly involved


584
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:39,076
in conservation as the
managers and stewards


585
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:40,116
of the wildlife there.


586
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:44,246
Legislation in Namibia
gives communities the right


587
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:47,396
and the responsibility to
manage wildlife resources


588
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,916
under their jurisdictions.


589
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:52,266
It also allows them
to benefit directly


590
00:35:52,456 --> 00:35:54,186
from the revenues associated


591
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:58,546
with wildlife related
activities like ecotourism.


592
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:02,176
This gives them a direct
incentive in and stake


593
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,086
in conservation and that
has made all the difference.


594
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:09,996
This is truly a model program
for both wildlife conservation


595
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:12,056
and world development
and in fact,


596
00:36:12,056 --> 00:36:13,906
a lot of countries
are looking to Namibia


597
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:17,426
to learn how they're doing it
so they can also adopt some


598
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:19,906
of these same practices.


599
00:36:20,126 --> 00:36:22,566
While communities of
another sort are helping us


600
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:26,566
to address the needed
reforms and policies in some


601
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:29,026
of the most important
wildlife consuming countries.


602
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:33,506
That letter that was up
there is called Chor Chang,


603
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:36,246
it is a letter in
the Thai alphabet.


604
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:40,426
It also happens to
be the first letter


605
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:45,336
for the word elephant in Thai.


606
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:48,376
We asked people in
Thailand, which happens


607
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:52,646
to be the world's second
largest market for ivory,


608
00:36:53,526 --> 00:36:57,786
to help raise awareness
about the illegal ivory trade


609
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:01,476
by trying to imagine a
world without elephants.


610
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:06,336
By symbolically erasing
the letter Chor Chang


611
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:07,186
from their names.


612
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:14,486
This campaign went viral, over
a million people participated.


613
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:18,656
They posted pictures
of their name online


614
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:22,076
without the letter Chor
Chang in it on Facebook,


615
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:23,506
on Twitter, on Instagram.


616
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:27,316
And result was huge public
pressure on the Thai government


617
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:29,676
to crack down on the
illegal ivory trade


618
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:33,926
and to reform its ivory
trade laws and they did.


619
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:35,496
It was a big success.


620
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:41,696
Just two weeks ago here in
this country our own federal


621
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:46,616
government announced a new
regulation, a final regulation


622
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,956
to ban almost all
commercial trade


623
00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:51,206
of ivory in the United States.


624
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:55,226
Something we've been working
on for more than three years.


625
00:37:57,256 --> 00:38:02,456
This regulation was
partly made real


626
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:05,716
by huge public outpouring
of support for it.


627
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,656
In fact, WWF was
able to generate more


628
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:11,436
than a million signatures
on an online petition,


629
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:13,476
which is the most the
governments ever received


630
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,146
from an organization
on a wildlife issue.


631
00:38:16,636 --> 00:38:20,686
And the significance of
this regulation is not only


632
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:24,316
because the U.S. is one of
the top five ivory markets


633
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:28,156
in the world, it has also
prompted similar action


634
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:32,206
in China, the world's
largest market for ivory.


635
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:36,436
In fact, one of our big
breakthroughs last year was a


636
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:40,726
joint commitment by President
Obama and President Xi of China


637
00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:44,206
to take action against
the illegal ivory trade


638
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:49,596
and we're beginning to see
that commitment implemented.


639
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,506
And I'm really happy to share


640
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:57,806
that just a week
ago China announced


641
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:01,846
at the U.S. China strategic
and economic dialogue talks


642
00:39:01,996 --> 00:39:05,456
in Beijing that they
will announce by the end


643
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:08,436
of this year a timetable
for shutting


644
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:10,456
down their domestic
ivory market.


645
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:14,546
This is a huge deal
for conservation.


646
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:18,006
If China makes good
on its commitment


647
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,106
and we will do everything we
can to ensure that they do,


648
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:25,086
it will be a game changer
for Africa's elephants.

650

So inspiring people to
actively participate


651
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:42,906
in conservation issues
is a really critical part


652
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:46,336
of our strategy at WWF.


653
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:48,856
And new technologies
are making this possible


654
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:50,936
in ways we never
dreamed of before.


655
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:57,826
We first entered the app world,
your world, three years ago


656
00:39:57,826 --> 00:40:00,936
with the launch of WWF Together.


657
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:04,646
On the iPad, it's now
also on the iPhone.


658
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:08,586
It's an app that
introduces people to animals

from around the world through
stunning visuals and video,

00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:03,516
We were thrilled to be
invited to this stage in 2012,


666
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:10,026
to accept the Apple
design award for this app.


667
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:12,366
Our work in close collaboration


668
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:18,656
with Apple actually started last
year with a conservation project


669
00:41:19,106 --> 00:41:24,196
in China to protect up to
a million acres of forest.


670
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:30,086
That important work led to an
initiative to engage hundreds

of millions of people through
the largest Earth Day promotion

00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:37,146
ever called Apps for Earth.


673
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:43,706
Hopefully many of you saw
this, well actually some


674
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:46,046
of you participated in
a very significant way


675
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:51,116
in this ten-day promotion
led by Apple in April.


676
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:58,346
Twenty four developers
created unique app contents


677
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:01,336
with conservation messages
about the importance


678
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:04,346
of conserving natural
resources and wildlife


679
00:42:04,806 --> 00:42:06,676
and finding solutions to some


680
00:42:06,676 --> 00:42:10,506
of the most pressing
threats to our planet.


681
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:16,336
People around the world could
play Angry Birds 2 and shoot


682
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:22,776
down greedy pigs who were
overfishing the ocean.


683
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:26,816
Or in Star Wars Galaxy of
Heroes buy a pack of Ewoks


684
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:32,396
to help save the
forest moon Endor.


685
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:35,326
Or challenge friends and
family at Trivia Crack


686
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:38,706
to test their knowledge of some
of the most important issues


687
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:41,756
of our time, such
as climate change.


688
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:44,676
We reached millions of people


689
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,846
with critical conservation
messages.


690
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:52,256
And we also raised critical
funding for conservation.


691
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:57,296
In fact, I am super excited to
be able to share with you today


692
00:42:58,496 --> 00:43:03,476
that Apps for Earth raised over
$8 million for conservation.


693

[ Applause ]


694
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:12,866
This is unprecedented, it's
a huge deal for conservation


695
00:43:12,866 --> 00:43:16,586
and this critical funding
will go to help advance some


696
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:19,436
of the initiatives you've heard
about today like doubling tigers


697
00:43:19,436 --> 00:43:22,506
in the wild and protecting
forest and saving coral reefs.


698
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:24,066
It's a huge deal.


699
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:28,336
We are so grateful to everyone
who participated and especially,


700
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:30,256
to Apple who made
it all possible.


701
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:35,496
If we can do this kind of thing
together just imagine what we


702
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:39,306
can do if we continue to
apply our most creative ideas


703
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:41,096
in support of conservation.


704
00:43:42,776 --> 00:43:46,316
We're making important progress,
but there's so much more to do.


705
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:52,356
To save everything we need
everyone and there are a lot


706
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:55,746
of critical challenges that the
tech industry can help with.


707
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:59,566
There's no question that
technology has a critical role


708
00:43:59,566 --> 00:44:01,986
to play in our vision
for saving the planet.


709
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:06,486
We need your help to
address the digital divide,


710
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:10,266
the lack of connectivity
in remote areas


711
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:13,206
where conservation happens,
which are often beyond the reach


712
00:44:13,206 --> 00:44:15,686
of the global system for
mobile communication.


713
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:20,596
And we need your help to develop
smaller, less expensive devices


714
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:24,546
with longer battery times so
that we can track all the users


715
00:44:24,986 --> 00:44:28,346
in a protected area, both
the animals and the people,


716
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:31,206
and transmit data in real time


717
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:33,466
to conservation scientists
and managers.


718
00:44:34,686 --> 00:44:36,756
And as the technology
of the Internet


719
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:38,426
of things develops
we need your help


720
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,656
to deploy it in conservation.


721
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:46,626
And we need your help to
find the most innovative ways


722
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:49,206
to reach people everywhere
with compelling stories


723
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:53,000
about conservation to get
them onboard with our mission.


724
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:01,506
Nature and all the wonderful
wildlife that is part


725
00:45:01,506 --> 00:45:08,256
of it is powerful and resilient
and it will respond and rebound


726
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:09,506
if given half a chance.


727
00:45:10,996 --> 00:45:17,226
Technology can help do that,
as can all of us in this room


728
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:19,936
when we share ideas
and work together.


729
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:23,876
And we at WWF look
forward to that.


730
00:45:25,176 --> 00:45:25,566
Thank you.
