### Teslameter ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This application implements a Teslameter, a magnetic field detector. It displays the raw x, y, and z magnetometer values, a plotted history of those values, and a computed magnitude (size or strength) of the magnetic field.

The use of the Core Location API for getting "heading" data is contained in the TeslameterViewController class. It creates a CLLocationManager object and uses it to get heading by invoking -[CLLocationManager startUpdatingHeading]. It implements the CLLocationManagerDelegate APIs for receiving heading and updates its user interface accordingly.

===========================================================================
BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

iOS SDK 4.0

===========================================================================
RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS:

iPhone OS 3.2 or later and iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4
Requires a device with a magnetometer. This sample will run in the Simulator but only one magnetic measurement will be received.

===========================================================================
PACKAGING LIST:

AppDelegate:

The application delegate, adds the main view to the window and displays the window.


TeslameterViewController:

A view controller that manages the primary view within the application. It creates a CLLocationManager and turns on heading updates. As updates are received, it displays them in a graph, x, y, and z labels, and also computes the magnitude (size or strength) of the magnetic vector. The units for all values are microteslas.


GraphView:

A custom view for plotting history of x, y, and z magnetic values.
