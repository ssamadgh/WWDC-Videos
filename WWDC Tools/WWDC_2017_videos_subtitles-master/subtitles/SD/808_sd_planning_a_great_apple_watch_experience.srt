00:00:22,516 --> 00:00:26,646
[ Applause ]


2
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:28,096
>> Good afternoon.


3
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,256
I'm Doug LeMoine.


4
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:33,246
And I'm a design evangelist here


5
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:33,826
at Apple.


6
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:35,436
I'll be joined in a bit by Jake


7
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:35,916
Behrens.


8
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:37,896
He and I have teamed up to work


9
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:39,316
with Apple Watch developers


10
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:40,766
around the world over the past


11
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:41,156
year.


12
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:42,826
Helping them make their Apple


13
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:44,386
Watch apps as awesome as


14
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:44,976
possible.


15
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:46,576
And we're here today to share


16
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:47,536
what we've learned.


17
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:51,056
You might be here because you've


18
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:52,716
been developing for Apple Watch


19
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:53,916
and you're looking for some


20
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,716
inspiration and ways to improve


21
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:56,126
your app.


22
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:58,276
Or you might be here because


23
00:00:58,276 --> 00:00:59,286
you're new to the platform.


24
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,296
Welcome. You saw Monday's


25
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:02,536
keynote, you heard about the


26
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,025
improvements, and now you're


27
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,146
ready to get started.


28
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,316
We've got tips, ideas and advice


29
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,826
that will be useful to you all.


30
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:12,076
I'm going to begin by talking


31
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:14,026
about planning, where to start.


32
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:15,556
Or, if you've already got an app


33
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:17,456
where to go next with your next


34
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:17,966
release.


35
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:19,756
I'm going to show practical


36
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:21,266
methods that you can use to


37
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,426
define a great Watch app.


38
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:26,316
And then Jake is going to talk


39
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:28,036
about the implementation of a


40
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:29,386
app on Apple Watch.


41
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,046
But what he's really going to


42
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,906
focus on is how you can learn


43
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:34,786
from building.


44
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,766
He's going to talk about how we


45
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,536
tested ideas and learned from


46
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:40,686
the people who use our app since


47
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:41,886
the initial launch of Apple


48
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:42,346
Watch.


49
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:44,886
OK, let's dive in.


50
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:48,076
So, believe it or not, it was


51
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:49,406
only 2 years ago that Apple


52
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:50,836
Watch was unveiled to the world


53
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:53,036
and since then capabilities have


54
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:54,546
increased with each hardware and


55
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:55,516
software release.


56
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:57,576
In the past year alone, the


57
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,746
power and performance have


58
00:01:58,746 --> 00:01:59,266
doubled.


59
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,836
And Apple Watch Series 2 extends


60
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:03,116
what you can do with the watch


61
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:04,816
with built-in GPS and water


62
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,356
resistance up to 50 meters.


63
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,466
This means it Watch apps can


64
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,376
track your workouts, when you go


65
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,006
for a bike, ride, or a swim, or


66
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:12,466
a run.


67
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:14,496
And some health and fitness apps


68
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:16,096
provide inspiration for the


69
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,126
platform as a whole.


70
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:18,066
So, I want to walk through a


71
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:18,916
couple of those.


72
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,886
Sweat, an app from Australia can


73
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,376
guide you through a variety of


74
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:25,556
different exercises.


75
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,606
So, these are 28-minute workouts


76
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:30,046
with literally dozens of


77
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:30,726
movements.


78
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,246
And each of them has a helpful


79
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:33,786
animation on the watch.


80
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:35,716
If you're not sure how to do a


81
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:37,066
particular movement, you can get


82
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,476
visual guidance right there.


83
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:42,456
Zepp helps you improve your


84
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,146
tennis swing by using a sensor


85
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:45,296
mounted on the racket.


86
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:46,106
You might've seen this in


87
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:47,006
Monday's keynote.


88
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,556
But it gives you immediate


89
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:50,346
feedback on your last serve in


90
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:52,376
this case so you can adjust for


91
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:53,066
the next one.


92
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:54,886
So, you can make a serve, look


93
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,326
at your wrist, you can see how


94
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:56,826
you did.


95
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:57,806
Pretty cool.


96
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:01,496
RunGo from Vancouver can give


97
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:03,516
you turn by turn directions on a


98
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,916
road or a trail run.


99
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,686
You simply load the route that


100
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,786
you want and go.


101
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,866
So, this is voiceover, which is


102
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:13,186
an accessibility feature.


103
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:14,726
And the audio can play through


104
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:16,306
the Watch speaker, or through


105
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:17,526
Bluetooth headphones that you


106
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,686
can connect directly to the


107
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:19,216
Watch.


108
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,766
So, what can we learn from the


109
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,676
success of apps like these?


110
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,926
Like I said, in the past year,


111
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:27,636
we've traveled around the world.


112
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,546
And we've seen successful watch


113
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:31,566
apps, we've seen that successful


114
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,696
watch app development begins


115
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:34,686
with planning.


116
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,536
Which sounds obvious I imagine.


117
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,286
But for Watch, the best way to


118
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,376
begin planning is to be ruthless


119
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,166
and focusing and to identify a


120
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,126
single feature.


121
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:48,206
A single job to do on Apple


122
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:48,606
Watch.


123
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:50,316
A single task to complete.


124
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,246
A single goal to achieve.


125
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,836
So, this could be an existing


126
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:56,186
feature from your iOS app, or it


127
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,766
could be something new that


128
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,876
makes sense on the wrist and


129
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,856
that supplements what you do on


130
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:02,216
iOS.


131
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:05,296
So, this is an app called Night


132
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,466
Sky, from the UK.


133
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:08,456
If I see something up in the


134
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,586
sky, I can use the Night Sky app


135
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,006
on Apple Watch to figure out


136
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:12,576
what it is.


137
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:15,236
In this case, it actually starts


138
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:17,526
with a notification that points


139
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:19,076
my way to the International


140
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:19,935
Space Station.


141
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,346
So, that's what the arrow is


142
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:22,766
there.


143
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:24,716
So, a simple feature like this


144
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:27,146
can provide a small, or even big


145
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:28,266
moment of delight.


146
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:32,606
Speaking of delight, I can also


147
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,296
see if a new cat toy has brought


148
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:36,726
any new cats to my yard.


149
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:39,916
This is Neko Atsume from Japan.


150
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:41,546
Let's see, are there any new


151
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:42,126
cats?


152
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,996
Oh, yeah. Look at that little


153
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:45,236
guy.


154
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:50,246
But to be honest I'm more of a


155
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:50,876
dog person.


156
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,836
But this is an awesome app.


157
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,976
So, what do these apps do well?


158
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,016
They focus.


159
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,686
They reduce the scope of what


160
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,696
they try to do down to one thing


161
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:02,036
that makes sense on the wrist.


162
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,806
Night Sky offers a way to answer


163
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,636
one question, what is that?


164
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,386
That's it.


165
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,706
Night Sky's iOS app does much,


166
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:12,346
much more.


167
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:13,636
Check out all the things you can


168
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:14,146
do here.


169
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:15,916
You can find constellations.


170
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,276
You can learn about stars.


171
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,796
You can spend minutes or even


172
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,296
hours in here exploring.


173
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,496
There are no menus in the watch


174
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:23,786
app.


175
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:25,106
There's no navigation at all,


176
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:25,446
really.


177
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,526
Other than the cosmic navigation


178
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:28,946
of course, that the app allows


179
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:29,556
you to do.


180
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:32,346
It's things like this, in my


181
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,576
opinion, that really show what


182
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:34,726
the platform can do.


183
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:36,896
So, once you have your feature


184
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,496
what do you do next?


185
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,046
We've got some guidelines for


186
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,146
extending the UI and the UX of


187
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,056
your app on the Watch platform.


188
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:50,226
All right, so the UI's of great


189
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,926
Apple Watch experiences, have


190
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,676
three characteristics or


191
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:54,466
qualities.


192
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,306
First, they're legible.


193
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:58,686
Meaning the text on the screen


194
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:00,226
is readable with sufficient


195
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:00,916
contrast.


196
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:03,666
I'm saying this like it's


197
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,126
revolutionary, but it's actually


198
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,746
really simple and it's really


199
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:08,196
key.


200
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,826
That's why it comes first.


201
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,866
The Watch comp that you design


202
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,156
might look awesome on your 5K


203
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:18,096
iMac, but you need to see how it


204
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,886
performs on the small screen of


205
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,036
the device itself.


206
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:21,766
Is it legible?


207
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:23,486
Can you read it in a glance?


208
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:25,016
In bright sunlight?


209
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:27,546
Great experiences, as we all


210
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,326
know, start with getting the


211
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:30,316
little things right.


212
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:32,536
So, make sure that the text and


213
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:34,596
graphics on your Watch face are


214
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,046
readable in the specific


215
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,586
conditions of watch use.


216
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,596
So, number 2, they're concise.


217
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:41,556
To the point.


218
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,556
Only the information that


219
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,376
matters, only the actions that


220
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:45,826
matter.


221
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:48,216
Watch experiences can be truly


222
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:51,506
powerful when the Watch app has


223
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,406
tightly defined what it's trying


224
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:55,356
to do, and then delivers it in a


225
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:57,186
form that the user can grasp in


226
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:57,806
a glance.


227
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:01,366
And finally, they're timely.


228
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:03,586
Get it?


229
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:04,716
[ Chuckles ]


230
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,476
Oh, man, I have to wait for


231
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,136
groans and uncomfortable coughs


232
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:10,596
to end.


233
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:13,136
In all seriousness, timely is


234
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:14,526
actually just the most direct


235
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:16,446
way of describing the Watch


236
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,216
being relevant in the moment.


237
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:19,956
Both in a temporal sense and in


238
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,126
a situational sense.


239
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:23,766
So, we're going to use this as a


240
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:25,236
checklist as we look through


241
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,846
some Apple Watch experiences.


242
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:28,496
And I'd encourage you to do the


243
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:31,226
same when you plan and design


244
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:31,906
your apps.


245
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:33,126
All right, let's look at an


246
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:33,726
example.


247
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:36,836
This is Lift.


248
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,736
It displays 3 simple elements on


249
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:40,296
the screen.


250
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,396
The type is big with good


251
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,336
contrast right.


252
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,976
Legible. The elements are


253
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:49,316
informative, action oriented and


254
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,786
optimized for one thing; request


255
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:52,166
lift.


256
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:57,216
Concise. Also, the relationship


257
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,676
between the elements is clear.


258
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:00,006
It's got my location.


259
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,706
There's a 1 minute waiting time.


260
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:04,276
It's timely.


261
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:05,906
And notice that Lift is keeping


262
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:07,596
the location area simple and


263
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:08,236
glanceable.


264
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,916
They're also doing things behind


265
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,696
the scenes to populate it with


266
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:12,836
things that users might


267
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:13,486
recognize.


268
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:15,676
Favorites, previous places, or


269
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:16,916
just well-known places.


270
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:19,526
Okay let's look at another


271
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:20,006
example.


272
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:21,586
This is Major League Baseball.


273
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,676
The team names are big, really


274
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:24,046
big.


275
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:26,316
For the most part legibility is


276
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:28,126
about size on Apple Watch.


277
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,546
If you wonder whether your type


278
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,026
is big enough, it probably


279
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:31,376
isn't.


280
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:34,206
When the primary information is


281
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:36,216
undeniably primary, you're


282
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,376
heading in the right direction.


283
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,356
The relevant details with Major


284
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,035
League Baseball are concise.


285
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,506
Today's pitchers and their


286
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:45,056
records.


287
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:46,366
And finally, it's showing me


288
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,656
only today's game.


289
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:52,176
Timely. All right, now I want to


290
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:53,546
talk about concise.


291
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:55,146
This is CBS News.


292
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,076
We're at the home view, which


293
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,386
shows headlines.


294
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,376
I can simply scroll through and


295
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:01,976
get caught up in a few seconds.


296
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:03,926
How many headlines does it show?


297
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,636
Usually around 8 to 10.


298
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,086
It seems like enough.


299
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:08,976
All right, let's drill in.


300
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,796
So, now we're in the article


301
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:12,146
view.


302
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,826
And once we get here, we can


303
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:15,066
quickly scan down through the


304
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,626
article using the digital crown.


305
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,446
And pretty quickly I get to the


306
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:20,146
bottom.


307
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:21,476
So, this is actually just a


308
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:22,336
synopsis.


309
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,016
And I can continue reading on my


310
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:24,596
iPhone.


311
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,586
Either by using Handoff or by


312
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:28,136
bookmarking it and saving it for


313
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:28,516
later.


314
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:30,956
All right, let's talk about what


315
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:31,846
they did well here.


316
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:33,646
Big, bright text.


317
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:37,666
Concise. It doesn't necessarily


318
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,096
mean fits on one screen.


319
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:41,236
It can simply mean one thing


320
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:42,556
that a person cares about.


321
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,236
So, even though this experience


322
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:46,106
involves scrolling headlines and


323
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:47,806
text it feels simple.


324
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,506
And finally, timely.


325
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:52,426
I have access to the latest news


326
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,976
in a super accessible form.


327
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,786
Okay, now that we talked about


328
00:09:57,786 --> 00:10:00,076
the UI of apps, I want to talk


329
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:01,196
about the other side of the


330
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:01,976
experience.


331
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:04,566
The person using your app.


332
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:05,856
And I'm going to get


333
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,806
aspirational about the kind of


334
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,486
experience that can be created


335
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,486
on Apple Watch.


336
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:16,246
On iPhone, we all know that apps


337
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,346
can help people get things done,


338
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:19,796
answer questions and achieve


339
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:20,346
goals.


340
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:22,716
The Watch, the goals are the


341
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:24,566
same, but the parameters of the


342
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:25,756
experience are different.


343
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:27,366
The screen is small.


344
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,696
So, the information needs to be


345
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,636
distributed in small chunks.


346
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:32,716
Just in time.


347
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,606
Great Watch experiences involve


348
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,996
apps doing work on behalf of


349
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:38,526
people.


350
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:40,456
Working in the background and


351
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,726
emerging at the right time to be


352
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,276
helpful.


353
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,766
Sort of like an expert.


354
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,266
Someone who's smart about stuff


355
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,256
that I care about and leaps in


356
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,786
to offer help when necessary.


357
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:54,306
Like an engineer or a scientist,


358
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,316
like mission control who helps


359
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:59,066
an astronaut navigate space, who


360
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:01,966
informs the astronaut when


361
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:03,846
decisions need to be made or


362
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:04,936
when new information is


363
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:05,516
available.


364
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:06,846
Information that helps


365
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:07,676
navigation.


366
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:09,586
The status of the spacecraft,


367
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,206
are the pod bay doors open.


368
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,056
Is it time to jump to hyper


369
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:13,506
speed.


370
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:17,216
This is how engineers behind the


371
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,416
scenes assist astronauts.


372
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,116
The scientist manages the flow


373
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:24,056
of information to the astronaut


374
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,866
and gets her the information she


375
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:28,066
needs just in time in a concise


376
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:28,936
and timely way.


377
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:33,696
So, the good news is being


378
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:36,276
helpful in this way is not


379
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:37,256
rocket science.


380
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,086
Sorry, about that.


381
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:41,966
Terrible joke.


382
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,356
Let's take WWDC as an example.


383
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:47,436
You spent the last 3 days,


384
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:49,276
surrounded by life forms.


385
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:50,686
You may know some of them.


386
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,296
Some of them may know you.


387
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,186
You may have connections that


388
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:55,546
neither of you even knew about.


389
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:57,756
The iPhone helps.


390
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:59,146
There are various ways of


391
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:00,776
organizing your life on iPhone;


392
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:03,076
contacts apps, social networks


393
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:03,776
and so on.


394
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:04,956
All of which are useful.


395
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,036
Apps like these typically


396
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:09,456
provide places that help people


397
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:11,986
begin looking for information.


398
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,436
Sometimes you want the


399
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:16,256
information to come to you.


400
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:17,696
You want these apps to be


401
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,456
proactive or predictive.


402
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:21,316
You want help remembering a


403
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:21,846
name.


404
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:24,166
Or help revealing a connection


405
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,286
or a common interest that you


406
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:25,926
might have.


407
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:29,576
My point here is that the magic


408
00:12:29,576 --> 00:12:31,316
and delight of Apple Watch


409
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,606
happens when your apps work on


410
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:36,316
behalf of your users to get them


411
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,796
the information they need in the


412
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:38,216
moment.


413
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,556
And by doing this and still


414
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:42,086
trust that they will continue to


415
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:43,286
do so in the future.


416
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:47,476
So, when your app is legible,


417
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,026
concise and timely your users


418
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,996
will feel a personal connection.


419
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:53,266
So, we're going to add a fourth


420
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,356
quality of great Apple Watch


421
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,506
experiences, personal.


422
00:12:58,256 --> 00:12:59,596
Being legible, concise and


423
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:02,066
timely establishes that personal


424
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,966
connection with each individual


425
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,996
who uses your app.


426
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:06,526
Knowing that they'll get the


427
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:08,566
information they need when they


428
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:10,006
need it.


429
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,006
Like an astronaut trust people


430
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:14,206
at mission control to pass along


431
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:15,636
the right information at the


432
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:17,426
right time, so that they can


433
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:18,786
stay focused on the mission.


434
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,046
OK, we're going to travel back


435
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:22,676
down to earth.


436
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:24,466
We're going to look at a quick


437
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:25,116
example.


438
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,376
Calendar. This is mission


439
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:29,406
control, right.


440
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,336
it's the big canvas.


441
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:34,326
Where you can survey the future,


442
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,696
see what's going on for the next


443
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:36,406
week or month.


444
00:13:36,786 --> 00:13:38,276
Here you've got all the dials


445
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:38,856
and levers.


446
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:41,616
You can create calendars, create


447
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:43,386
meetings, move stuff around,


448
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:45,096
tons of real estate, and tons of


449
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:45,726
tools.


450
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,206
As you move on the iPhone, the


451
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:49,056
view narrows.


452
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:49,956
It's just today.


453
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:52,016
Why? Well because this


454
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:54,056
accurately reflects the scope of


455
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,446
what you typically care about on


456
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:56,286
a mobile device.


457
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:57,556
You can still navigate through


458
00:13:57,556 --> 00:13:58,586
weeks and months, but you're


459
00:13:58,586 --> 00:13:59,996
focused on the near future.


460
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,316
Zooming in further, to the


461
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:02,766
wrist.


462
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:04,716
Apple Watch shows you the next


463
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:05,106
event.


464
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:07,006
You can scroll through events


465
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,606
over the day and into subsequent


466
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:08,986
days.


467
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,046
It's optimized for the next


468
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:12,616
thing.


469
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:13,836
Finally, the calendar


470
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:14,756
complication.


471
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,726
So, I can keep track of where I


472
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,476
need to be by simply glancing at


473
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,816
my wrist and seeing it right


474
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:20,926
there in the middle of my watch


475
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:21,346
face.


476
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:22,316
So, we've gone from mission


477
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,186
control to the mission.


478
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:25,836
All right.


479
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,176
So, I've shown some different


480
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:28,756
components of Apple Watch, now


481
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:30,356
let's walk through each one


482
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:31,016
quickly.


483
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,216
Each of these can be used to


484
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:35,856
deliver information to your


485
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:37,236
users on Apple Watch.


486
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:39,526
The three components of every


487
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,666
Watch experience.


488
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,806
And like they're shown here,


489
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:43,036
they're equally important.


490
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,876
Unlike other platforms, the app


491
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,986
is not necessarily the center of


492
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:49,586
an experience on Apple Watch.


493
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:51,916
There are complications which


494
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,876
are persistently displayed on


495
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:54,716
the Watch face.


496
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:56,516
They're a way for you to provide


497
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,326
ambient information or access to


498
00:14:58,326 --> 00:14:58,866
your app.


499
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,266
Notifications, which you're


500
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,716
probably already using on iOS,


501
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,016
and we'll talk about what's


502
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:05,376
different on Apple Watch.


503
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,306
And finally, the app itself.


504
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,576
Important of course, but not


505
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,386
necessarily more so than others.


506
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,786
So, let's start with the most


507
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:14,976
persistent element of the


508
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:15,746
experience.


509
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:16,746
The complication.


510
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:19,116
Information from your app on the


511
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:19,966
Watch face.


512
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:23,166
Complications are helpful when


513
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,876
they're continuously providing


514
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:26,926
value to users.


515
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:30,246
So, what persistently provides


516
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:31,176
value?


517
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:33,326
Well, being relevant.


518
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:36,036
Being predictive, offering a


519
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,186
peek into the future.


520
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:39,666
Showing progress.


521
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:42,416
Or, simply providing a launch


522
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:44,026
button for your app.


523
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:47,146
There are examples of each of


524
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,696
these on the Watch face.


525
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,006
CARROT weather is immediately


526
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:53,636
relevant to both here and now.


527
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,076
It shows me the temperature and


528
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:56,776
current atmospheric conditions.


529
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,646
Night Sky shows me that Neptune


530
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:00,186
is setting.


531
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:01,966
This is an upcoming thing that I


532
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:02,566
care about.


533
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,966
And then there's the calendar


534
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:05,596
complication, letting me know


535
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,846
what I've got coming up.


536
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:09,866
Finally, Nike Run Club shows me


537
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:10,856
the miles I've logged.


538
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:12,306
Incremental progress.


539
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:14,976
Now, as you saw on Monday, the


540
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:17,396
Siri face on watchOS4 brings


541
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:18,976
timely information to you from a


542
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:20,116
variety of places.


543
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,566
So, this face adapts, delivering


544
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,846
timely, concise information


545
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,586
rather than requiring people to


546
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,256
go and find it.


547
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,386
OK, so those are complications.


548
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:32,686
Let's talk about notifications.


549
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:35,636
On Apple Watch, notifications


550
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:37,086
briefly take over the UI


551
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,576
allowing people to fully engage


552
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:40,026
with them.


553
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,276
This means that from the point


554
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:43,946
of view of the person using your


555
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,996
app a notification from your app


556
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,866
is essentially your app.


557
00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:52,616
This notification can be styled


558
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:54,716
to look like you're app and it


559
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:55,956
can deliver information and


560
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:57,386
provide timey actions.


561
00:16:58,316 --> 00:16:59,596
So, let's look at an example.


562
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:02,736
Organizing a soccer game can be


563
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:03,486
complicated.


564
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:05,665
You've got to find a field.


565
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:06,876
It takes that a big open space


566
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:07,816
to play soccer.


567
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,215
You've got to find a time to


568
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:11,205
play, coordinating schedules can


569
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:12,205
be complicated.


570
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:14,165
You've got to find players.


571
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,695
If you want the game to be fun,


572
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:16,576
the players need to be of


573
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,156
roughly the same skill level.


574
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,165
And finally, you need to collect


575
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,306
fees, sometimes for the field or


576
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:23,945
facility.


577
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:26,726
So, this is an app called


578
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:27,566
Apitador.


579
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:28,816
It's from Brazil.


580
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,106
It answers the question where


581
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:32,876
and when can I play a pickup


582
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:33,546
soccer game.


583
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:34,896
So, it shows me a map.


584
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:37,386
Let's say I'm at the Apple


585
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:38,576
office in São Paulo.


586
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,296
There tons of games going on


587
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:40,796
around me.


588
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,246
So, I can create a profile for


589
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:45,196
myself in iOS, including the way


590
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,046
that I like to play.


591
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,116
So, let's be honest, I have no


592
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,676
place in a pickup soccer game in


593
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:50,136
Brazil.


594
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:51,696
But let's go ahead and create a


595
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:52,536
profile anyway.


596
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,556
As I start playing games, other


597
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:55,606
players can rate me.


598
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:56,826
Am I a good player?


599
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,406
Did I show up on time?


600
00:17:58,816 --> 00:17:59,596
Was I friendly?


601
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:02,486
People who are organizing games,


602
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:04,006
can see that and they can invite


603
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:05,706
me when they need a player like


604
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:07,056
me.


605
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,516
A "attacking midfielder" which


606
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:11,816
is I guess what I am.


607
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:13,566
So, when someone invites me to a


608
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:15,846
game, I can see this invitation


609
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:17,836
appear as a notification.


610
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,456
In this case, a person who is


611
00:18:19,456 --> 00:18:20,906
organizing a game has reached


612
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:21,446
out to me.


613
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:23,766
There's a game on Friday at 7pm.


614
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:25,276
So, I can swipe down in the


615
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,466
notification and see a quick map


616
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,006
of where the game is, not far


617
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:29,826
from the office.


618
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,186
And super helpful actions that I


619
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:33,666
can tap.


620
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:36,266
So, I can say, I'm in, or out,


621
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:38,286
or dismiss it.


622
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:40,896
So, let's quickly evaluate this.


623
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:44,066
Super readable, uses their brand


624
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,546
shade of green really well.


625
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:47,816
That's soccer green.


626
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:50,156
Very legible.


627
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:53,746
Super concise as well, all the


628
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:55,336
information is there in a swipe.


629
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:58,776
This is pickup soccer, which can


630
00:18:58,776 --> 00:18:59,956
be pretty spontaneous.


631
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:02,156
So, getting a notification about


632
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,786
a game that might happen soon is


633
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:04,796
also really helpful.


634
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,196
The fact that I can take


635
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:08,166
appropriate action directly from


636
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,456
the notification is pretty cool.


637
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,656
And receiving simple,


638
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:17,536
informative notifications from


639
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,306
an app that I trust about


640
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,026
something that I love doing


641
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,076
makes me feel pretty great.


642
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:24,946
It's pretty amazing to be able


643
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,536
to act immediately without


644
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:28,216
reaching into my pocket and


645
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:30,326
pulling out my phone to respond.


646
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:32,796
Pretty personal.


647
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,856
So, what I've really liked about


648
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,316
this is that they extended their


649
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,896
app to the wrist in a helpful


650
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:42,836
delightful way that made sense


651
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:44,576
for what they do, organize


652
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:45,366
soccer games.


653
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:51,886
I'm much more likely to continue


654
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,896
to engage with apps like this


655
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,086
when they reach out to me with


656
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:56,846
valuable information and give me


657
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:58,626
easy ways to take action or make


658
00:19:58,626 --> 00:19:59,366
decisions.


659
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:02,106
Okay, that's notifications.


660
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:04,266
Let's talk about apps.


661
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:05,536
So, the app as I said, isn't


662
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:06,786
necessarily the center of the


663
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:08,656
experience on Apple Watch, but


664
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:09,856
obviously, it's important to


665
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:11,756
consider what kind of experience


666
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:13,366
you can provide in it.


667
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,906
Notifications and complications


668
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:17,456
can feel proactive and


669
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:18,146
predictive.


670
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:20,016
Apps on the other hand are best


671
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,316
when they provide simple and


672
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,656
direct actions, or tools, or


673
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,436
information.


674
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,076
This is an app called Elk, it's


675
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:27,816
from Singapore.


676
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:29,866
It's a currency converter that


677
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,706
uses simple gestures in the


678
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,406
digital crown to quickly figure


679
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:35,086
out how expensive a thing is.


680
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,446
So, to be clear, the question


681
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,286
they're answering this how much


682
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:40,016
is this thing.


683
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:43,346
So, in this case, I'm in Canada,


684
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:46,636
I'm buying something, maple


685
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:47,046
syrup.


686
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:51,796
With a couple of swipes, there


687
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,666
we go, we can swipe out some


688
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,766
decimal places and a couple of


689
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:56,796
digital crowns.


690
00:20:56,996 --> 00:20:58,146
I can have increment it.


691
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:00,886
All right, one last tweak.


692
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:04,126
Is that right?


693
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:06,636
It seems kind of expensive for


694
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:07,456
maple syrup.


695
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,776
So, what did they do well?


696
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:11,356
Well, they've allowed me to


697
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,096
quickly calculate a price, and


698
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:14,796
they've also kept it discrete,


699
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:17,556
it saves me the embarrassment of


700
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:19,066
not knowing that this is how


701
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:19,906
much it costs.


702
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:21,656
It's very simple to do this with


703
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,286
a couple of gestures, and


704
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:24,196
they've also saved me some


705
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:24,536
money.


706
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,646
All right.


707
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:27,606
Let's evaluate it.


708
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:30,016
Big type, legible.


709
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:33,676
All on one screen, concise.


710
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:37,496
Helpful and discrete, timely.


711
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,236
Totally trustworthy and helps me


712
00:21:40,236 --> 00:21:42,016
solve a real-world problem.


713
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,546
Awesome. OK before I turn it


714
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,266
over to Jake, I'm going to take


715
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,226
you through a quick app planning


716
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,266
exercise where we will put to


717
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,936
use the things that we just saw.


718
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,496
So, we're going to plan an app,


719
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,006
from start to finish in just a


720
00:21:58,006 --> 00:21:58,896
couple of minutes.


721
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:03,016
Let's say Jake and I work for a


722
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:05,076
company called SailBoss.


723
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:08,056
Now, that Apple Watch Series 2


724
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,696
is water resistant with onboard


725
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,056
GPS, it seems like it's time to


726
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:14,056
bring our iOS app to Apple


727
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:14,606
Watch.


728
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:17,256
So, I open up Sketch and I grab


729
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:17,936
an art board.


730
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,476
Start thinking about what we


731
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:20,296
could bring over.


732
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,286
We worked on some cool graphs


733
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:24,036
and visualizations for the iOS


734
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:24,316
app.


735
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:27,256
It would really be a shame to


736
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:28,956
not bring them over to Watch.


737
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,566
This one shows wind with an


738
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:32,646
animated arrow.


739
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:33,846
It's pretty cool, right?


740
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,356
And this one shows swell.


741
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:37,806
This helps people understand


742
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:38,926
whether the conditions on the


743
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:40,296
water will be in their comfort


744
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:40,696
zone.


745
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,356
Finally, there's the temperature


746
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:44,276
of the air and water.


747
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:46,196
Obviously, there are plenty of


748
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:47,926
other metrics that determine


749
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:49,756
good sailing conditions; tides,


750
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:51,756
and seasons, and whether Neptune


751
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:53,676
is rising and setting, and so


752
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:53,916
on.


753
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,946
But at SailBoss we focused on


754
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:56,396
these.


755
00:22:56,796 --> 00:22:57,246
All right.


756
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,396
So, now we want to take these


757
00:22:58,396 --> 00:23:00,826
graphs into a Watch UI.


758
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:02,386
So, back to Sketch.


759
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:03,886
Let's see if we can represent


760
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,516
all the metrics that matter to


761
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:06,346
our users.


762
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:08,236
All right I need to adapt the


763
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,846
wind graphic a little bit to fit


764
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,286
it in.


765
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:11,876
So, I've strung it across the


766
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,076
top, because it's the most


767
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:13,666
important.


768
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:15,936
And here's the swell.


769
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:18,376
Wow, that's pretty small.


770
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:20,526
Then we'll put the air


771
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:22,056
temperature down at the bottom.


772
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:23,586
Can't really fit in the water


773
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:24,196
temperature.


774
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:26,916
Let's see how we did.


775
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,466
So, it's like an iOS app but


776
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:32,496
miniaturized.


777
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:34,786
All right.


778
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:36,876
I'm going to evaluate this


779
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:38,256
against the four qualities.


780
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,016
First of all, is it readable?


781
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:42,626
I guess it's actually possible


782
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:43,976
that it is readable in this room


783
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:45,116
on this massive screen.


784
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:47,806
But on the wrist, no way.


785
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,316
Not readable.


786
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,166
We tried. It's just not readable


787
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:51,786
on Watch.


788
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,046
Is it direct in answering the


789
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,876
question should I go sailing


790
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:56,306
today?


791
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,736
Graphs are nice and there's lots


792
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,456
of information, but there's no


793
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:02,006
way to glance at this and answer


794
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:02,746
the question.


795
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,846
So, no. Is it timely?


796
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,826
I mean technically, I have the


797
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:09,546
times listed across the top,


798
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:10,836
that doesn't count.


799
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,756
It doesn't make the information


800
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:13,956
itself timely.


801
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:16,956
And finally, personal.


802
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,686
In our little scenario, Jake and


803
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:21,606
I know a lot of information


804
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:24,446
about the users who use our app.


805
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:26,406
We know what their preferences


806
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:27,356
are for their sailing


807
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:29,016
conditions, but the UI is not


808
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,656
really making this clear at all.


809
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,586
Ok, back to the drawing board.


810
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,946
We could just allow a chart or


811
00:24:36,946 --> 00:24:38,696
graph to take over the entire


812
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:39,356
screen.


813
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:41,876
The wind seems like the primary


814
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:42,236
thing.


815
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:43,366
So, let's start there.


816
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,046
We can even add the title up in


817
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:48,176
the status bar, that would help


818
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,466
with overall clarity.


819
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:51,016
Okay, let's test this out on a


820
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:51,776
Watch screen.


821
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:53,836
Definitely more legible.


822
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:55,306
Also, concise.


823
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:56,706
Seems like it could be pretty


824
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,016
helpful to have on the wrist.


825
00:24:58,326 --> 00:24:59,496
You launch the app and see the


826
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:00,736
current wind conditions.


827
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,746
Actually, this gives me an idea.


828
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:06,116
This could be helpful on the


829
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:07,616
face of the Watch.


830
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,096
A sailing complication.


831
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:11,746
It'd be a nice way to glance at


832
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,716
the current wind conditions.


833
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:15,056
So, it's relevant.


834
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:16,916
It's information about the here


835
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:17,316
and now.


836
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:19,546
Persistent information that's


837
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:20,136
useful.


838
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,936
Now we're getting somewhere.


839
00:25:22,706 --> 00:25:24,796
Now, not all apps have something


840
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,556
like this, but I think this one


841
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:26,986
does.


842
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:28,616
All right let's go back into the


843
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:28,926
app.


844
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:32,186
We could include other graphs as


845
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:34,936
additional pages, we can put


846
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,136
some page dots in there.


847
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:37,916
And then bring the other graphs


848
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:38,226
in.


849
00:25:38,756 --> 00:25:40,596
With watchOS4, you can even


850
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,236
launch the app on the second


851
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:44,526
page, put the wind there and


852
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,126
that would mean temperature and


853
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:48,266
swell are both just one page


854
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:49,536
away from the most important


855
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:50,266
information.


856
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:51,556
I'll have to ask Jake about that


857
00:25:51,556 --> 00:25:52,996
one, but I kind of like that


858
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:53,396
idea.


859
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:57,406
Still, it's complete, but it's


860
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:58,486
not concise.


861
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,016
It would take much longer than a


862
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,856
glance to see whether conditions


863
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,676
were favorable.


864
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:03,936
And you'd have to be swiping


865
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,926
back and forth, and tracking the


866
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:06,526
time.


867
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,666
We could highlight the type


868
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:09,796
range when conditions are


869
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:10,886
favorable, right?


870
00:26:12,356 --> 00:26:13,966
So, let's imagine that this is a


871
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,996
user's preferences announced as


872
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:18,766
a primary visual element in the


873
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:19,366
graphs.


874
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,176
It seems like it's getting


875
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:23,146
closer to being personal, but


876
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:24,156
it's still not great.


877
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:25,506
You still have to do too much


878
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:26,806
swiping back and forth and


879
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:27,966
figuring out whether those


880
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:30,546
highlighted areas are going to


881
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,746
match up.


882
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:34,236
So, let's think about another


883
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:35,976
element of the Watch platform,


884
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:36,986
notifications.


885
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:37,936
I think they could actually be


886
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:38,986
pretty helpful here.


887
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:41,596
I think we could actually create


888
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:43,116
a pretty awesome experience with


889
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:44,846
these given that we know about


890
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:45,976
the conditions that people


891
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:46,566
prefer.


892
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,186
We could fire off a notification


893
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:51,436
when the wind, and temperature


894
00:26:51,436 --> 00:26:53,346
and swell all got into the


895
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,516
comfort zone of a person using


896
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:55,916
our app.


897
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:57,996
No need to launch the Watch app


898
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:59,636
and swipe from page to page.


899
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:02,376
People can trust that SailBoss


900
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:03,496
will let them know when


901
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,636
conditions are awesome.


902
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:07,056
In fact, we could even include


903
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,366
some graphics to show that the


904
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:09,806
wind is in their comfort zone,


905
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:12,856
highlighted and vivid SailBoss


906
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:13,366
green.


907
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:15,986
And we could provide actions.


908
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,706
Simple stuff that could help us


909
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:19,486
tune future notifications.


910
00:27:19,926 --> 00:27:21,026
This would help us learn more


911
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:23,206
about each person who taps each


912
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:24,846
one of these actions, and


913
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:26,926
therefore provide even more


914
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:28,456
personalized information to them


915
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:29,086
in the future.


916
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:35,106
Ok. In this example, we focused


917
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,336
on a single feature.


918
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:37,436
A single question.


919
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:39,026
And we've arrived at what I


920
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,776
think is a decent hypothesis for


921
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:41,666
what we should build.


922
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,486
This is what I mean by planning


923
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:45,726
for Apple Watch, clearly


924
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:48,036
defining how your app will take


925
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:49,886
advantage of the small screen,


926
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,276
the context of use, and the


927
00:27:52,276 --> 00:27:54,266
Apple Watch platform components.


928
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:57,376
But, too much of anything is


929
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:58,006
unhealthy.


930
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:00,936
You need to know how this lands


931
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,396
with the people who you're your


932
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:02,636
app.


933
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:04,886
You need to see how people use,


934
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,966
or don't use your feature.


935
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,006
What they love and what they


936
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:08,356
don't.


937
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:10,096
So, I'm going to turn it over to


938
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:11,906
Jake to walk you through a


939
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,036
real-life example of what we've


940
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:15,196
learned over the past three


941
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:17,456
versions of the WWDC app.


942
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:25,166
[ Applause ]


943
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,326
>> Thank you, Doug.


944
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,386
My name is Jake Behrens, and I'm


945
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:30,836
the Apple Watch Technologies


946
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:31,606
Evangelist.


947
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,736
Now, as well as being an


948
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:36,126
evangelist, I'm also an engineer


949
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:38,566
on the WWDC App.


950
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,636
At Apple we're pretty secretive


951
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,536
about our development process.


952
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:46,126
But today I want to do something


953
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:46,616
different.


954
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,496
I want to pull back that curtain


955
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:51,036
and I want to give you a


956
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:53,506
behind-the-scenes look at how we


957
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:56,226
developed the WWDC app on


958
00:28:56,226 --> 00:28:57,076
watchOS.


959
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,516
Version by version, over the


960
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:01,246
last three years.


961
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,736
Now, I want to share with you


962
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:06,656
our experiences and our missteps


963
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:07,466
along the way.


964
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,376
In doing this, I'm hoping to


965
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:12,536
impart some things for you to


966
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:15,016
gain insight on and areas for


967
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:17,306
you to stay mindful of as you


968
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,606
develop your own Watch apps.


969
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,806
Maybe you have a great app


970
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:23,206
that's doing well in the store.


971
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:25,216
Or maybe you're just starting to


972
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:26,466
think of creating one.


973
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:29,016
Either way, I think you'll come


974
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:29,916
away with something.


975
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:34,646
So, our current app is optimized


976
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:37,986
for watchOS 3.2, but to give you


977
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,866
the full scope of where we've


978
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,366
been and how we got here, we


979
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,856
need to step all the way back.


980
00:29:44,476 --> 00:29:46,756
All the way back to watchOS 1.


981
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,916
And the app that we created for


982
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:49,463
it.


983
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:52,626
Now, when watchOS 1 was


984
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:56,846
released, well WWDC 2015 was


985
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:57,976
right around the corner.


986
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:00,636
And we were already preparing


987
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:02,586
the iOS app for that year.


988
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:04,836
Now, this app would let you


989
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,946
browse the schedule, add


990
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,286
favorite sessions.


991
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:10,686
Look at the maps to the venue,


992
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:12,936
read news throughout the week,


993
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:16,146
and view streaming videos, or


994
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,926
videos from previous years.


995
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:20,586
But, now it was time for us to


996
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,496
decide what contextually made


997
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:23,576
sense for the wrist.


998
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,536
So, we had these 4 areas.


999
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:30,706
First we had schedule, and the


1000
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,126
schedule was a no-brainer.


1001
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:34,146
That was the most crucial piece


1002
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,386
of information that we could


1003
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:37,806
provide at a glance to somebody


1004
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:38,776
on the go.


1005
00:30:39,736 --> 00:30:42,726
Next, we had maps.


1006
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:43,926
Maps not so much.


1007
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,706
When you're at the actual


1008
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:47,236
conference, the venue is


1009
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,666
typically one building with


1010
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,286
multiple floors and different


1011
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:52,266
rooms everywhere.


1012
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:54,146
And to get through that


1013
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,306
experience on Apple Watch, well


1014
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:57,396
we felt that that was best


1015
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:59,036
served through the iOS app.


1016
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,666
And really, honestly, if you're


1017
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,456
staring that iOS app at the


1018
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:04,176
conference, you could also look


1019
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:06,016
up into the real world and see


1020
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:07,046
the signs around you.


1021
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:08,556
I know it's farfetched.


1022
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,206
But you can.


1023
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:13,306
Then, we had news.


1024
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:15,426
And for the time being we


1025
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:16,916
thought that news made sense.


1026
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,846
We have critical information


1027
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:19,746
that we shared throughout the


1028
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:21,626
week, and so we wanted to make


1029
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,236
sure that somebody had access to


1030
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:23,986
that quickly.


1031
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:26,556
More on that in a bit.


1032
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:28,696
Finally, we had videos.


1033
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:31,206
And videos, we cut right away.


1034
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,086
It just didn't seem to make


1035
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:34,876
sense to have that long form


1036
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:36,296
video on your wrist.


1037
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:38,116
Could you imagine holding your


1038
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:39,856
wrist for 40 to 60 minutes.


1039
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:42,326
The arm gets a lot more beefier


1040
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:42,936
than the other.


1041
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:46,806
So, we have these key areas.


1042
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:48,726
So, let's look at the original


1043
00:31:48,726 --> 00:31:50,926
Photoshop mockup that we made


1044
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:52,166
for Watch app.


1045
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:53,856
You can see here that we


1046
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,276
actually took the schedule and


1047
00:31:55,276 --> 00:31:56,896
we broke it down into three


1048
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:57,856
distinct areas.


1049
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:00,246
We had sessions, labs and


1050
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:00,966
favorites.


1051
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,446
And we also had the news.


1052
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:05,456
Now, why did we break the


1053
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,366
schedule part?


1054
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:08,486
Well, there was a lot of


1055
00:32:08,486 --> 00:32:10,056
information to get across.


1056
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:11,576
I mean at the beginning of the


1057
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:13,726
week, you'd have over 100


1058
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:16,166
sessions, and over 100 labs.


1059
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:17,886
And we wanted to make sure that


1060
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:19,126
someone could get around


1061
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:20,896
exploring all of that content


1062
00:32:20,896 --> 00:32:22,216
really easily and quickly.


1063
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:25,736
Now, full disclosure here.


1064
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:28,266
This should've sent up huge red


1065
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:30,206
flags that we were putting way


1066
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:31,596
too much information into the


1067
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,946
Watch app experience.


1068
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:34,916
We were trying to break apart


1069
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,646
all this content so that you


1070
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:38,206
could get in and out.


1071
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:40,686
Well we'll talk more about this.


1072
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,396
I mean, I can definitely


1073
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:44,396
sympathize that when you first


1074
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,576
start creating apps for watchOS,


1075
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,686
it's a whole different ballgame.


1076
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:50,236
You're used to creating these


1077
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:52,496
deep, reach experiences for iOS


1078
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,636
and you start stripping things


1079
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,306
away for a great Watch app


1080
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:58,066
experience, but then you start


1081
00:32:58,066 --> 00:32:59,676
feeling like you're stripping


1082
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:00,606
too much away.


1083
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,266
And it's getting too minimal.


1084
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:04,886
And you start feeling that maybe


1085
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,996
you should add more features to


1086
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:10,066
add "value" to that experience.


1087
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:11,716
And we've learned over time that


1088
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:13,196
that's just not the case.


1089
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:15,086
But when you first start out,


1090
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:17,096
that's a tricky scenario to get


1091
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:17,546
into.


1092
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,766
So, we also had news.


1093
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:22,116
Let's talk about that.


1094
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:25,676
With news, we found taking that


1095
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:27,826
plan and actually implementing


1096
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:30,196
it and walking around for a week


1097
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:32,366
with it on our wrist, that you


1098
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:34,426
had these news items, but the


1099
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:35,806
items were a bit long.


1100
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,066
So, we couldn't have just one


1101
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,426
gigantic list of them.


1102
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:40,496
So, we actually needed to tap on


1103
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,306
news, get to a list of news


1104
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:44,276
items, then you tap on one, and


1105
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:46,456
go into the details, where then


1106
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,626
you had all this text that you


1107
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,546
would scroll through.


1108
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,206
And just the whole process of


1109
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:51,726
going in that navigation


1110
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:53,546
structure and back out to get to


1111
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:54,796
your sessions, it was just


1112
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:55,796
taking too long.


1113
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:58,126
So, we actually decided before


1114
00:33:58,126 --> 00:33:59,626
release to even cut that out.


1115
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:03,636
So, here's what we actually


1116
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:06,086
shipped for watchOS 1.


1117
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:08,755
We shipped the sessions, labs


1118
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:09,746
and favorites.


1119
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:13,186
Now if I were Doug right now I


1120
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:15,255
would say is this legible?


1121
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:17,766
Yes. Is it concise?


1122
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,426
Well, it wasn't as concise as it


1123
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:21,156
could have been.


1124
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:23,266
So, we needed to learn from that


1125
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:24,016
experience.


1126
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,516
Now, we had some built-in


1127
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:28,996
analytics to see where people


1128
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:31,045
were landing and what area of


1129
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:32,646
the app that they really valued


1130
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,636
to make it really personal for


1131
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:34,746
them.


1132
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,916
And we found that they loved


1133
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,356
this list of favorites.


1134
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:41,045
Even from this list, we had


1135
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:42,315
where you could tap on one of


1136
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:43,996
these favorites and then it


1137
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:45,096
would give you more detailed


1138
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,786
information; like the session


1139
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:47,485
description.


1140
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,315
And you could use the force


1141
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:50,826
touch menu to favorite or


1142
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:52,085
unfavorite a session.


1143
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:55,585
But, what we found was that that


1144
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:58,286
process was taking too long, and


1145
00:34:58,606 --> 00:35:00,136
not a lot of people were using


1146
00:35:00,136 --> 00:35:00,376
this.


1147
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:02,616
They were all using that list


1148
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:04,056
right in the middle, because it


1149
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:05,706
was the things they cared about


1150
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:07,156
and it was really quick to


1151
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:07,886
glance at.


1152
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:11,256
I mean we now know, as of


1153
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:13,996
watchOS 3 that really great


1154
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,926
tasks on Apple Watch take about


1155
00:35:16,926 --> 00:35:18,046
2 seconds.


1156
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:20,766
And for a non-nervous,


1157
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:22,516
non-jittery person it takes


1158
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:24,966
about 2 seconds to say 2


1159
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:25,726
seconds.


1160
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:29,416
But, this whole process of going


1161
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:30,936
down the navigation stack and


1162
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:33,156
coming back up, it was actually


1163
00:35:33,156 --> 00:35:35,156
taking more like 5 seconds.


1164
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,756
And that was just too long of an


1165
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:37,576
experience.


1166
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:41,176
So, what did we learn?


1167
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,836
Well, watchOS 1 taught us that


1168
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:45,816
we really needed to identify


1169
00:35:45,816 --> 00:35:47,286
what was most essential.


1170
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,676
Find that single feature.


1171
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,246
That one thing that you can


1172
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:54,176
provide for the person.


1173
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:56,176
All right.


1174
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:59,386
So, we moved from watchOS 1 and


1175
00:35:59,386 --> 00:35:59,956
we learned.


1176
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:01,646
And we went to watchOS 2 the


1177
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:02,326
next year.


1178
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:05,086
And we needed to do one key


1179
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:06,496
thing in watchOS 2.


1180
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:08,706
We needed to focus.


1181
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:10,146
Seriously.


1182
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,736
We really needed to focus on the


1183
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:13,636
feature set.


1184
00:36:13,936 --> 00:36:16,366
We needed to focus on the person


1185
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:17,636
and what they wanted.


1186
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,426
We needed to hone in on those


1187
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:22,226
principles that Doug has spoken


1188
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:22,616
about.


1189
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:24,366
And we needed to re-ask


1190
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:26,636
ourselves, what do people really


1191
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,716
want on their wrist.


1192
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,916
But not just anyone.


1193
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:33,616
What do people really want from


1194
00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:36,086
the WWDC app on their wrist.


1195
00:36:36,386 --> 00:36:37,986
What is the one thing?


1196
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,576
That one piece of information


1197
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:40,786
that we can provide them?


1198
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:45,026
Well, we knew from feedback that


1199
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:46,966
they really loved the glance in


1200
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:49,156
watchOS 1 because it showed them


1201
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:52,056
this concise view of what was


1202
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:52,836
right now.


1203
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,546
What was upcoming.


1204
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:57,326
And they really liked that.


1205
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,696
So, we knew that we needed to


1206
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:01,346
provide the schedule in some


1207
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,796
sort of way, right.


1208
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:04,836
So, we looked at what we were


1209
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:05,626
offering here.


1210
00:37:05,716 --> 00:37:06,826
We had sessions.


1211
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:08,576
We had labs, and we had


1212
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:09,306
favorites.


1213
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:12,126
Well, as I said it was a lot of


1214
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,806
content if you wanted to


1215
00:37:13,806 --> 00:37:14,666
explore.


1216
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:17,816
So, we decided maybe we should


1217
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:19,736
just take sessions and labs out.


1218
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:22,446
Maybe we should go all the way


1219
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:25,066
and just make it very, very


1220
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:27,226
personal of an experience and


1221
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:28,946
really focus on favorites.


1222
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,106
We had this master detail


1223
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,666
navigation structure and so we


1224
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,566
looked at it spread out, and we


1225
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,056
just said, well this seems


1226
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:39,856
pretty straightforward.


1227
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:40,936
We're going to take this


1228
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:42,506
navigation structure and just


1229
00:37:42,546 --> 00:37:43,596
condense it down.


1230
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:46,516
Get that list of favorites that


1231
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:47,396
everyone wanted.


1232
00:37:48,796 --> 00:37:50,116
So, this is what we shipped for


1233
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:50,996
watchOS 2.


1234
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:54,446
We went down to only favorites.


1235
00:37:54,696 --> 00:37:56,846
And now, not only did we go down


1236
00:37:56,846 --> 00:37:57,626
to favorites.


1237
00:37:57,886 --> 00:37:59,906
We also made it so that it was


1238
00:37:59,906 --> 00:38:02,556
only favorites from now until


1239
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:03,766
the end of the conference.


1240
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:05,676
So, this was something that we


1241
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:07,886
don't even provide in the iOS


1242
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:08,116
app.


1243
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:10,666
This is a feature that is only


1244
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,206
on Apple Watch, right.


1245
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,276
On iOS you can actually look at


1246
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:15,716
your previous favorites from the


1247
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:17,276
week, because you can get that


1248
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:18,236
rich experience.


1249
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:19,286
You can explore.


1250
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,666
But on the Watch, it really


1251
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,666
makes more sense to just have


1252
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,056
what's now and what's coming.


1253
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,326
Another thing to note here is a


1254
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:31,206
small detail.


1255
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:34,086
In watchOS 1, our table section


1256
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:35,926
headers above sessions, were


1257
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:37,636
dates, and time ranges.


1258
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:39,386
Not very glanceable.


1259
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:42,126
So, what we did was we actually


1260
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:44,076
made this more legible.


1261
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:47,136
It's amazing what one word, the


1262
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,536
placement of one word can do for


1263
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,886
your apps experience.


1264
00:38:51,316 --> 00:38:53,446
You can see here that we used


1265
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:56,466
words like now and upcoming to


1266
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,976
show you what was actually going


1267
00:38:58,976 --> 00:38:59,416
on.


1268
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,856
You could quickly glance at the


1269
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:04,006
app and know, oh okay, I can't


1270
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,696
go for coffee right now because


1271
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:06,696
I'm actually supposed to be in


1272
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:07,656
this other session.


1273
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,796
Later, I don't have one upcoming


1274
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:11,866
until further out, so I can go.


1275
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:14,816
It's these small details that


1276
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:16,626
add to that personal experience.


1277
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:21,636
Now, in watchOS 2, we took full


1278
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:23,386
advantage of complications,


1279
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:24,986
which were introduced in watchOS


1280
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:25,256
2.


1281
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:26,816
That timeliness.


1282
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:29,616
And if people wanted to have


1283
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:30,876
their favorites on their Watch


1284
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:32,776
face, they could enable the


1285
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:34,706
large slot on the modular Watch


1286
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,396
face and take advantage of that.


1287
00:39:37,036 --> 00:39:38,686
But we also wanted them to be


1288
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:40,596
able to get to our content no


1289
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:42,446
matter what kind of Watch face


1290
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,036
they used.


1291
00:39:43,526 --> 00:39:45,736
And we went through a lot of


1292
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:48,356
struggle of like, do we provide


1293
00:39:48,546 --> 00:39:49,876
something that just launches


1294
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:51,726
them to our app, or what can we


1295
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:53,456
provide in these smaller areas.


1296
00:39:53,486 --> 00:39:55,146
And really when it came down to


1297
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:56,856
it, we found that with the


1298
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:58,046
information that we had, there


1299
00:39:58,046 --> 00:39:59,186
wasn't anything that was


1300
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:00,766
amazingly valuable in that


1301
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,616
constrained, confined amount of


1302
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:02,976
space.


1303
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:05,356
And so, we actually went ahead


1304
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:06,886
and used launchers.


1305
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,606
But we made some custom ones for


1306
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,316
the different slot styles, so


1307
00:40:10,546 --> 00:40:12,366
that you know it blended in a


1308
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:13,676
little bit more nicely with the


1309
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:16,186
experience, and we did this for


1310
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:17,126
two reasons.


1311
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:18,846
The first reason I spoke about


1312
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:20,446
was that preference factor,


1313
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:21,606
right.


1314
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:22,986
What if they use a different


1315
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:24,026
kind of watch face?


1316
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:26,436
We want to allow them to do that


1317
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:28,146
and still have quick access to


1318
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:28,866
the content.


1319
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:31,416
But, we did this for a second


1320
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:32,386
reason as well.


1321
00:40:33,296 --> 00:40:34,556
App discovery.


1322
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:38,596
If you only support one or a few


1323
00:40:38,596 --> 00:40:40,656
type of complication styles,


1324
00:40:41,276 --> 00:40:43,326
then if they use a different


1325
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:45,226
type of Watch face, say utility,


1326
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:47,436
and we don't supply any of those


1327
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:49,876
types of utility slots of


1328
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:51,536
complications, when they go to


1329
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,376
configure their Watch face, they


1330
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:55,036
won't even see our app name.


1331
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,326
And so, they may think, well I


1332
00:40:57,326 --> 00:40:58,246
guess they just don't have a


1333
00:40:58,246 --> 00:40:59,136
complication.


1334
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:00,396
So, we wanted to be


1335
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:01,286
discoverable.


1336
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:03,556
And fit in to how they use Apple


1337
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:04,166
Watch.


1338
00:41:05,346 --> 00:41:07,666
So, as I said, we provided


1339
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,386
launchers because this really is


1340
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:10,106
constrained.


1341
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,826
You want to talk constrained, 36


1342
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:14,876
x 36 pixels for this one.


1343
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,576
Right? If you want to sound


1344
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,526
super fancy, you can say 18


1345
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:20,286
points by 18 points at 2x,


1346
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:21,626
because it's a retina screen,


1347
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:22,886
but.


1348
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,696
Here for watchOS 2 what did we


1349
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:27,066
learn?


1350
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,556
Well, we learned that you really


1351
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,886
need to focus your feature set.


1352
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:32,366
Really look at what you're


1353
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,736
providing and hone in on what


1354
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:36,756
means the most.


1355
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:39,346
What's that one thing?


1356
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,616
Okay, so now we go to watchOS 2


1357
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:46,446
to watchOS 3, and where our app


1358
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:47,306
currently is.


1359
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:50,106
So, if you look at the current


1360
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:51,736
app, you may even have it right


1361
00:41:51,736 --> 00:41:54,386
now, it doesn't look a whole lot


1362
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:54,836
different.


1363
00:41:54,836 --> 00:41:56,216
Actually, if you look at it side


1364
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,396
by side with watchOS 2, you'll


1365
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:00,016
notice we didn't change the


1366
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:00,856
design at all.


1367
00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:02,716
And that's because we found


1368
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:04,026
something that was working


1369
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:06,356
really well, that was applying


1370
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:07,386
these principles.


1371
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:09,666
But that doesn't mean that we


1372
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:10,556
just left it.


1373
00:42:11,176 --> 00:42:12,796
We moved it to the current


1374
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,306
version of the OS so that we


1375
00:42:14,306 --> 00:42:16,446
could take advantage of what


1376
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:17,816
that offers.


1377
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:20,086
Staying current and staying


1378
00:42:20,086 --> 00:42:21,826
state-of-the-art, is just as


1379
00:42:21,826 --> 00:42:23,636
important as adding new


1380
00:42:23,636 --> 00:42:24,326
features.


1381
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:25,996
You don't need to add new


1382
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:27,816
features just to add them.


1383
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:30,526
So, what we did was, we added


1384
00:42:30,526 --> 00:42:32,036
support for the extra-large


1385
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:33,376
complication that was now


1386
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:34,826
offered in watchOS 3.


1387
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,246
And it's funny, when I put this


1388
00:42:37,246 --> 00:42:38,786
in the build, there was a person


1389
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:40,776
in my team, and they first saw


1390
00:42:40,776 --> 00:42:41,746
it and they're like oh, this is


1391
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:42,656
really cool.


1392
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:43,806
And they were really excited and


1393
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:45,526
they're like yeah, WWDC is


1394
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:47,106
coming up I can put it all on my


1395
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:47,956
Watch face.


1396
00:42:48,326 --> 00:42:49,516
I was like great.


1397
00:42:50,606 --> 00:42:51,126
That was me.


1398
00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:55,846
But the point is that it adhered


1399
00:42:55,846 --> 00:42:57,866
to whatever your preference is.


1400
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,226
Whatever you want that


1401
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:00,786
experience to be, you can still


1402
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,636
get into that content quickly


1403
00:43:02,636 --> 00:43:03,416
and easily.


1404
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:06,016
Another thing that we did was,


1405
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,316
we made use of background app


1406
00:43:08,316 --> 00:43:10,046
refresh, which was introduced in


1407
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:10,916
watchOS 3.


1408
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:13,076
So, that if you added our app


1409
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:14,966
into the dock, or if you had it


1410
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:17,396
set as an active complication on


1411
00:43:17,396 --> 00:43:19,226
your active Watch face, it would


1412
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:20,916
follow you through the day,


1413
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:22,626
updating the schedule and the


1414
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,286
time, so that when you went to


1415
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:25,746
the app for more information, it


1416
00:43:25,746 --> 00:43:27,176
was already up to date.


1417
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:29,136
And it already should be.


1418
00:43:30,326 --> 00:43:34,436
Timely. So, even though we've


1419
00:43:34,436 --> 00:43:37,396
only had the app out for about


1420
00:43:37,396 --> 00:43:39,626
two weeks, we've already learned


1421
00:43:39,896 --> 00:43:41,996
that keeping what works is


1422
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:42,916
really important.


1423
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:44,306
It's very valuable.


1424
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:45,976
Like I said just moving to the


1425
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:49,386
current platform in OS and


1426
00:43:49,386 --> 00:43:51,386
taking advantage of it is just


1427
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:52,106
as important.


1428
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,356
Now, you may think that this is


1429
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:56,766
where we end, right?


1430
00:43:56,766 --> 00:43:57,646
This is our journey.


1431
00:43:57,746 --> 00:43:59,716
We're on watchOS 3, we're done.


1432
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:02,506
But, as I said I want to do


1433
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:03,716
something different, and I want


1434
00:44:03,716 --> 00:44:05,136
to go through this planning


1435
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:06,976
exercise and this thought.


1436
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,356
So, let's actually look into the


1437
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:09,966
future.


1438
00:44:10,546 --> 00:44:12,116
With the announcement this week


1439
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,246
of watchOS 4, we're excited as


1440
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:15,536
well to use some of the new


1441
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:16,326
enhancements.


1442
00:44:16,836 --> 00:44:18,126
But, we really need to answer


1443
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:20,326
that question can we make this


1444
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:20,756
better?


1445
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:22,526
Can we make the app experience


1446
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:24,686
even more concise, or even more


1447
00:44:24,686 --> 00:44:26,196
legible than before.


1448
00:44:26,566 --> 00:44:28,366
And I actually think we can.


1449
00:44:28,556 --> 00:44:29,716
I've been kicking around some


1450
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:30,256
ideas.


1451
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,756
Doug hasn't really paid too much


1452
00:44:32,756 --> 00:44:34,786
attention to them, but we'll get


1453
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:35,226
there.


1454
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:37,366
So, this is our current app on


1455
00:44:37,366 --> 00:44:38,326
watchOS 3.


1456
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:40,416
And one thing that I'd like to


1457
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,576
do is sometimes when you have a


1458
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:43,986
session title that's pretty


1459
00:44:43,986 --> 00:44:46,576
long, it actually almost takes


1460
00:44:46,576 --> 00:44:48,036
up the entire screen.


1461
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:50,326
Well, what if we just used the


1462
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:52,196
entire screen per session.


1463
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:53,946
What if we were able to bump up


1464
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:55,356
the text size to make it more


1465
00:44:55,356 --> 00:44:55,976
legible.


1466
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,596
Make it more concise so that it


1467
00:44:57,596 --> 00:44:59,736
is only one session at a time.


1468
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,736
So, this is kind of what I put


1469
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:03,986
together so far.


1470
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:06,296
And I found that we can actually


1471
00:45:06,296 --> 00:45:07,666
make use of the new vertical


1472
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,046
pagination introduced in watchOS


1473
00:45:10,046 --> 00:45:10,476
4.


1474
00:45:10,906 --> 00:45:12,346
And in the new vertical


1475
00:45:12,346 --> 00:45:14,426
pagination, you don't have to


1476
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:16,366
have a master detail navigation


1477
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:16,946
structure.


1478
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:19,176
You can actually just have those


1479
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,256
pages as the core part of your


1480
00:45:21,946 --> 00:45:22,026
app.


1481
00:45:22,026 --> 00:45:24,386
And so, by doing this, we can


1482
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:26,606
increase the text size, so that


1483
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:28,986
we can use the full screen per


1484
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:29,676
session.


1485
00:45:30,036 --> 00:45:31,396
And allow the design to breathe


1486
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,256
a little bit.


1487
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,216
Also, we can add in the track


1488
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:34,596
name.


1489
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:37,496
And then, we can take those


1490
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:39,436
table session headers and we can


1491
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,396
move those up into the status


1492
00:45:41,466 --> 00:45:41,766
bar.


1493
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,656
And so, we can still have that


1494
00:45:43,656 --> 00:45:46,956
experience of now, upcoming,


1495
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,256
tomorrow.


1496
00:45:48,256 --> 00:45:51,316
I think that this is something


1497
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,526
that could actually work.


1498
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:57,756
So, this also gives us something


1499
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:58,166
else.


1500
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:01,356
By going to this, we can improve


1501
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:02,316
Handoff.


1502
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,596
We currently support Handoff,


1503
00:46:04,866 --> 00:46:06,636
but as the current app is a list


1504
00:46:06,636 --> 00:46:08,196
of favorites, when you use


1505
00:46:08,196 --> 00:46:10,006
Handoff, you arrive in an iOS


1506
00:46:10,006 --> 00:46:12,196
app at the list of favorites.


1507
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,616
And that's pretty good, but I


1508
00:46:14,616 --> 00:46:15,856
think that we can now take that


1509
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,476
a step further by focusing on


1510
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,626
one session per page, we can


1511
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:23,466
actually change the information


1512
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:26,066
per page that handoff uses and


1513
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:27,666
get you directly into the


1514
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:28,296
session.


1515
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:30,106
So, that right when you swipe up


1516
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:31,796
from your lock screen, you can


1517
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:33,396
get into the app, you can tap


1518
00:46:33,396 --> 00:46:35,206
the play button, and bam, you're


1519
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,136
right in the video.


1520
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:37,396
I think that would be a lot


1521
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:38,626
smoother of a process.


1522
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:41,706
So, like I said, we'll have to


1523
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:42,066
see.


1524
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:43,416
We're going to keep looking at


1525
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:44,536
things and iterating.


1526
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:46,866
It's funny because even when we


1527
00:46:46,866 --> 00:46:49,266
were planning this session, Doug


1528
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,276
and I, we were texting back and


1529
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:52,676
forth, and we were saying, you


1530
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,806
know, do we actually need the


1531
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:55,976
favorites for tomorrow.


1532
00:46:55,976 --> 00:46:57,546
Does that really make sense?


1533
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,256
And we have kind of gone back


1534
00:46:59,256 --> 00:47:00,796
and forth on it of like how


1535
00:47:00,796 --> 00:47:01,926
valuable that would be.


1536
00:47:01,926 --> 00:47:02,976
Or if it should be like a


1537
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:05,106
rolling 24-hour window or


1538
00:47:05,106 --> 00:47:05,976
something like that.


1539
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:08,226
I mean we're still continuing to


1540
00:47:08,256 --> 00:47:09,576
iterate, just like you do on


1541
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,216
your apps.


1542
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,866
So, you know, we'll see where we


1543
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:14,116
land for next year.


1544
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:18,286
Now, we went version by version,


1545
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,816
but there are somethings that


1546
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:22,046
are evergreen on Apple Watch.


1547
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:25,086
Take for instance, notification.


1548
00:47:25,616 --> 00:47:27,626
Notifications are one of the


1549
00:47:27,626 --> 00:47:30,486
greatest pieces of Apple Watch.


1550
00:47:30,486 --> 00:47:32,146
I mean definitely for me when


1551
00:47:32,146 --> 00:47:33,956
people ask me why I love Apple


1552
00:47:33,956 --> 00:47:35,716
Watch so much, that's usually


1553
00:47:35,716 --> 00:47:37,706
the one thing that I rave about.


1554
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:39,396
It's like you get these


1555
00:47:39,396 --> 00:47:41,646
notifications, and they're


1556
00:47:41,646 --> 00:47:43,216
information coming to you.


1557
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:44,306
It's personal.


1558
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:45,796
It's relevant.


1559
00:47:45,886 --> 00:47:46,896
It's contextual.


1560
00:47:47,186 --> 00:47:48,066
It's amazing.


1561
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:51,916
So, we have notifications like


1562
00:47:51,976 --> 00:47:52,326
these.


1563
00:47:52,326 --> 00:47:54,066
Take for instance CARROT weather


1564
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:54,926
in the US.


1565
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:57,626
I set up in the app to get


1566
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,956
tomorrow's forecast every night


1567
00:47:59,956 --> 00:48:01,036
at 9 PM.


1568
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:03,616
And what I get is the app sends


1569
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:05,206
a notification based on my


1570
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:07,256
location and it takes over the


1571
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:10,156
screen and shows me in a very


1572
00:48:10,326 --> 00:48:12,846
beautiful format the high, the


1573
00:48:12,846 --> 00:48:15,086
low, possible precipitation for


1574
00:48:15,086 --> 00:48:15,676
tomorrow.


1575
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:17,786
And all I have to do is glance


1576
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:19,596
at that, and then I know when I


1577
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,066
wake up the next morning how I


1578
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:21,776
need to dress.


1579
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:23,046
How I need to prepare for my


1580
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:23,376
day.


1581
00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:24,886
This is just coming to me.


1582
00:48:25,176 --> 00:48:26,656
It's wonderful.


1583
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:29,816
Now, a lot of notifications that


1584
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:31,986
I get, they look like this.


1585
00:48:32,426 --> 00:48:35,326
This is the default.


1586
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:37,386
Now the default looks nice and


1587
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:39,866
all but also look at this text.


1588
00:48:40,196 --> 00:48:41,646
It says check out the latest


1589
00:48:41,646 --> 00:48:42,356
news update.


1590
00:48:42,946 --> 00:48:44,336
Well, that's not very helpful.


1591
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:45,976
Now I have to go to the app and


1592
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:47,436
check out the news update.


1593
00:48:47,696 --> 00:48:49,676
OK is it relevant to me, I don't


1594
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,086
know.


1595
00:48:50,086 --> 00:48:53,466
I guess. But with only about


1596
00:48:53,466 --> 00:48:55,976
four minutes worth of work, what


1597
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,456
you can do is you can open your


1598
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:59,266
storyboard in your project.


1599
00:48:59,556 --> 00:49:01,946
You can use the colors of your


1600
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:03,656
app and apply those.


1601
00:49:04,176 --> 00:49:06,236
And you can apply them like this


1602
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:09,456
to your apps name, to the sash,


1603
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:11,246
to the background.


1604
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,056
You can use spacing, textiles.


1605
00:49:14,366 --> 00:49:15,626
Make it more legible.


1606
00:49:15,716 --> 00:49:16,746
Make it more visually


1607
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,546
interesting.


1608
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:19,286
You'll also notice here that


1609
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:20,276
there's more text.


1610
00:49:20,276 --> 00:49:21,466
So that right when I get the


1611
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:24,006
notification, I know what it's


1612
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:24,536
about.


1613
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:27,816
Now, pay attention here, because


1614
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:29,806
this text for the notification


1615
00:49:30,006 --> 00:49:31,736
is actually custom written for


1616
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:32,836
the notifications.


1617
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:34,326
Just for the notification


1618
00:49:34,326 --> 00:49:34,856
payload.


1619
00:49:35,276 --> 00:49:37,056
Now, the news in the app could


1620
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:38,936
be longer, include more detail.


1621
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:40,096
But this is the gist.


1622
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:42,306
This is the important piece of


1623
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:43,686
relevant information that we


1624
00:49:43,686 --> 00:49:44,856
want you to see.


1625
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:46,886
Four minutes.


1626
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:48,066
I'm telling you.


1627
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,216
If we work our way backwards, we


1628
00:49:51,216 --> 00:49:52,396
can see the short look


1629
00:49:52,396 --> 00:49:53,306
notification.


1630
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:55,366
Now, this is what displays on


1631
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:57,036
Apple Watch, right when you feel


1632
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,376
that haptic and raise your


1633
00:49:58,376 --> 00:49:59,656
wrist, when a notification


1634
00:49:59,656 --> 00:50:00,286
arrives.


1635
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:02,656
It has your app icon, bit and


1636
00:50:02,656 --> 00:50:02,976
beautiful.


1637
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:04,946
And it has your app name.


1638
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,926
Now, notice the app name is in


1639
00:50:06,926 --> 00:50:07,176
white.


1640
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:10,146
Again, this is the default.


1641
00:50:10,486 --> 00:50:12,996
But with one line of code in


1642
00:50:12,996 --> 00:50:15,056
your payload, you can use the


1643
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:17,566
title key value pair and what


1644
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:19,396
this allows you to do is provide


1645
00:50:19,396 --> 00:50:21,146
some more context as to what


1646
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:23,296
this notification is about.


1647
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:26,106
And so, what happens is this is


1648
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,166
what it will look like.


1649
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:28,716
When it arrives on your wrist,


1650
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:30,246
it will have your beautiful


1651
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:33,176
icon, but it will also have that


1652
00:50:33,276 --> 00:50:35,446
title string between the icon


1653
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:36,606
and your app's name.


1654
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:39,836
And so, immediately, I can see


1655
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:40,956
is this relevant to my


1656
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:41,776
interests.


1657
00:50:41,986 --> 00:50:43,596
Can I look at this later?


1658
00:50:43,696 --> 00:50:45,186
Maybe I'm playing with my kids,


1659
00:50:45,186 --> 00:50:46,816
or I'm in a meeting, right?


1660
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:48,786
And the other thing that you'll


1661
00:50:48,786 --> 00:50:50,886
notice is that the app name is


1662
00:50:50,886 --> 00:50:52,836
in the primary tint color for


1663
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:53,386
the app.


1664
00:50:53,776 --> 00:50:56,086
So, it takes on more visual


1665
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:59,566
sensibilities of your app.


1666
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,786
So, truly four minutes and one


1667
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:05,046
line of additional text, can


1668
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:06,536
take you from default


1669
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:09,776
notifications, to much more


1670
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:13,166
relevant, contextual, visually


1671
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,016
interesting notifications.


1672
00:51:16,926 --> 00:51:19,646
OK, so we've spoken about a lot


1673
00:51:19,646 --> 00:51:22,206
today and planning is key.


1674
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:24,476
Really think about that process


1675
00:51:24,476 --> 00:51:26,376
of planning and designing your


1676
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:27,206
Watch apps.


1677
00:51:27,556 --> 00:51:29,616
I'm telling you this process


1678
00:51:29,616 --> 00:51:31,666
should actually be the majority


1679
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:34,386
of the entire development cycle


1680
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:35,386
for your Watch app.


1681
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:37,876
The implementation will be a lot


1682
00:51:37,876 --> 00:51:39,416
smaller timeframe.


1683
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,386
Then all the planning and design


1684
00:51:41,386 --> 00:51:42,536
to really make a great


1685
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:43,336
experience.


1686
00:51:44,696 --> 00:51:47,036
Also. try to start simple.


1687
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:48,996
You can see, even we made that


1688
00:51:48,996 --> 00:51:49,566
mistake.


1689
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:50,836
We thought we were starting


1690
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:53,206
simple, but we still had more


1691
00:51:53,206 --> 00:51:54,756
that we could do to make it


1692
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:56,226
concise, to make it more


1693
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:56,906
personal.


1694
00:51:57,186 --> 00:51:58,286
Think about that in your own


1695
00:51:59,226 --> 00:51:59,366
apps.


1696
00:52:00,236 --> 00:52:03,516
Finally, iterate, refine.


1697
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:06,506
When the OS moves up to another


1698
00:52:06,506 --> 00:52:08,616
version, take advantage of what


1699
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:10,616
you can, but don't feel like you


1700
00:52:10,616 --> 00:52:12,576
need to completely reinvent your


1701
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:14,696

00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:15,296

00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:20,136

1705
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:22,556

1708
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:26,556
