00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:31,426
>> Hi everybody.


4
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:33,136
Welcome to our session


5
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,546
on Expanded Subscriptions
in iTunes Connect.


6
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,836
My name is Daniel Miao and
I'm the engineering manager


7
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:39,706
on iTunes Connect.


8
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,146
So, we're going to
start this session off


9
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:45,326
by doing a quick review of
in-app purchases in general.


10
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,846
And then we're going to
move into the details


11
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:50,546
of how we're enhancing auto
renewable subscriptions


12
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:54,356
specifically in iTunes
Connect and in the system.


13
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,876
So, we've received a
lot of feedback from you


14
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,766
around how we can
improve auto-renewables


15
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:02,156
to better fit your businesses.


16
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:06,016
So, we're very excited because
today we get to take you


17
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,136
through new features that
will give you better control


18
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:10,156
over your pricing.


19
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:13,026
Help you to retain
your loyal customers.


20
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:16,946
And give you and your
customers more flexible tools


21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,256
for managing your subscriptions.


22
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,876
So, let's start with
the most basic question.


23
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:24,776
What is an in-app purchase.


24
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:29,266
Well, an in-app purchase
is simply digital content


25
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:32,606
or service that your customer
buys from within your app.


26
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:37,366
Now contrast with your customer
downloading your app off the app


27
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:40,996
store and receiving all
of that content up front.


28
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:45,476
Now, there are many ways
to use in-app purchases.


29
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:48,486
But, generally in-app
purchases are great if you want


30
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,386
to give your customers
the opportunity


31
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:54,346
to get an understanding of your
app offering before purchasing


32
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,916
add-ons to that offering.


33
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,766
Also, if you have a
subscription model for your app,


34
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,906
in-app purchases are
also a great fit.


35
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:08,406
And there are a number of in-app
purchase types available to you.


36
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,636
We have consumables,
non-consumables,


37
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:15,766
non-renewable subscriptions, and
auto-renewable subscriptions.


38
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:19,036
Today we also have
free subscriptions.


39
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,346
But, free subscriptions will
be deprecated this fall.


40
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:25,556
So, for those of you who have
free subscriptions today,


41
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,556
you can continue using them.


42
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:30,266
But, you will not be
able to create new ones.


43
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:34,146
So, let's go through
each of these types.


44
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:36,726
First, we have consumables.


45
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,736
Consumable is an in-app purchase


46
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:41,316
that your customers
purchase once per use.


47
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,546
Here we have an example
of a simulation game


48
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,976
on the app store,
Fallout Shelter.


49
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:47,216
It's a great game.


50
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,216
And the way Fallout
Shelter uses consumables is


51
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:54,396
to give you the opportunity
to buy in game items.


52
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:57,666
You use real money
to buy in game items.


53
00:02:58,226 --> 00:02:59,366
Add them to your inventory.


54
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:02,156
And once you've used them
up you go back into the game


55
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:03,876
and you purchase more.


56
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:09,256
Next we have non-consumables.


57
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:12,006
The non-consumables
is in-app purchase


58
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:15,096
that your customer buys
once and uses indefinitely.


59
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,256
In this example we
have Weirdwood Manor.


60
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,746
This is an interactive
storybook app.


61
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,926
When you purchase this
app you get the first book


62
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:26,746
in the series with the download.


63
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:31,206
If you enjoy this book you're
able to buy additional books


64
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:35,936
from inside of the app either
individually or as a collection.


65
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,146
Once you've unlocked these
books they're yours for good.


66
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:44,596
Next we have non-renewable
subscriptions.


67
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:48,506
A non-renewable subscription
is one that is purchased once


68
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,916
and available for
a limited time.


69
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:56,206
In this case we have Quizlet,
which is a study tools app.


70
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:59,286
And this app comes with many
great features out of the box.


71
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:04,386
But, if you'd like more features
Quizlet also offers a Quizlet


72
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,376
Plus service.


73
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:11,126
You subscribe to Quizlet Plus
for one year by paying $14.99.


74
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,566
And after that year if you'd


75
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:15,736
like to continue using the
Plus services you'd pay


76
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:16,935
for an additional year.


77
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:21,805
And finally we have
auto-renewable subscriptions.


78
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:25,206
And auto-renewable is
exactly the way it sounds.


79
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:27,156
It's a subscription
that you purchase


80
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:31,956
and it's renewed automatically
at regular intervals.


81
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,006
Here we have HBO Now, which
is a video streaming app.


82
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:39,746
HBO Now offers a subscription,


83
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,676
a monthly subscription
for $14.99 a month.


84
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,686
So, you purchase this
subscription initially


85
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,526
for $14.99 and each month
it automatically renews,


86
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,876
and you're charged $14.99.


87
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,706
And if at some point you want
to stop your subscription,


88
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:56,946
you go into you manuals
subscriptions page


89
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,976
in your account settings and
you turn off the renewal option.


90
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,806
Okay. So, it says here a few


91
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:05,206
of the different types
of in-app purchases.


92
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:08,416
Now, let's move into
talking about the changes


93
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,606
that are coming specifically
to auto-renewables.


94
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:13,906
Let's start by talking
about proceeds.


95
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:17,736
So, those of you who have
auto-renewables today are aware


96
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:22,326
that up until last week you
were receiving 70% proceeds


97
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,376
for any new subscriptions


98
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:27,166
to your auto-renewables
or renewals.


99
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:30,556
This is the same for
apps and the same


100
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,976
for other in-app purchase types.


101
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:38,596
But, beginning this week,
you'll be receiving 85% proceeds


102
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:42,696
from any customers that haven't
subscribed for one year or more.


103
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:48,966
[ Applause ]


104
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,286
The best part about
this is you don't have


105
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,866
to wait a whole year
before you see the 85%.


106
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:56,516
For those of you who
have existing customers,


107
00:05:57,406 --> 00:06:00,986
you'll start receiving
85% proceeds on renewals


108
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,076
for any customers that have been
already subscribed to your app


109
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:08,006
for a year or more beginning
with renewals this week.


110
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:14,686
[ Applause ]


111
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:15,426
All right.


112
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:16,996
Next let's talk about
app categories.


113
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:21,486
Today if you want to create an
auto-renewable subscription your


114
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:24,676
app has to belong inside a
set of limited categories.


115
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:29,386
Well, we've seen a lot of
successful businesses grow


116
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,676
around auto-renewables
over the past few years.


117
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:35,216
And we've seen these businesses
deliver excellent products


118
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:37,336
to customers that the
customers really love.


119
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:41,906
Additionally many of you have
been coming to us asking to open


120
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:44,286
up auto-renewables to
your app categories.


121
00:06:45,886 --> 00:06:49,986
So, we're very happy
because beginning this fall


122
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,696
if your app makes sense
for auto-renewables,


123
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:57,366
categories will no
longer be a limitation.


124

[ Applause ]


125
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,496
So, those are some
of the policy changes


126
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:07,016
that are coming to
auto-renewables.


127
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:09,916
Now, let's talk about some
of the feature changes.


128
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,936
We'll start with how the
customer experience will


129
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:14,766
be evolving.


130
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:18,096
Here we have a subscription
management page


131
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:21,106
on your customer's device
that they see when they go


132
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:24,826
into the app store, go into
their account details and tap


133
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,256
into manage subscriptions.


134
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:31,076
These are all the subscriptions,
auto-renewable subscriptions


135
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,716
that your customer's
currently on.


136
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,866
If we take a look at one of
these you'll notice a lot


137
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,006
of metadata here that you're
probably familiar with.


138
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,306
We have an app icon.


139
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:44,526
We have an app name.


140
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:48,026
And incidentally you can
override this app name


141
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:50,626
in iTunes Connect for
this specific view.


142
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:52,936
You might want to override this


143
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:56,336
if possibly your app name
is over 30 characters.


144
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,806
In which case it'll be truncated
in manage subscriptions,


145
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:03,506
or if your service name doesn't
quite match your app name.


146
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,466
Next we have the name of
the subscription group


147
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,366
that this subscription is in.


148
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:13,486
This will show up if you have
more than one group on your app.


149
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:18,026
And finally we have the name
of the subscription itself


150
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:19,646
as well as the duration.


151
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,256
Now, if your customer
wants to manage one


152
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,626
of these subscription,
they simply tap into this


153
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,826
and they'll see this view.


154
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:32,635
Here we see the customer's
current subscription along


155
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:35,326
with renewal options
for the subscription.


156
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:38,535
These renewal options are
simply other subscriptions


157
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,826
in the same subscription group
as the customer's current one.


158
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:47,036
In a subscription group
it's just a collection


159
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:51,196
of subscriptions that
describe your app offering.


160
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:55,906
Now, as your customer moves


161
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:59,436
between subscriptions they
can only have one active


162
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,126
subscription per group.


163
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,296
So, for example, if they went


164
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,006
from the full course
subscription here


165
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:08,296
to the entree only,
once entree only goes


166
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:11,526
into effect full
course will stop.


167
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:16,606
Next, if your customers
jump between subscriptions


168
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:22,666
in a group regularly, that will
not affect your 85% proceeds.


169
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,746
That means that as long
as the customer stays


170
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:28,426
within this group you'll
continue to accrue days towards


171
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:31,606
that year that you need
to start receiving 85%


172
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:32,826
from this customer.


173
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:37,346
As part of this feature
said, we're also going


174
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:40,386
to be adding the
ability to designate,


175
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:41,876
upgrade, and downgrade paths.


176
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,456
And upgraded goes into
effect immediately.


177
00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,486
So, in this case if
we've designated as,


178
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:53,216
if we've designated entree only
to full course as an upgrade,


179
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:58,006
the switch to full course
would happen once the customer


180
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:58,586
selects it.


181
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:03,336
If the customer downgrades,
the new subscription goes


182
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,596
into effect at the end of the
current subscription period.


183
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:12,606
Okay. So, we've talked a
little bit about groups.


184
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,086
Now, let's take a
look at the structure


185
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:14,926
of one of these groups.


186
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,696
For those of you who are
using auto-renewables today,


187
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,896
you make recognize the
term subscription family.


188
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,696
Beginning this fall
we'll just be referring


189
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,296
to families as groups.


190
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:29,016
Here we have an example
of subscription service


191
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:31,246
that has three subscriptions
in it.


192
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:35,216
A one week, a one month,
and a one year subscription.


193
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:40,276
Today we have a restriction
that says you cannot have more


194
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,946
than one of the same
duration in a group.


195
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:46,606
So, in this case that means you
wouldn't be able to have more


196
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,606
than one, one year
subscription for example.


197
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,686
But, we will be removing this
subscription in the fall,


198
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,736
I mean this restriction
in the Fall.


199
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:59,976
So, that will allow you
to do something like this.


200
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,866
We call these subscription
levels.


201
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:06,876
Here you'll see an example that
has a silver level of service,


202
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:09,076
a gold level, and
a platinum level.


203
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:13,026
Each of these levels has two
subscription in it for a total


204
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:14,886
of six subscriptions
in this sample group.


205
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:19,066
You'll also notice on the
side that we have ranks.


206
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:22,676
This is how you decide
what is considered upgrade


207
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,876
and what is considered
a downgrade.


208
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,876
For example, if your customer
were to move from gold


209
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,446
to platinum, that would
be considered an upgrade,


210
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:34,466
and platinum would go
into effect right away.


211
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:39,336
If they went from gold to silver
as a downgrade, that would go


212
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:41,596
into effect at the end of
their current subscription.


213
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,156
Period. And those are
subscription groups.


214
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,826
So, I'd like to invite Jenn
up here to give us a demo


215
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,756
of such subscription
groups in iTunes Connect.


216
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:57,056
[ Applause ]


217
00:11:57,556 --> 00:11:59,316
>> Hi. I'm Jennifer Makower.


218
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,676
I'm an engineer on the
iTunes Connect team.


219
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,846
I'm going to walk you
through what we have coming


220
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:04,776
for subscriptions


221
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,576
and subscription groups
in iTunes Connect.


222
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,496
We're going to be working
with my app, Meal Manager,


223
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:12,536
which provides recipe and
shopping list subscriptions


224
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:14,366
for various meal plan types.


225
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:17,566
Now, currently we have
two meal plan types.


226
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,786
We have a dinner meal plan type


227
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,036
and we have a breakfast
meal plan type.


228
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:24,086
And both of those serve as
our subscription groups.


229
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,616
So, we're coming out with
a new subscription type,


230
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,656
which is going to be
our new meal plan.


231
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,026
It's going to be for
lunch subscriptions.


232
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,976
So, let's take a look in
iTunes Connect how we do that.


233
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:41,626
Here we go.


234
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,126
Okay. So, I'm going to click
on the plus button here,


235
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,826
next to in-app purchase


236
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:48,926
and select auto-renewable
subscription.


237
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,686
So, here's where
I'm going to come


238
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,666
up with my subscription name.


239
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,576
And when I create a new
subscription I'll be prompted


240
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:05,236
in a moment to select either
an existing subscription group


241
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,516
or create a new one.


242
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,316
So, we'll start with the
subscription name first.


243
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:11,136
This is going to be
for our lunch plan.


244
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:13,336
So, our first subscription's
going to be


245
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,556
about different sandwich types.


246
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:17,086
So, I'll type in sandwiches.


247
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:21,136
And here's where I'll
put in my product ID.


248
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,556
Now, once I create my
product ID in this flow,


249
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,376
it can't be edited later on.


250
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:27,766
So, I need to make sure
we put in the right one.


251
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:31,496
So, we're making
the one week version


252
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,976
of our sandwich subscription.


253
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,256
And then I'll click
next at the bottom.


254
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,386
So, here's where I'm going


255
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:44,806
to create our new subscription
group for our lunch plans.


256
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:50,406
And I'll type in
lunch plans here.


257
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:54,546
And then click on create.


258
00:13:56,686 --> 00:14:02,766
So, what we have here is our
redesigned in-app purchase page.


259
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:05,936
And I'll come back to this
in a moment to walk you


260
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,586
through what's on this page.


261
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:08,596
But, what I want to focus


262
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:10,596
on right now is subscription
groups.


263
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:14,376
So, I'm going to go to the
top of the page here and click


264
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:15,776
on lunch plans, which
will bring us


265
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,226
to our subscription group page.


266
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:25,146
So, here at the top you can
see we have the sandwiches


267
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:26,726
subscription that
we just created.


268
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,756
Below that we have
our subscription group


269
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:30,626
reference name.


270
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:35,246
And below that we have our
localized app store metadata.


271
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,146
And we can add additional
languages when you want


272
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,986
to localize for additional
languages.


273
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:42,236
As well we can go here


274
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:44,636
to override the app
name if we want to.


275
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,856
So, in this case my app name
is Meal Manager, Recipes,


276
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,366
and Shopping lists, which is
a little bit too long to show


277
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,046
up on the account
management page.


278
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,146
So, that would get truncated.


279
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:56,836
So, I'm going to
select use custom name,


280
00:14:56,836 --> 00:15:00,816
and just use the short version
of our app, Meal Manager,


281
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:04,816
and then go to the top of
the page and click save.


282
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:08,246
So, what I'd like to
show you next is how


283
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:11,006
to arrange multiple
subscriptions


284
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:12,926
to create an upgrade
and downgrade path.


285
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,646
So, I'm going to move over
to our breakfast plans,


286
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:20,926
which has a number of
subscriptions already in it.


287
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:25,736
And what we can do here is
arrange these subscriptions


288
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:29,506
so that they're in an order of
our upgrade and downgrade path.


289
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:33,116
So, first is our full course,


290
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,646
which will be our
highest level of service.


291
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,966
So, I'm going to pull that
out of the grouping here


292
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:37,926
and move it to the top.


293
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,706
And I'm going to take both
versions of the subscription.


294
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:44,136
We have a one week
and a one month.


295
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:48,956
And within one ranking
here this basically,


296
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:53,626
this can have differences
of either price or duration.


297
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,746
The main idea here is
that they're moving


298
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,096
between these two subscriptions.


299
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,676
It's neither an upgrade
or a downgrade.


300
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:05,926
And then I'll take omelets only
and move that to the bottom,


301
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,976
which is our lowest
level of service.


302
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,196
And then I'll click
save on the top here.


303
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:21,026
So, as Daniel explained,
all these subscriptions


304
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,966
within this group are
mutually exclusive.


305
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,466
So, a customer would
only have one


306
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:26,846
of these subscriptions
at a time.


307
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,606
If your intention is to
have your customer have two


308
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:33,236
subscriptions, they would need
to be in two separate groups.


309
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:37,376
So, now this is arranged in
my upgrade and downgrade path.


310
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:41,416
So, full course subscriptions
are the highest level


311
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:41,966
of service.


312
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,686
Muffins and omelets, movies


313
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:47,046
and omelets are my mid-range
subscription level of service.


314
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,586
And omelets only is my
lowest level of service.


315
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,416
And you can actually
have as many levels


316
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,116
of subscriptions as you want.


317
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:54,386
We just say three for now.


318
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:56,346
But, you can see the numbering


319
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:58,996
on the side here
indicates which level it is.


320
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,336
And that is about
subscription groups.


321
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,976
I'll give it back to Daniel.


322
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:07,006
[ Applause ]


323
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:07,955
>> Thanks, Jenn.


324
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:10,726
All right.


325
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:16,046
Now, let's move into how we'll
be changing the way you plan


326
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:18,195
price changes with
auto-renewables.


327
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:20,986
Will start with territory
pricing.


328
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:25,786
Today when you price an
auto-renewable subscription,


329
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:29,466
you choose one price tier
for the entire world.


330
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:35,506
Behind the scenes, this price
tier is associated with prices


331
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,026
in individual territories
around the world.


332
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:41,526
Now, we at Apple today manage
these prices on your behalf.


333
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:44,686
When there are currency
fluctuations we update these


334
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:45,516
prices for you.


335
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,726
Now, this has always
been convenient.


336
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:51,126
But, you asked us
for more flexibility.


337
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:56,156
So, beginning this fall, you'll
be able to price per territory.


338
00:17:57,516 --> 00:18:02,236
[ Applause ]


339
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,506
The way this will work is,


340
00:18:04,506 --> 00:18:07,706
instead of choosing a single
price tier, you'll start


341
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,356
with a base currency
and a base price.


342
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:14,426
This base price will come from
a predefined list of prices.


343
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:19,056
And as you move though the work
flow, we will generate prices


344
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,806
for each territory
that you select based


345
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:23,906
on the current exchange
rate at the time


346
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,196
that you plan the price change.


347
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:30,596
After we generate these
prices, you can go in


348
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,716
and you can edit the
price for say Austria.


349
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:38,816
Maybe you want to change the
price here from $1.99 to $2.99.


350
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:42,206
And you can do this for one
country, or you can do this


351
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,196
for multiple countries.


352
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,416
Once you set up these
prices and you've hit save,


353
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,636
this price change
goes into effect


354
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:51,936
at whatever start
date you've selected.


355
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:57,406
Next let's talk about
customer attention


356
00:18:57,946 --> 00:18:59,576
in the context of price changes.


357
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,996
So, one of the biggest
challenges today


358
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:06,166
with customer attention when we
change price is increasing the


359
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,716
price of subscription.


360
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:13,026
When we increase the price all
the customers that that affects,


361
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:18,586
which is all the customers,
receive an email that says


362
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:22,676
that the price has increased and
the subscriptions are stopped.


363
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:26,826
From here they have to go
into their app store app,


364
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,206
go into their account settings


365
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:30,706
and re-enable the
subscription at the new price.


366
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,146
Well, beginning this fall,


367
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:38,426
we're introducing a
streamlined consent process.


368
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:44,646
With this new process when a
customer receives price change


369
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,946
or a price increase they
will get a push notification


370
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,616
and an enhanced email.


371
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:53,096
From either the push
notification


372
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:57,716
or the email they can simply
tap and they'll go directly


373
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:58,706
into an app store page


374
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:00,856
where they can review the
new price and consent to it.


375
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:06,156
This gives your customers many
more opportunities to consent


376
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,666
in a more direct and
understandable way.


377
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:16,376
Now, no matter how good the, no
matter how good this flow is,


378
00:20:17,186 --> 00:20:19,776
if we increase the price
there's always a chance


379
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:20,986
that we can lose customers,


380
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:24,916
which is why we've added the
feature to preserve prices


381
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,976
for existing customers while
increasing prices for new ones.


382
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:34,556
[ Applause ]


383
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,256
Let's take a look at
how this might work.


384
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,316
Let's say we're launching
a new service in Japan.


385
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,376
We'd like to set our
initial price at 120 yen.


386
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,056
So, we set that up.


387
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,686
And once this in-app
purchase goes live,


388
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:54,616
we'll have our early
adopters paying 120


389
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:57,706
for both new subscriptions
and renewals.


390
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:00,626
Now, after some time has passed,


391
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,106
we're ready to launch
our product formally.


392
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:04,836
So, we get our marketing
teams ready.


393
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:05,866
We do a big push.


394
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:09,776
And we like to set our
launch pricing at 240 yen.


395
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:13,006
But, when we set
this price change,


396
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:15,256
we like to keep our
early adopters at 120,


397
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,376
because they've been loyal.


398
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,436
They've been sticking with us.


399
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:21,196
So, when this new price
change goes into effect,


400
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:24,646
we'll have our launch
customers paying 240


401
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,756
for both new subscriptions
and renewals.


402
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:30,416
And we'll have our early
adopters continuing paying 120


403
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:31,916
for their renewals.


404
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,706
Now, some more time passes and
we're ready to move the price


405
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,916
up to a new target price
that we've had in mind.


406
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:43,076
This new price is 360 yen.


407
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:46,556
But, this time when we want,
when this price change goes


408
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:50,026
into effect, we'd also like
to bring our launch customers


409
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:51,546
up to 360.


410
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:54,836
So, we set that in
our price change.


411
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:59,246
And once this goes into
effect, we have one set


412
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:02,576
of customers both launch
and post-launch paying 360.


413
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:06,876
And we have early adopters
still continuing at 120.


414
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:10,466
Now, notice here that the
launch customers did have their


415
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:11,526
prices increased.


416
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,466
So, they do get a
consent request.


417
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:18,216
Finally we've reached the
end of the year and we decide


418
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:21,516
that we're ready to simplify our
pricing going to the next year.


419
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:24,806
And we'd like to bring our
early adopters up to 360.


420
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,496
We go into iTunes Connect.


421
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:28,796
We edit that price change.


422
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:34,726
And once we hit save, our
early adopters move up to 360.


423
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:39,076
This change happens immediately,
unlike the other price changes


424
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:40,236
that we plan for the future.


425
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:46,126
Now, we have everybody paying
360 from here into the future


426
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,816
until we plan more
price changes.


427
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:53,796
Okay. I'd like to invite Jenn
back up here to give us a demo


428
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:55,976
of iTunes Connect and
the new price flow.


429
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:02,576
[ Applause ]


430
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,906
>> So to go back into
my Meal Manager app.


431
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:08,206
What we've decided to do
is market our subscriptions


432
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:09,606
with the three phrase approach.


433
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:12,986
So, when we launch a
subscription we're going to come


434
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:15,746
out with an initial price to
attract some early adopters.


435
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:18,106
And we're going to keep
them renewing at that price


436
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,556
for a certain amount of time,


437
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:22,196
then on our second
phase we're going


438
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:23,316
to raise the price a little,


439
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:27,526
but only do that in a
few select territories.


440
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,026
And then lastly we're going
move up to their target price


441
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,706
that we want to sell our
subscriptions at going forward.


442
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,346
So, let's get started
working on that.


443
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:39,366
So, I want to go
into my dinner plans.


444
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:46,086
And dessert and entree
is the next subscription


445
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:47,156
that we're going
to be releasing.


446
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,636
So, I need to go in and set
up some initial pricing.


447
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:53,656
So, this again is our
subscription group page.


448
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,856
And I can click into the
specific subscription here.


449
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,306
So, again this is our new
in-app purchase details page.


450
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,546
We have the reference
name at the top.


451
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:08,646
We have a subscription
duration underneath that.


452
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:11,666
We have the price
schedule below that.


453
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:13,496
And I'll come back to
that in a moment to set


454
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:14,476
up our initial pricing.


455
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:20,136
Again we have our
localized app store metadata.


456
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:23,046
And I can add additional
languages when I'm ready


457
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:26,036
to market this for
additional territories.


458
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:30,266
And then our app store,
app review information.


459
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:35,456
The screen shot should show
how our in-app purchase is,


460
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,316
presents itself within
the context of the app.


461
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,496
And we can put in some
additional app store review


462
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:45,156
notes there to help extra
find our in-app purchase.


463
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:50,076
So, I'm going to go click on set
price here below price schedule


464
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,086
to set up our initial pricing.


465
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,646
So, my base currency
is U.S. dollar.


466
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:57,436
And that can be set
as a preference


467
00:24:57,436 --> 00:24:57,976
within your user profile.


468
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:02,406
And I'm going select
the initial price


469
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:04,536
for this subscription
at 99 cents.


470
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,056
And then click on
next at the bottom.


471
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:11,376
So, these are the prices
that were calculated based


472
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,626
on current exchange rates.


473
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:14,696
If one of these territories,


474
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:17,556
I have some additional licensing
fees or other business needs


475
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:18,656
and I need to raise the price


476
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:21,446
for that one particular
territory I can come in


477
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:25,526
and select this and move it
up whichever price I need to.


478
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,926
And if I forget which
one was the initial price


479
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,606
that had been calculated
I can come over here


480
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:31,366
and it will remind me.


481
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:35,526
So, I'm going to scroll
down to the bottom here


482
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:36,826
and go click on done.


483
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:40,266
And then click on okay.


484
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:42,116
So, once this subscription
goes live,


485
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,076
that will be our price
for the subscription.


486
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:48,276
So, I'm going to click on
save at the top of the screen.


487
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:55,736
And then go back to our
subscription group page and move


488
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:58,116
to our appetizer on
entree subscription.


489
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:03,736
So, in this case we've
launched our app.


490
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,876
We have some initial
early adopters.


491
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,446
And I want to raise
the price a little bit


492
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:09,816
for our next phase of marketing.


493
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:13,386
So, I'm going to click
on plan a price change.


494
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:16,706
So, as I said in this case we're
going to be raising the price,


495
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:18,386
but only in a few
select territories.


496
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:21,546
So, I'm going to pick the
United States and Canada,


497
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:26,886
Italy, Spain, and France.


498
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:29,216
And then click on next.


499
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:35,956
The price, the date for this
change will happen on June 24th.


500
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:40,126
And again, my base
currency is U.S. dollar.


501
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:44,056
And I'm going to make the
price $1.99 for this change.


502
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:46,086
And then click on next.


503
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:49,916
So, again these are the
current exchange rates for,


504
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,876
based on my base
price selection.


505
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:54,236
And I can see here what
the initial price was.


506
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:57,826
You know, we originally selected
99 cents for the early adopters.


507
00:26:57,886 --> 00:27:00,756
And the new price will be $1.99.


508
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:04,046
And then I'll click
on next at the bottom.


509
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:07,486
And here's where we're
going to handle what to do


510
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:08,706
with our existing subscribers.


511
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:11,736
In this case we're going to
keep our early adopters renewing


512
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,706
at the price that they
originally subscribed at.


513
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:18,046
And this change will be for
new subscribers that come


514
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,676
on starting from the date
that I selected earlier.


515
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:23,756
So, I'm going to click on done.


516
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,996
And that change will go
into effect on June 24th.


517
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:29,216
That's the date that I selected.


518
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:30,946
And click okay.


519
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:34,976
And, so then we we'll have
two prices going forward


520
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:36,906
for this subscription.


521
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:41,746
And I can change this price
if I need to up until the date


522
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,106
that it goes into effect.


523
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:47,276
So, I'm going to go click on
save at the top of the screen.


524
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:53,936
And then go back to our
subscription group page and move


525
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:55,596
to our entree only subscription.


526
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:02,656
Now in this case we've gone
through those two phases


527
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,836
of marketing and we're
ready to raise the price


528
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,446
to our target price
that we wanted


529
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:08,976
to sell the subscription
at going forward.


530
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:11,896
So, I'm going to click on
plan a price change here


531
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:12,646
in the price schedule.


532
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:14,616
And now in this case I'm going


533
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:15,956
to apply this to
all territories.


534
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,376
So, I click this
box at the top here


535
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:21,216
and click next at
the bottom here.


536
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:26,206
Again our date for our marketing
campaign will be the 24th.


537
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,506
So, I'll select that date.


538
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:34,106
And the price change will be
$2.99 for this subscription.


539
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:35,156
Again, select next.


540
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:40,056
And once again we have
the calculated prices.


541
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:44,156
And I can see that the last
price change we had was $1.99


542
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:44,626
on March 18th.


543
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,486
And our new price is
going to be $2.99.


544
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:50,706
So, I've clicked
next at the bottom.


545
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:57,556
Now in this case for our
existing subscribers,


546
00:28:57,706 --> 00:29:01,006
the last price change, I want to
move anyone that had subscribed


547
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:03,556
after that point up
to this new pricing.


548
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:06,336
But, we're still going to keep
our early adopters at their,


549
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:09,206
renewing at that original
price that they had.


550
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:10,836
So, this change I only want


551
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:14,826
to affect just the existing
subscribers that came in since


552
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,116
that last price change.


553
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:19,886
So, in this case I'm going
to select apply price change


554
00:29:19,886 --> 00:29:21,066
to existing subscribers.


555
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:24,266
And I've applied it
to all territories.


556
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:26,796
But, I can go and select
individual territories


557
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:28,486
that this would apply
to if I needed to.


558
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:31,456
And I can see here, it
says existing subscribers,


559
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,756
$1.99 subscribers
will now pay $2.99.


560
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,916
And that is what I want to do.


561
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,436
So, I'm going to click on next.


562
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:43,966
And it's important to note that
once this price change goes


563
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,566
into effect it cannot
be changed.


564
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:50,736
And once it does go into effect,
the user that will be renewing,


565
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:54,476
that will have their price
effected, will be notified


566
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:55,266
that their price has changed.


567
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:56,406
And they will need to consent


568
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:58,936
to that higher price before
their subscription renews.


569
00:29:59,636 --> 00:30:01,976
So, that is what we want to do.


570
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:04,986
So, I'm going to go ahead and
select the check box here,


571
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:10,056
and then click done,
and then click on okay.


572
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:14,146
So, once this price change
goes into effect, it will be --


573
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,346
you won't be able to
go back and change it.


574
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,296
But, we can edit it
up until that point


575
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:19,426
that it goes into effect.


576
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:25,336
So, I'm going to select save
at the top here and go back


577
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:26,816
to our subscription group page.


578
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,166
And for our last task
we're going to a look


579
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,576
at our full course subscription.


580
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:38,116
So, now in this case we have hit
the target price that we wanted.


581
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:42,576
And it's time to move those
early adopters into our pricing


582
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,886
so we can simplify the
price for this subscription.


583
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,126
So, I want us to take a
look at what we have here.


584
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:49,846
I want to click on the
March 18th date here.


585
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:53,396
And I can see that
the current price


586
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:56,096
for new subscribers is $4.99.


587
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:58,116
And I can even see
what my proceeds are


588
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,016
for the first year
for new subscribers.


589
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:02,746
And if they stay
with us for a year


590
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:06,216
or more I can see what my
proceeds will be for, from that.


591
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:08,906
So, I'm going to click on done.


592
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:14,156
But, what I want to do is raise
our early adopter price up.


593
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:16,406
So, I'm going to click
on initial price here.


594
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:19,586
And here I can see that these
subscribers are paying 99 cents.


595
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,716
So, we want to move them up.


596
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,636
So, I'm going to click on
show price change options.


597
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:28,746
And here I can see
the again, 99 cents.


598
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:31,606
And that the current is $4.99.


599
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:34,456
So, I'm going to click
this check box up here.


600
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,406
That will apply it
to all territories.


601
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,366
And again, if I need to I can
selected individual territories


602
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:42,506
to apply this to if I
want to do it that way.


603
00:31:42,506 --> 00:31:46,196
So, here it says 99 cent
subscribers will pay $4.99.


604
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,466
That will simplify a pricing
for this subscription.


605
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:50,516
So, I'm going to go
ahead and click next.


606
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:54,476
Now in this case, the
price change will take


607
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:55,686
effect immediately.


608
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:58,176
So, as soon as I
click save, that's it.


609
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,836
It cannot be edited or changed.


610
00:32:00,356 --> 00:32:03,866
So, they will, and when
the Windows subscribers,


611
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,826
when it's time for them to renew
they will get the agreement.


612
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:11,546
You know, the consent request
to consent to the higher price


613
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,896
for this subscription
before the subscription will


614
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:14,786
automatically renew.


615
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,046
And that is what we want to do.


616
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:18,586
So, I'm going to go ahead


617
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:24,486
and select the check box
here and then click done.


618
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,796
And then click on okay.


619
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:32,576
And now we have one price
for the subscription.


620
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,216
So, once I click save
that will save the changes


621
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:36,906
and it will not be
able to be edited.


622
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:39,976
And that is territory pricing.


623
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:43,656
[ Applause ]


624
00:32:44,156 --> 00:32:44,986
>> Hey, thanks again, Jenn.


625
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:48,166
All right.


626
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,666
So, we talked about a
lot of things today.


627
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,056
So, a quick recap of
what those items were.


628
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:55,496
We talked about increased
proceeds.


629
00:32:56,256 --> 00:32:59,826
You'll be receiving 85%
proceeds for any customers


630
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:02,506
that haven't subscribed
for one year or more.


631
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,506
We're expanding to
all categories


632
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,956
for auto-renewable
subscriptions.


633
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:11,426
We're giving you the
ability to define,


634
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:12,896
upgraded, and downgrade paths.


635
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:17,626
We're allowing you to
price per territory.


636
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:22,306
We're streamlining
the consent work flow.


637
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:26,916
And we're giving you the
ability to preserve prices


638
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:30,686
for existing customers while
increasing prices for new ones.

We also have a number
of related sessions.

00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,196

app using StoreKit


646
