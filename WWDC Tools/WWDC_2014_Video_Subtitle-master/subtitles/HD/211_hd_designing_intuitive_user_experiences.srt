1
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:13,586
>> Hello everyone.


2
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:20,776
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:22,806
>> So I'm Mike Stern.


4
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:25,236
I'm a User Experience
Evangelist at Apple,


5
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,706
and thank you all for coming.


6
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:30,026
And sticking around,
after a really long day


7
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:31,196
of very technical content.


8
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,736
Now, this presentation is going
to be a bit different, right?


9
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:35,916
This is about design.


10
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:40,046
And in particular, it's about
designing intuitive interfaces.


11
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:43,806
I'd like to start with
a little exercise.


12
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:47,456
Imagine if you will that
you're at your house,


13
00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:50,696
and you're in your kitchen,
and the phone rings.


14
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:52,576
And the person on the other end


15
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:54,816
of the line has some really
exciting news for you.


16
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,516
They tell you that
you've won some money.


17
00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:02,136
Not just a little bit of
money, but like a lot of money.


18
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:06,476
And they also tell you that
in order to claim your prize,


19
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:10,266
you need to call a phone number.


20
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:14,326
And then, they hang
up the phone.


21
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:18,166
And so you're sitting there
in your kitchen, and you need


22
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,776
to write down this phone number.


23
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,976
And you need to write down
this phone number before you


24
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:23,766
forget it.


25
00:01:24,496 --> 00:01:28,106
So you're looking around
for something to write with.


26
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,306
Your iPhone is not
around, right?


27
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,686
And you're casting
around, and you're starting


28
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:34,586
to get a little panicky
because you really want


29
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:37,556
to remember this number, and
right before you forget it,


30
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,446
you see a pen and a piece
of paper, and you write


31
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:41,166
down the phone number.


32
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:45,036
So that's a pretty
simple scenario, right?


33
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:46,426
That was the end of
the story, by the way.


34
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,626
[Applause] Thank you, thank
you very much [laughter].


35
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:54,706
So you had this very clear
objective, which was to write


36
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:58,526
down this phone number, and you
found a pen and a pad of paper


37
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:02,146
with which to accomplish
that task, and then you wrote


38
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:03,036
down the phone number.


39
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,686
And that was it.


40
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:09,686
Well, it's not really
quite that simple.


41
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:10,675
You were under pressure.


42
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:12,326
You were stressing
out a little bit,


43
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:14,856
and when you're stressed out,
that can affect your memory.


44
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:16,786
And it can affect your ability


45
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:18,966
to perform basic
cognitive tasks,


46
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,876
such as remembering a phone
number and writing it down.


47
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:26,036
Or picking out a pen from
a bunch of similar objects,


48
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:28,226
things that look
just like a pen.


49
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,856
And assuming that you can
remember the phone number,


50
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,696
and find the pen and
paper, and write it down,


51
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,206
you have to also consider,
what are all the skills


52
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:38,856
that are necessary
for you to write?


53
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:41,426
For starters, writing
involves a lot


54
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,626
of coordination and dexterity.


55
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,516
Just ask a 3-year-old.


56
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,616
They totally suck at
writing [laughter].


57
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:55,026
And so did all of you, and so
did I, when we were that age.


58
00:02:55,826 --> 00:03:00,056
We went from writing like
this-- to writing like that.


59
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:04,676
Or at least something like this.


60
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:07,866
Writing with a pen takes
years and years of practice,


61
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:11,726
and there's all of these small
little skills that you need


62
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,016
to learn along the way.


63
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,506
They're so fluid and
natural to you now,


64
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:17,316
but they weren't always so easy.


65
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:21,416
You had to gain the eye-hand
coordination to be able to pick


66
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,006
up and manipulate small objects.


67
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:28,266
And it took years to learn
how to hold a pen properly,


68
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,166
and position your
wrist on the table,


69
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,546
and your arm for stability.


70
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,916
You had to learn how to
draw basic letter forms.


71
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,426
Or write along a straight line.


72
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:39,386
You needed to learn the
difference between upper case


73
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,526
and lower case letters.


74
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:42,096
The list goes on.


75
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:46,566
But you don't think about any of
those things when you're sitting


76
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,876
in your kitchen and writing
down that phone number.


77
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:56,486
All of those years of writing
with different types of pens


78
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,086
and pencils and markers


79
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:01,676
and crayons have given
you this tremendous amount


80
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:02,696
of muscle memory.


81
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,536
And that muscle memory frees you


82
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,726
to remember something
like a phone number.


83
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,646
If you had to consciously
remember all


84
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:14,826
of those individual skills,
it would be pretty difficult


85
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:21,986
for you to have accomplished
that task.


86
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:26,396
In other words, it's easier
for you to have written down


87
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,666
and remembered that phone
number because the act


88
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,236
of writing is so intuitive.


89
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:33,306
Using software is no different.


90
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:37,016
The more apps behave
as we expect them to,


91
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:39,316
the more intuitive
they are to us.


92
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:43,286
The more intuitive apps are
to us, the easier it is for us


93
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:45,426
to concentrate on
our true objectives,


94
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,056
whether that's communicating
with friends, capturing memories


95
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,566
of loved ones, checking
the weather,


96
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,046
or exploring the cosmos.


97
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:01,376
The very best user interfaces
are so intuitive, so natural,


98
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:05,216
that they just sort of
disappear, and allow us to focus


99
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:07,006
on what truly matters.


100
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:09,636
That is what we call intuitive.


101
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:16,056
So with that in mind, what
makes an app intuitive?


102
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,476
Well, I've put together
a list of what I believe


103
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:21,356
to be the top five
characteristics


104
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,586
of intuitive user and
interface designs.


105
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,046
And this is not an
exhaustive list.


106
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:31,086
We could be here for hours
and hours and hours talking


107
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,386
about all of the things that
makes something intuitive.


108
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,226
We would order pizza,
get drinks,


109
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:36,496
it would be a lot of fun.


110
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,666
But unfortunately, we don't
have the time for that today.


111
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:43,696
This list of five things
I think are the most basic


112
00:05:43,696 --> 00:05:45,266
and essential characteristics


113
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,076
of what makes an iOS
or Mac app intuitive.


114
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:52,026
And I also want to point out up
front here that what's intuitive


115
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:55,646
to one person may not be
so intuitive to others.


116
00:05:56,436 --> 00:06:00,126
I mean, this is intuitive
if you're an airline pilot.


117
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:03,656
Every button, every switch,
every display is there


118
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,016
for a very good reason.


119
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,276
You know where everything is.


120
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:07,686
Totally natural.


121
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:13,766
I'm pretty sure this
doesn't work [laughter].


122
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:17,746
I also want to point out
that these are the most


123
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:18,966
fundamental things.


124
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,166
The most basic things.


125
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,066
But design is just like
anything else in life.


126
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:26,606
I mean, sometimes the most basic
things are the most important.


127
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:28,676
The most consequential.


128
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:32,066
I've been designing for many
years, and I've seen time


129
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,296
and time again, even
the most seasoned,


130
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:38,416
the most experienced designers,
who make poor quality designs


131
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:40,646
because they've lost
sight of the fundamentals.


132
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,166
Now, in order for a
pen to be intuitive,


133
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:47,336
it needs to get some
very fundamental


134
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:49,306
or basic things just right.


135
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:55,006
It needs to be wide enough to
grip firmly, but not so wide


136
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:57,086
that it can't be
manipulated easily.


137
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:02,166
If a pen is too thin, or too
wide, it becomes intuitive


138
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,756
because we become aware of it.


139
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,926
We're trying to think how are
we going to write with this pen?


140
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,176
It doesn't feel quite right.


141
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,916
Or if a pen was too short,


142
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:15,216
we would not know how
to hold it, right?


143
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:17,966
We would pick it up with our
fingertips and we'd be writing


144
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:19,726
with it, it'd be going
all over the place,


145
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,446
and what we write
wouldn't look very good.


146
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,836
We'd be very conscious
of the pen itself.


147
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:29,216
Or if a pen was too long,
there'd be an opposite problem.


148
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,536
The top of the pen would be
swinging all over the place,


149
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,746
it would feel heavy,
our hands would strain.


150
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,556
Again, we'd be very
conscious of the pen itself.


151
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,606
Designing a pen to have
the right diameter,


152
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:43,836
or the right length,
seem like pretty basic


153
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:45,136
and obvious things, right?


154
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:50,976
Yet, there are countless pen
and app designs that fail


155
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:53,136
because their designers
have lost sight


156
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,736
of these fundamentals.


157
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,506
And before we dive in, I'll
just say one more thing,


158
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:02,266
which is that being intuitive
is not very intuitive.


159
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:04,766
It's actually pretty
difficult to do.


160
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,166
You have to understand the fact


161
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,656
that you're not designing
just for yourself.


162
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,656
You're designing
for other people.


163
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,206
And those people, they don't
know the things that you know.


164
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:19,456
And they frankly probably
aren't as passionate


165
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:21,006
about your app as you are.


166
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:24,776
So they're going to tend
to be a bit impatient,


167
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,936
easily frustrated,
fickle, right?


168
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:31,376
Designing an intuitive
interface isn't possible


169
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,765
until you can get
out of your own head.


170
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:36,726
You need to recognize your
own assumptions about things.


171
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,666
About who the people
you're designing for are,


172
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,346
what they're trying
to accomplish.


173
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,645
What they know, what
they don't know.


174
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:47,946
You need to see clearly, and
you need to hear clearly,


175
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:53,066
and figure out what it is that
you can do to help them succeed.


176
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:57,376
If you can do that, you will
have done an amazing thing.


177
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:02,556
People will appreciate the
fact that you cared enough


178
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:04,436
to make a great user experience.


179
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:07,356
So let's dive in, and find


180
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,196
out what the top five
characteristics are,


181
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:11,976
starting with platform savvy.


182
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,476
Now, let's go back
to pens again.


183
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:21,036
You see this particular
pen, but you're not going


184
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,586
to have any trouble
writing with it,


185
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:25,916
because you've used thousands
and thousands of pens before,


186
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:29,376
and those experiences, writing
with all those different pens,


187
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,726
has given you this
generalized understanding


188
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:33,176
of how all pens work.


189
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,196
They have shaped your
expectations, and they're going


190
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:38,526
to influence your behavior.


191
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:42,926
And when you pick up that
pen, and you write with it,


192
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,746
sure enough, it works
like you expected it to.


193
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,776
And if it didn't, you'd
become frustrated.


194
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,666
When someone uses your
app for the first time,


195
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,756
they do so with all
sorts of expectations


196
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:59,306
about how it's supposed to work.


197
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:03,676
Now, these expectations
are formed and affected


198
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,596
by so many different factors,
but the most important


199
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:11,266
of those is that individual's
experience using other iOS


200
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,196
or Mac apps.


201
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,686
Those could be ones that
were built into their device


202
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:18,566
when they purchased it, or
they could be ones that many


203
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:22,506
of you here today
have made for them.


204
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:24,496
Now, let's just take
a look at an example.


205
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:28,066
Swiping a table row to
reveal some actions.


206
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,086
In particular, let's look
at swiping a table row


207
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,656
to reveal some kind of Delete
button or Trash button.


208
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,336
Now, we're all really
familiar with this.


209
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:40,516
And we first encountered it
maybe with Mail, and we thought,


210
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,446
hey, that's kind of neat, right?


211
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,456
I don't have to go open the
E-mail to see the Trash button


212
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:47,446
so that I can delete it.


213
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,156
I don't have to go into
some kind of edit mode,


214
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,836
I can just use a gesture
to delete it right away.


215
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:54,776
And after doing this
a couple of times,


216
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:56,736
well you got into
the habit of it.


217
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:01,406
You started to learn to expect
this behavior, this interaction.


218
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:05,006
Now you open Notes for
the very first time.


219
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:07,606
Never seen this before,
and, you know,


220
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,496
notes looks a little
bit different from Mail,


221
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,066
but not completely different.


222
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:12,876
There's some similarities.


223
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:16,096
Like Mail, everything is
arrayed in a scrollable view,


224
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:19,296
and there's these little gray
lines that separate them,


225
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,136
and you know, you figure


226
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,786
that like E-mail messages,
Notes can be deleted.


227
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:30,246
So you think to yourself,
well I should be able to swipe


228
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:31,656
to reveal a Delete button.


229
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,086
You don't even have
to think about it.


230
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,436
In fact, you probably don't.


231
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:40,306
You try swiping to delete,


232
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:44,186
because unconsciously you
believe that it should work.


233
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:45,886
Intuitively, you
think it should work.


234
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,376
And when it does,
you're rewarded


235
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,516
with the outcome
that you expected.


236
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,226
And if it didn't, you
would be frustrated.


237
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:55,306
You would say "why
did they not do that?"


238
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,616
It makes so much sense, right?


239
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,736
You now have to figure out how
you're going to delete a Note.


240
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,486
Swiping to delete is
a platform convention,


241
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,156
and it's among thousands
and thousands


242
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:07,916
of different platform
conventions


243
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:10,706
that iOS users have
come to expect.


244
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:14,976
And not only do they expect
swipe to delete to work


245
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,466
in whatever situation it would
make sense for it to work,


246
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,976
they expect every aspect
of that interaction


247
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,546
to match their previous
experience.


248
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:27,836
From the sense of
direct manipulation,


249
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:31,506
to how far they need to drag
the row to reveal the buttons,


250
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:34,856
maybe even the color and the
size of the button itself.


251
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:39,666
Any deviations from these
things, no matter how small


252
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:43,546
or insignificant, could be
incorrectly perceived by them


253
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,676
as being meaningfully different.


254
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:49,276
Or maybe they just
get this vague sense


255
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,756
that something's
not quite right.


256
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:54,176
Being consistent with
platform conventions,


257
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,206
in other words, is
a very good thing.


258
00:12:57,146 --> 00:13:02,286
Gestures like pinch, swipe,
pan, tap, they should work


259
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:06,286
in very consistent ways, no
matter what type of app we use.


260
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,886
Same is true for controls,
like switches or buttons,


261
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:15,936
or navigation bars,
tables, and tab bars.


262
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:22,596
And there are also powerful
conventions about the labels


263
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,856
that we use to convey
certain actions,


264
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,246
or the icons that we use.


265
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:30,466
Now, this symbol may have
not been immediately familiar


266
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:31,796
to you the first
time you saw it,


267
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,666
but after you shared
something a couple of times,


268
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,896
you started to get a sense of
what that symbol represents.


269
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:42,166
You know what kind of
functionality is accessed


270
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,146
by tapping that button.


271
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:49,336
And these conventions that
exist, at least for iOS and Mac,


272
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,706
are not at all arbitrary.


273
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,926
Swiping to delete
isn't just intuitive


274
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:58,706
because of the thousands and
thousands of apps that support


275
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,396
that same interaction.


276
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:04,906
It's consistent, or
sorry, that's a part of it,


277
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:06,036
but it's not the whole story.


278
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,186
It's intuitive to
us because it's


279
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:11,786
like the real-world experiences
that we all share together.


280
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:15,656
It's like crossing something
off of a list, or you know,


281
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,366
being a 2-year-old
and eating food


282
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,746
and swiping it out of your way.


283
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:20,996
Right? You don't want it
anymore, so you're going


284
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:22,706
to swipe to get rid of it.


285
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,526
There is countless, countless
conventions that exist


286
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,016
for any platform for
which you're designing,


287
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:31,936
and it's important to recognize
what those conventions are,


288
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:35,026
because that's what
people are going to expect.


289
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,686
But sometimes it's necessary
to break those conventions.


290
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,766
Now, this is actually
not that common,


291
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:47,546
but maybe you're designing an
app that's never existed before.


292
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,236
A new type of experience.


293
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:51,636
Or you're designing
for a new type of user,


294
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,506
a new type of scenario,
or context?


295
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:57,006
Maybe you're just trying
to solve a problem that we,


296
00:14:57,006 --> 00:15:00,176
at Apple, or other, you
guys have never tried


297
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:01,576
to solve before, right?


298
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,236
So there is no precedent
to follow.


299
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:07,876
Now, if that's the case for
you, you have a responsibility


300
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:12,196
to tell people, to inform
them that you have decided


301
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:14,766
to do something different
with your app.


302
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,396
Now, let's take a
look at an example.


303
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,236
This is Leo's Fortune.


304
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:21,106
We saw that it won
ADA yesterday.


305
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:24,266
That's Leo, up there,
on the wooden scale.


306
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:27,046
Now, as you can see,
there's only one button


307
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:28,356
on the screen, the Pause button.


308
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:31,006
Everything else is
done through gestures.


309
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,976
And these gestures,
they're intuitive,


310
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,386
but they're not standard.


311
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,716
They're not really obvious.


312
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,646
So the game provides
instruction.


313
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,676
It teaches you about
them one at a time.


314
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:44,636
You use your left thumb
to move left and right


315
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:46,276
so that he moves
forward and backwards.


316
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,976
Or you swipe up your
right thumb to inflate Leo


317
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:53,096
so that he can hop over
obstacles like this ledge.


318
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:57,656
These are non-standard
interactions and the developers


319
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,036
of this game knew that they had
to educate people about them,


320
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:03,256
or else players would
be confused,


321
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:04,666
and they would become
frustrated,


322
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,416
quit and delete the game.


323
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:08,966
Wouldn't be a very good
experience for them.


324
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:13,006
Now, that's all I'm going to
say when it comes to onboarding


325
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,576
and help today, because we
have an entire hour dedicated


326
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,226
to this topic.


327
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:19,666
It's a really great
presentation,


328
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,986
and I encourage everyone
here to go.


329
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:24,896
It's Thursday, in the Mission.


330
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:26,636
I'll see you there.


331
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:32,186
The next characteristic of
intuitive user interfaces is


332
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:34,796
that they're easy to navigate.


333
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:39,866
Now, intuitive navigation
systems do three things


334
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:40,816
really well.


335
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:44,016
First, they just tell
you where you are.


336
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:49,356
The clock app, with its tab bar,
does a really good job of that.


337
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:52,376
Makes it perfectly clear
what your location is.


338
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:55,806
And I'm sorry it's so low on the
screen, I know everyone is going


339
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,576
to have to crane their
necks in order to see it.


340
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:00,916
Now apps that use
a Navigation Bar


341
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,476
and have a title also
do a really good job


342
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:04,506
of telling you where you are.


343
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,156
The title serves that purpose.


344
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,976
The next thing that
they do is they show you


345
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:10,356
where else you could go.


346
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:12,866
They show you what
your options are.


347
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,715
So the phone app,
again with a tab bar,


348
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:16,766
does a very good job of it.


349
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,496
It just means having everything
on screen and visible.


350
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:20,425
Pretty simple.


351
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:25,205
And the third thing that they
do is they explain what's there.


352
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:29,786
Meaning the navigation
system informs you


353
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:32,326
about what's contained
within each section.


354
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:34,716
You don't have to go
to every single section


355
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:35,946
to figure out what's inside.


356
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,496
So let's take a step
back for a second, right?


357
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,766
Why do we need navigation
to begin with?


358
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:47,056
We need navigation because
there's way too much information


359
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:49,946
and functionality in
any given app to display


360
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:52,056
on screen at one point in time.


361
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:56,176
So we group things together.


362
00:17:56,376 --> 00:18:01,236
Make these categories, or
sections, and these categories


363
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:05,286
that we come up with, they need
to be understandable and logical


364
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,176
to people who are
using your app.


365
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:12,656
It shouldn't feel like a mystery
what's behind or what's inside


366
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:15,146
of each of these
category labels.


367
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:20,806
So the phone app succeeds
because each of these icons


368
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:24,986
and labels that's used makes the
content inside self-explanatory.


369
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:27,676
Meaning, it provides a good
explanation of what types


370
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:31,136
of key information or
functionality is contained


371
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:36,206
within each section of the app.


372
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:40,406
So in other words, intuitive
navigation systems answer three


373
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:41,506
basic questions.


374
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:42,956
Where am I?


375
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:45,336
Where else can I go?


376
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,416
And what will I find
when I get there?


377
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,996
Now, these seem like
really basic things, right?


378
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,356
Everyone here is
kind of smirking,


379
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:54,926
it's like totally obvious.


380
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:58,556
But it turns out that
designing a navigation system


381
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:02,266
that can accomplish these
three things well is pretty


382
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,486
challenging to make.


383
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,686
So with that in mind, I
have a few tips for you


384
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,696
about how you can make
your navigation system


385
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:10,866
really intuitive.


386
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:13,276
Starting with progressive
disclosure.


387
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:16,426
Now, if you're not familiar


388
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:18,616
with what this term
is, it's pretty simple.


389
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,746
It just means not
showing things to people


390
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:24,386
until they actually need it.


391
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:28,476
Now, you do that by kind
of creating a little bit


392
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:32,176
of a deeper hierarchy, or adding
a few more steps in a process.


393
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,436
Now this seems like it
might take more time to get


394
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:38,046
to your destination,
or get the outcome


395
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,556
that you're after,
but it's worth it.


396
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:44,646
Because it makes decision making
simple and un-intimidating


397
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:46,226
at every stage of the process.


398
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:48,486
So ultimately, you're
able to get


399
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:51,676
to your destination more
quickly and more confidently.


400
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:55,436
Unless, that is, you
use category names


401
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:58,396
that aren't logical,
or not meaningful.


402
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:01,906
So in this situation, if
you're reading the slide,


403
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:04,016
we're picking a mode of
transportation for getting


404
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:05,776
from one place to another.


405
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:08,276
And if we're doing
that, the first choice


406
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,356
that we have is do
you want to go by air


407
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:11,616
or do you want to go by land?


408
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,376
Now, that makes a
lot of sense, right?


409
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:16,616
Those things are kind of
mutually exclusive choices.


410
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:20,986
And these labels are pretty good
because if we're going to go


411
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,096
by air, we figure
that one of the items


412
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:27,956
in that category is going to
be a choice to go by airplane.


413
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:32,106
Or if we're going by land, we're
going to have the options to go


414
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,776
by car or maybe by rail.


415
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:36,586
We don't know all of the choices
that are contained inside,


416
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:37,956
but we get an inkling.


417
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,266
We get an understanding


418
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,306
about what things
are contained within.


419
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:45,786
Now, if we decide to go by
land, we get the second choice.


420
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:49,556
This is a disastrous
set of labels for us.


421
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:54,936
Now, we can go take a mode of
transportation that uses fuel,


422
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,346
or it doesn't use
fuel, but now all


423
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,396
of a sudden we're
thinking about,


424
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:01,336
well okay a car uses fuel.


425
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:07,036
But if I want to take a
train, does that use fuel?


426
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:10,216
I mean, it's like, steam power?


427
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,356
Fuel? Or coal?


428
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,506
Right? What if it's electric?


429
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:17,136
What if I'm taking
light rail, you know?


430
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:19,486
Maybe that's no fuel, I
mean it's electricity,


431
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,326
but it could be solar powered,


432
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:23,546
or wind powered,
or nuclear powered.


433
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:26,396
Instead of getting to where
I want to go, I'm asking all


434
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:29,896
of these esoteric questions
about the nature of fuel


435
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,806
and the meaning of
that word, right?


436
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,406
These are not very good labels.


437
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:36,276
That uncertainty is
causing hesitation,


438
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:39,766
and it's making me aware
of the interface itself


439
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,086
and trying to decode it.


440
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:45,206
Again, use progressive
disclosure, but make sure


441
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,486
that it doesn't feel like
you're trying to figure


442
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:48,956
out what's behind door number 3.


443
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:53,836
Now, the next tip I have
is about being predictable.


444
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,546
Everyone likes surprises, right?


445
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,986
Except when it comes
to navigation.


446
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:01,856
With navigation, we
do not like surprises.


447
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:06,086
When navigation changes on
us unexpectedly and in ways


448
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:08,536
that we can't explain
or rationalize,


449
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,396
we can get really
confused and tripped up.


450
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:14,756
So let's take a look
at how this can happen.


451
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:17,806
So let's say we're making
a banking app, right?


452
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:20,386
And we have a few
choices to select from.


453
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:23,966
And then once we
register and then log in,


454
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,196
there's a few other
sections that are added.


455
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:29,346
So the navigation has changed,
but I guess I can explain


456
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:32,126
to myself why things changed
in the way that they did.


457
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,706
Or maybe the bank
decides they're going


458
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:38,536
to add this awesome new feature
of giving away free cash, right?


459
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:40,236
I want to bank at this bank.


460
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:41,746
This is a great feature.


461
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:43,696
So they put it right at the top,


462
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,176
because they think their
customers are really going


463
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:45,576
to love it.


464
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,616
But then someone comes to
their senses and decides


465
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:50,736
that they're not going to be
able to give away that feature


466
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:53,966
of free cash much longer,
so they de-emphasize it


467
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,136
and they reduce its
visibility in the list


468
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,336
by pushing it to the bottom.


469
00:22:57,896 --> 00:22:59,146
So it's changed.


470
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:03,066
Or let's say we looked at
the analytics of the app,


471
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,426
and we've talked to all the
people who are using it,


472
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,686
and we figured out that
people really want mostly


473
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:11,096
to find locations or figure
out how to contact the bank,


474
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:12,646
so we move that stuff
to the top.


475
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:17,036
Now there's hundreds of reasons
why navigation can change.


476
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,566
Some of them are good, some of
them are bad or just terrible,


477
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:22,336
but whatever the reason is,


478
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:27,286
there's always this downside
retraining people on how


479
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:30,366
to do something that they're
familiar with, takes time,


480
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:32,066
and it can be really
frustrating for people.


481
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,176
I mean I think we've
all had this experience


482
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:36,426
where we've been going to
like a website or using an app


483
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,516
for a very long period of time,
and then it was redesigned,


484
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:41,636
and all of a sudden
we're thrown off.


485
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,986
We have to study the
interface and figure


486
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:45,376
out where things went to.


487
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:47,056
We had just been used


488
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,006
to pressing the red
thing over there, right?


489
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:51,886
We weren't even reading
the label, and now we have


490
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:54,216
to study it, and figure
out where that went to.


491
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:57,366
Even the smallest changes
can really trip people up.


492
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:00,596
So by all means, change your
interface when you need to,


493
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:03,436
but do it carefully, and
don't do it frequently.


494
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:08,226
Now, the next point
is really obvious.


495
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:10,876
But it's worth talking
about anyway,


496
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:14,886
and that is that selection
needs to be immediately obvious.


497
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:20,166
On iOS tab bars, for example,
we use color to show selection.


498
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:22,596
And we also use shape.


499
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:24,556
So on the left-hand side,


500
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:26,776
you can see sometimes
icons get filled in,


501
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,676
and on the right
side you can see


502
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,796
that sometimes they get thicker.


503
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:33,526
Now part of the reason for
this is that it makes it easier


504
00:24:33,526 --> 00:24:36,126
to show the selection color,
to see the selection color,


505
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,166
but there's another reason


506
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,666
for using a thicker
or filled in shape.


507
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:43,846
So let's take a look
at the clock app again.


508
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,706
Now we can all see, unless
you're sitting in the back,


509
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,806
that the world's
clock is selected.


510
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:51,146
It's very obvious right?


511
00:24:51,146 --> 00:24:54,316
Well let's say we
didn't have enough time


512
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:57,276
to design a totally different
set of icons for the active


513
00:24:57,276 --> 00:25:01,576
or selected state, so instead,
we just use the off state,


514
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:05,146
but we tinted it red, and we
put that into the interface.


515
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,936
Well, right off the
bat, you can see


516
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:10,116
that selection is
a lot less obvious.


517
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:13,726
And it's really not obvious
if you're color blind.


518
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,776
Now, just as a common practice,


519
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:18,326
something to always
remember to do.


520
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:20,216
Take screen shots of your app,


521
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:22,446
bring them into the graphic
design tool of your choice,


522
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:24,766
and desaturate them,
and make sure


523
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,826
that you can still clearly
see state and selection.


524
00:25:28,056 --> 00:25:29,916
This is a really
important thing to do.


525
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:34,846
With the filled in tab bar icon,
it's still at least possible


526
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:38,096
to see what selection,
if the color red looks


527
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,726
like gray to you [applause].


528
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:48,466
See. And even if you
can see every color


529
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,036
of the spectrum just fine,


530
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,996
using a filled-in shape
makes selection more obvious


531
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,176
for all of us.


532
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,896
This is a case of doing the
right thing for accessibility


533
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:00,266
and improving the
experience for everyone.


534
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:03,836
Next, navigation systems


535
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:07,026
that are intuitive
maximize continuity.


536
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,636
Now, in a profession,
in a world of UI Design,


537
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:12,866
we use this word
flow all the time.


538
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:17,446
And all it really means is this
is the experience of moving


539
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:19,176
from one place to another.


540
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:20,806
One view to the next.


541
00:26:20,806 --> 00:26:22,736
One state to a different state,


542
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:24,216
or section to a different
section.


543
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:30,356
And intuitive navigation
system is designed


544
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:35,656
to minimize disruption,
or maximize continuity,


545
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:38,416
by keeping people
oriented, as they flow


546
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,556
through the experience.


547
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:41,706
So let's take an example.


548
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,536
This is the photos app for iOS.


549
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:46,986
And here we're looking at a
grid of photos, and when we tap


550
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:50,716
on one of those photos, it
zooms up, fills the screen.


551
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:53,606
And this is really
important for usability,


552
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:56,186
because without having
to think about it,


553
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:58,896
you know that the
photo you tapped


554
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,906
on is the one now
you're looking at.


555
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:03,856
You get that instantaneous
confirmation, again,


556
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,026
without having to
think about it.


557
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:09,596
And the animation to go back
is just the opposite, reversed.


558
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:13,596
And this is also important for
the usability of the photos app,


559
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:16,836
because now you're back in the
grid view, and you know exactly


560
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:19,046
which photo you had just been
looking at, so you know how


561
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:23,106
to proceed forward or backward
from that specific photo.


562
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,446
Now, if this animation
had been done differently,


563
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:31,276
instead we tapped on the
photo, and the big photo slid


564
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,716
in from the right, we
wouldn't have the benefit


565
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:35,716
of that continuous experience.


566
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,836
We would have to remember
which, what the photo looked


567
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:41,176
at that we wanted to look
at, and then compare it


568
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:42,576
with the image we're
now looking at.


569
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:45,006
And the same is true
when we go back.


570
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:47,566
We have to remember what that
photo we were just looking


571
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:50,246
at looked like, and compare it
to the photos in the grid view.


572
00:27:51,106 --> 00:27:54,226
Now, this is a very simple
UI animation concept.


573
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:57,826
But it's a powerful one,
and it's used in all sorts


574
00:27:57,826 --> 00:27:59,536
of different iOS
apps that we make,


575
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:03,286
as well as on the
home screen itself.


576
00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:09,076
And, what's more, is we use
it all over the place on OS X


577
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:11,806
as well, for the
very same reasons.


578
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:22,016
Okay. The next tip is
about providing hints.


579
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:24,966
Provide hints to
people when they seem


580
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,636
to be getting confused.


581
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,946
This is the app, Sky Guide.


582
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,296
Again, also won at
ADA yesterday.


583
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,256
And it provides information


584
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,916
about the entire
universe, right?


585
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:39,266
You get to see detailed
information about Betelgeuse,


586
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:42,996
and countless other
solar bodies that exist.


587
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,476
Now, you may think
that the way you get


588
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:48,556
that information is just
by tapping on a star.


589
00:28:49,016 --> 00:28:50,096
That's pretty logical.


590
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,706
That's pretty intuitive, right?


591
00:28:51,956 --> 00:28:53,736
That's how you get
information about something


592
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:55,136
in just about any app.


593
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:56,876
But if you thought that,


594
00:28:57,246 --> 00:29:00,146
you would be 100 percent
completely and totally wrong.


595
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:03,536
The real way that you get
information about a star is


596
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,846
by pressing the i button
over on the right-hand side


597
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:06,506
of the screen.


598
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:09,566
But if that i button was just
sitting there the whole time,


599
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,076
well, you wouldn't know
what it represented.


600
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:14,006
You might think it's
just general information


601
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:18,226
about the app itself, or you
know, like the cosmos, right?


602
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:23,416
So to clarify that for
people, Sky Guide does a couple


603
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,006
of very simple things with
animation to help you out.


604
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:30,706
When you select a star,
when you select a star,


605
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:34,326
the i button fades in and
it pulses a little bit,


606
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:35,886
just draws your attention to it.


607
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:39,616
And when you de-select the
star, it just fades out.


608
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:43,646
And that gives you
this understanding


609
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:45,546
that there is a relationship
between the star


610
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:47,326
that you have selected
and the info button.


611
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,216
It's very effective.


612
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:50,156
Very subtle.


613
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,046
I mean you're not necessarily
even thinking about that.


614
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:56,286
And what's even cooler than
that, is that if you happen


615
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:59,616
to think that double tapping
a star will also give you


616
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:02,046
information about
the star, as I did,


617
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,286
then the i button will just
keep pulsing every time you tap


618
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:07,056
on that star.


619
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:10,436
So it's elegantly
redirecting your attention back


620
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:13,566
over to the i button,
because they can infer


621
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,306
by how you're interacting
with the app


622
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:18,056
that that's what your intention
is, is to get information


623
00:30:18,056 --> 00:30:22,216
about the star, and they're
retraining you, redirecting you.


624
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:26,976
Okay. And the last and
probably most important tip


625
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:30,506
that I have is that
less is more.


626
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:35,566
Picking between a smaller
number of choices is faster,


627
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:38,766
and easier, than picking from
a larger number of choices.


628
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:41,916
I told you I would say a lot of
really dumb and obvious things.


629
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:45,956
Now giving people too many
choices can slow them down,


630
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:47,136
and it can be intimidating.


631
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:50,196
You might think that
you're impressing people


632
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,786
who are using your app with
how feature-rich your app is.


633
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:55,506
But their takeaway
may be very different.


634
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:58,306
They may think that your app
is too much for their needs,


635
00:30:58,306 --> 00:30:59,596
or just too intimidating.


636
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:05,076
And when we see a long list like
this, I mean, we all know this.


637
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:06,436
We start to skim over things.


638
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:09,706
We don't want to spend hours
and hours looking at this app.


639
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:12,406
So we're just going to
glance down really quickly.


640
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:16,366
But when we do that, inevitably,
we wind up skipping over things.


641
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,656
And the things that we skip


642
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:22,756
over may very well have been the
things that we wanted to select.


643
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:26,226
Which means that if we're
skipping over the stuff


644
00:31:26,226 --> 00:31:28,026
that we wanted to
select, that the people


645
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:31,246
who are using your app are
not getting what they want


646
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:31,716
out of it.


647
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,666
They're not realizing
your app's full potential.


648
00:31:35,516 --> 00:31:38,156
And if you can't limit
the number of choices


649
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:40,556
that you're offering
to people, again,


650
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:44,706
use progressive disclosure to
help keep decision making simple


651
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:49,516
and unintimidating at
every step in the process.


652
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:53,096
Now, that's a lot
about navigation.


653
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,156
And I promise I'm going to
talk about other things.


654
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,796
But I feel like I
would be remiss


655
00:31:57,896 --> 00:32:00,966
if I didn't use this
opportunity to talk with you


656
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:03,196
about hamburger menus.


657
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:14,576
[Laughter & Applause] AKA
Slide out menus, AKA sidebars,


658
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:18,246
AKA basements, AKA drawers.


659
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:23,636
Now, these controls
are very common on iOS,


660
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,266
and on other platforms.


661
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:30,176
And I'm sure many of you here
work on apps that have these.


662
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,206
You guys made the decision
to put it in your app.


663
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:34,166
And I'm sure that you did


664
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,206
so with the very
best of intentions.


665
00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:41,966
And I will say that these
controls do a couple


666
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:42,926
of things very well.


667
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:46,506
For one thing, they save space.


668
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:49,636
So rather than taking up a
bunch of room at the bottom


669
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,126
of the screen for a tab
bar, you're just taking


670
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:53,986
up a little bit of area
in the top left corner


671
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,166
for the hamburger menu.


672
00:32:55,766 --> 00:33:01,806
And you practically have the
entire height of the screen


673
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:05,556
to show options to people,
and if that's not enough,


674
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:07,976
you're going to cram more
awesomeness into your app,


675
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:10,986
people can scroll, right.


676
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:15,896
But --


677
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:26,756
[ Laughter & Applause ]


678
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,906
this is-- I actually
haven't played


679
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,276
around with the latest version
of Xcode, so I really hope


680
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,356
that they haven't changed this,


681
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,286
I don't believe you'll find a
hamburger menu controller inside


682
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:37,786
of Xcode [laughter].


683
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:42,126
Now, typically we don't provide
design advice about the things


684
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:46,476
that we don't offer to you guys,
but I can't help myself, right?


685
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:49,386
I've had so many conversations
with people about this control,


686
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,106
spending hours and hours
and hours talking about it,


687
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,456
and you know, I think
it's important


688
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:55,666
that we talk about
it here today.


689
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,656
And again, I'm not going to
say that there's no place


690
00:33:58,656 --> 00:34:00,366
for these controls
categorically.


691
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:02,926
I think there are some apps
that could maybe use one.


692
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:06,956
But I will say that their
value is greatly over-stated,


693
00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:10,386
and they have huge
usability downsides too.


694
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:14,116
Remember, the three key things


695
00:34:14,116 --> 00:34:17,235
about an intuitive navigation
system is that they tell you


696
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,795
where you are, and they show
you where else you can go.


697
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:23,335
Hamburger menus are terrible
at both of those things,


698
00:34:23,676 --> 00:34:25,755
because the menu is
not on the screen.


699
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:26,846
It's not visible.


700
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:29,136
Only the button to
display the menu is.


701
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:32,795
And in practice,
talking to developers,


702
00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:34,676
they found this out themselves.


703
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:38,346
That people who use
their app don't switch


704
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:40,295
to different sections
very frequently


705
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:42,525
when they use this menu.


706
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:45,136
And the reason for that
is because the people


707
00:34:45,136 --> 00:34:47,856
who use their app don't
know where else they can go.


708
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,716
Right? They don't know because
they can't see the options,


709
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,356
or maybe they saw it
at one point in time,


710
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:54,916
but they have since forgotten.


711
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:59,086
And if you use this control,
you have to recognize


712
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:02,706
that the people who use your
app may not realize the full


713
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:04,306
potential of your app.


714
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:09,506
Hamburger menus are also
just tedious, right?


715
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:13,046
If you want to switch
sections from the Accounts tab


716
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:16,826
to the Transfers tab, all you
need to do is tap the button


717
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:19,646
and you're there instantly,
and if you want to go back,


718
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,056
you tap the Accounts
button, and you're back


719
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:22,976
where you started from.


720
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:28,366
Doing the same thing with the
hamburger menu involves opening


721
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,636
the menu, waiting for
the animation to finish,


722
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:34,526
re-orienting yourself, finding
the option you're interested in,


723
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:37,406
tapping that, and then waiting
for the animation to complete,


724
00:35:37,406 --> 00:35:39,406
getting back to where you
were before, and if you want


725
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:41,876
to go back, you have
to open the menu again,


726
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:46,426
go through that whole process,
and there you are, again.


727
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:50,836
It takes at least twice as
many taps to change sections.


728
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:52,716
Something that should
be very easy


729
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:54,616
and fluid is made
more difficult.


730
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:59,266
And the other thing the
hamburger menus quite frankly do


731
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:03,016
badly is that they don't play
nicely with back buttons.


732
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:05,616
Right? I've seen this a lot.


733
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:08,016
Back buttons are supposed to go


734
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:09,506
in that top left
corner position,


735
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:11,696
but instead there's this
hamburger menu there,


736
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:13,766
so people put the back
button right next to it,


737
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,846
but no longer does this look
like a back button anymore,


738
00:36:17,346 --> 00:36:18,896
it just looks like this
arrow which is pointing


739
00:36:18,896 --> 00:36:22,586
to the hamburger menu,
looks ridiculous,


740
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:28,156
and sometimes people recognize
that it looks ridiculous,


741
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:31,206
so when you drill down into
the hierarchy of an app,


742
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,366
the hamburger menu goes away.


743
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:38,666
Now it takes even more steps to
switch to a different section.


744
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:41,576
You have to go back up enough
times to get to a level


745
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,146
in the hierarchy of an
app to get to a view


746
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:45,776
that contains the
hamburger menu.


747
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:49,436
Now, sometimes people
will try to solve this


748
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:51,106
by putting the menu on
the right-hand side,


749
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:53,476
but that's not advisable either.


750
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:56,856
That location is a
really important location.


751
00:36:56,856 --> 00:36:59,876
Usually you can put some kind
of action there, you know,


752
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:03,196
like a plus sign to add
something, or an edit button.


753
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:10,146
And finally, the downside
of being able to show a lot


754
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:13,566
of options is that you
can show a lot of options.


755
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:16,096
Is that you will show
a lot of options.


756
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:20,876
The potential for bloat
and misuse is tremendous.


757
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,586
They allow you to add
all sorts of stuff


758
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:27,086
that your users don't
really care about.


759
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:31,486
Like information about the app.


760
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:33,316
Or version history, or credits.


761
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:37,066
I hate to break it to
you, but no one cares.

[ Laughter & Applause ]


763
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:49,536
And the other thing is that
people wind up taking ads


764
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:52,136
and special offers and
making them look just


765
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,306
like regular sections and
putting it in there too.


766
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:56,346
That sucks.


767
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:57,546
No one wants that either.


768
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:02,206

have a nasty tendency


769
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:04,366
to fill with junk.

00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:06,336
Okay, let's move on.

00:38:07,516 --> 00:38:13,746
[ Applause ]


772
00:38:14,246 --> 00:38:14,556
Thank you.


773
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,396
Okay, the next major
characteristic


774
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:20,736
of intuitive navigation,
or sorry, we're not talking


775
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:23,666
about navigation anymore,
intuitive user interfaces,


776
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:25,186
is that they are clear.


777
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:29,936
Now, this applies to the
information apps present,


778
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:31,936
and the functionality
that they present.


779
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:33,736
Information and functionality
need


780
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:35,966
to be straightforward
and understandable.


781
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:38,216
It's easy for people to do
things, so they're not trying


782
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,776
to decode or interpret
what it is they're saying.


783
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:44,436
And clarity is this very broad,
but very powerful concept.


784
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:46,706
And just about everything
I've said


785
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:50,576
about navigation really boils
down to just being clear.


786
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:52,816
Is it clear where you are?


787
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:54,966
Is it clear where
else you can go?


788
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:56,976
Is it clear what
type of information


789
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,886
or functions you'll
find when you get there?


790
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:03,286
But clarity applies to so much
more than just navigation.


791
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:05,976
Now, let's start with language.


792
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:10,156
Now obviously, we rely
heavily upon the written word


793
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:12,046
to communicate with the
people who use our app.


794
00:39:12,906 --> 00:39:15,586
But how well do they
understand what we're saying?


795
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:18,876
It turns out that that's a
really hard question for us


796
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:21,596
to answer, and it's
especially hard to answer


797
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:24,286
that question before
they've even had a chance


798
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:25,446
to use the app.


799
00:39:26,306 --> 00:39:28,666
But there are a few
things that you can do


800
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,316
to increase the likelihood
that you're speaking


801
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:33,446
and communicating as
clearly as possible.


802
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:38,446
Now, here are six ways that you
can be sure that you're being


803
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:44,376
as clear as possible, starting
with using simple words.


804
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:48,216
Now if you're designing an app
for a large number of people,


805
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,076
avoid using big words


806
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:52,156
that people may have
trouble understanding.


807
00:39:53,286 --> 00:39:54,016
So here's you.


808
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:58,266
And this red circle, that
represents your vocabulary.


809
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,666
Now, you use words from your
vocabulary to write the text


810
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,476
that you're going to put
in your app's interface,


811
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:07,046
and that's great while
you're developing it,


812
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:10,506
but once you shift, along
come some other people.


813
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:13,576
And their vocabularies are
different than your own.


814
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,346
They may not be native
speakers of your language.


815
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,116
They may have different
educational backgrounds.


816
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,536
Whatever the reason is,
it doesn't really matter.


817
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:25,326
The bottom line is
that the number


818
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:27,666
of words you share
in common is limited.


819
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:32,436
So use simpler words that
most people will understand,


820
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:33,456
most of the time.


821
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:37,436
Those words, they may not
be as precise or descriptive


822
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,456
as you would like them to be,
but it's going to make it easier


823
00:40:40,456 --> 00:40:43,566
for more people to
enjoy your app.


824
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:47,146
The next tip is to avoid jargon.


825
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:48,646
People shouldn't need


826
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,066
to be computer scientists
to use an app.


827
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:55,216
So, for example, we
say airplane mode.


828
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,816
We don't say turn off radios.


829
00:40:57,226 --> 00:41:00,466
Now, turn, off, radios,
those are really basic words,


830
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:03,766
but most people don't
understand what radios mean


831
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:04,526
in this context.


832
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:06,386
They just think it's like
the AM/FM radio they have


833
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:06,896
in their house.


834
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:09,356
So we use airplane mode.


835
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:10,706
It's much more effective.


836
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:13,666
And this isn't just about
computer mumbo-jumbo,


837
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:15,536
this is kind of about
everything.


838
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:19,296
So let's just say we're making
an app about renewable energy,


839
00:41:19,626 --> 00:41:23,646
and this app is intended to be
used by people who own houses,


840
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:26,416
or office buildings or what
have you, and they're interested


841
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,306
in doing the right thing
for the environment


842
00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:29,696
or just saving money.


843
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,946
They're not necessarily
really well informed about all


844
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:35,666
of the technologies that
they can choose from.


845
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:41,376
Now, they shouldn't need to know
what a photovoltaic module is.


846
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:44,666
They're going to say
solar panels, right?


847
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:48,596
Photovoltaic what now?


848
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:54,446
Right? A better design is one
that leads with solar panels,


849
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:58,766
leads with the commonplace term,
and if you want to define it


850
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:00,396
for people, that's great.


851
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:02,266
You're educating them, right?


852
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:05,226
Well, it's kind of synonymous
with photovoltaic modules.


853
00:42:05,726 --> 00:42:07,986
So now, when that individual
goes somewhere else and they see


854
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,176
that term, well they're
going to know what it means.


855
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:14,056
But there is a bit of
a qualification here.


856
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:18,536
And that is that it's
critical to know your audience.


857
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:21,906
So in this scenario, we
were designing an app


858
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,896
which is targeted at a consumer.


859
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:27,236
That someone is, it's a
large audience of people


860
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:28,146
who I described, right?


861
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:31,726
And we don't know
what they know.


862
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,616
And they probably can't
take anything for granted.


863
00:42:33,946 --> 00:42:35,636
So we want to use a
term like solar panels.


864
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:38,876
But imagine we were designing
an app which was to be used


865
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,886
by the technicians, the people


866
00:42:40,886 --> 00:42:43,636
who install solar
panels in people's homes.


867
00:42:44,576 --> 00:42:45,316
Well, they're probably going


868
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:47,696
to be a lot better informed
about the technology.


869
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:51,256
Maybe they intuitively or just
naturally would use the word


870
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:52,446
photovoltaic modules.


871
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:53,406
It's more precise.


872
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:55,956
In fact, they would be
embarrassed to use an app


873
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:57,516
which says solar panels.


874
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:58,886
They wouldn't want
to be caught dead--


875
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:00,586
they'd be laughed at
by their colleagues.


876
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:03,676
So think about your app.


877
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:07,936
Now there's a spectrum, and
it's important to consider,


878
00:43:08,476 --> 00:43:11,186
are you're targeting a
consumer or a professional?


879
00:43:12,186 --> 00:43:16,486
Correctly positioning your app
on that spectrum is the key


880
00:43:17,226 --> 00:43:19,886
to making sure that
your app is intuitive


881
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:21,966
for the audience
who is using it.


882
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:25,836
Now, the next tip is
about being descriptive.


883
00:43:27,476 --> 00:43:29,466
So sometimes I see this.


884
00:43:30,056 --> 00:43:31,136
There's an option
that says Home.


885
00:43:31,136 --> 00:43:33,876
Well what's on the Home screen?


886
00:43:33,936 --> 00:43:35,136
I have no idea.


887
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,546
Home is very undescriptive.


888
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:41,496
In fact, it always
suggests to me


889
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,246
that the person designing
the app probably comes


890
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,476
from a web design background.


891
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:48,866
On iOS, we try to be really
descriptive about what kind


892
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:51,856
of content or functionality
you would find on that screen.


893
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:54,946
So use better words that
are more descriptive.


894
00:43:56,446 --> 00:43:59,346
And next, be succinct.


895
00:44:00,616 --> 00:44:02,086
Brevity is a virtue.


896
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:06,126
Next, avoid truncation
[Applause].


897
00:44:11,856 --> 00:44:15,356
It's really hard to read text
when it's not all visible


898
00:44:15,356 --> 00:44:18,506
on the screen at
one point in time.


899
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:22,406
Being succinct, and using
shorter words will help.


900
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:28,456
And finally, you could have the
best copy in the whole world,


901
00:44:28,526 --> 00:44:29,776
I mean, beautiful prose.


902
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:31,916
But it won't do you much good


903
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,886
if people are having a
hard time reading it.


904
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:37,046
So use a type face
which is legible.


905
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:41,366
And make sure that text is
large enough for people to read


906
00:44:41,686 --> 00:44:43,416
at a comfortable
viewing distance.


907
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:46,086
Not with their face
pressed against the device


908
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,746
or the computer screen.


909
00:44:48,546 --> 00:44:51,606
And if you're making an
iOS app, I highly recommend


910
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:52,956
that you use dynamic type.


911
00:44:53,786 --> 00:44:57,346
This will pretty much assure
that text will be as legible


912
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,286
as our built-in apps,
and for those people


913
00:45:00,286 --> 00:45:03,086
who have a hard time
reading, have bad eyesight,


914
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:06,966
well they can adjust font size
to suit their individual needs.


915
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:12,156
Now, just as important
as speaking clearly


916
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:15,986
with words is communicating
clearly with visual symbols.


917
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:20,506
In fact, a well-designed icon
can often communicate a concept


918
00:45:20,506 --> 00:45:24,596
more quickly and more
effectively than any word can.


919
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:27,026
But icons are really
tricky to get right.


920
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,086
I mean, what does
this icon mean, right?


921
00:45:30,086 --> 00:45:31,216
It means nothing.


922
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:33,516
I mean, if I just saw this,
I would think maybe it's


923
00:45:33,516 --> 00:45:38,256
like a beach ball floating in
a fish tank, or it's a dish


924
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:42,096
in a dish rack, or it's like
a super modern door knocker.


925
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,666
Right? Without any context, I
have no idea what this means.


926
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,196
This is a terrible icon.


927
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,396
So what kind of icons
will work well?


928
00:45:51,696 --> 00:45:54,616
Well, there's some icons
which are successful


929
00:45:54,616 --> 00:45:57,396
because they're internationally
recognizable,


930
00:45:57,586 --> 00:45:59,106
such as this information sign.


931
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:05,076
We've seen information signs in
museums, in malls, and airports,


932
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:06,656
and we always know
what they mean.


933
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:08,666
It means getting
information about something.


934
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:13,746
Next, there's symbols which
are so pervasively used


935
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:16,646
in so many types of apps,
like this magnifying glass,


936
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:19,106
that we understand what
it's trying to tell us.


937
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,996
We know that this
relates to searching.


938
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:25,936
Even if the particular
form of searching may vary.


939
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:31,006
And next, there's icons
that are successful


940
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:34,286
because they represent
these real ordinary,


941
00:46:34,286 --> 00:46:37,776
commonplace objects that
we've all used in our lives.


942
00:46:38,456 --> 00:46:39,896
We've all owned an alarm clock,


943
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:41,786
or we've at least
seen one on TV.


944
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:45,306
So when we see this icon that
looks like an alarm clock,


945
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:47,486
we know what it's trying
to communicate to us.


946
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:50,226
So let's flip this around a bit.


947
00:46:50,826 --> 00:46:52,756
What types of icons
don't work well?


948
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:58,246
Well if your icon needs a label
in order to be understandable,


949
00:46:59,036 --> 00:47:00,286
that's a really bad sign.


950
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:04,796
If your icon represents
a commonplace object


951
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:11,646
that many people have never seen
in their life, that's a problem.


952
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:19,576
And if you use a
really common icon,


953
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:23,346
but in a very non-standard,
unconventional way,


954
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:28,016
then it's time to go back to the
drawing board, and start over.


955
00:47:29,086 --> 00:47:32,386
And also if you ever
catch yourself or someone


956
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:35,796
around you says, "Well it
may not be perfectly clear,


957
00:47:36,316 --> 00:47:39,376
but people will learn what it
means eventually," then I'd


958
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:43,026
like all of you people to
meet me over here after,


959
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,826
because I have this
awesome bridge


960
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:46,646
that I'd very much
like to sell you.


961
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:49,886
Look, it's not that
icons can't be learned.


962
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:54,126
It's just that they're
not likely to be learned.


963
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:56,176
Why would I find out
what an icon does


964
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:57,076
if I don't know what it means?


965
00:47:57,076 --> 00:47:58,676
Why would I even tap
on it or click it?


966
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:00,876
Maybe it's going to do
something destructive?


967
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:04,586
And anyway, that's a really
low bar to set for yourself.


968
00:48:05,106 --> 00:48:08,256
If you want to make a truly
intuitive app, don't settle


969
00:48:08,316 --> 00:48:10,966
for icons that need
to be learned.


970
00:48:11,486 --> 00:48:15,656
And I also want to mention
that icons are often used


971
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:17,476
because space is limited.


972
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:20,606
So they wind up being
kind of small.


973
00:48:20,646 --> 00:48:25,496
So let's say we're making
an icon of a coffee cup.


974
00:48:26,476 --> 00:48:30,366
And when we're making it, we're
using like a vector design tool,


975
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,966
and we're zoomed
into 3200 percent,


976
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:36,846
and we want to really get
creative with this, so yeah,


977
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:39,196
it's coffee, but you know,
it's hot coffee, so we're going


978
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:41,856
to add a little bit of steam,
and we want people to know


979
00:48:41,856 --> 00:48:43,426
that if they happen
to tip the coffee cup,


980
00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:45,436
it's going to be okay
because there's a saucer


981
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:49,326
that will catch all the coffee,
and you know, who likes boring,


982
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,626
blank vanilla coffee
mugs, right?


983
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:53,796
They often have pictures
and logos on them,


984
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:57,226
and coffee makes us happy, so
let's put a happy face on it.


985
00:48:57,996 --> 00:49:00,726
But then when you display it
at the correct resolution,


986
00:49:01,936 --> 00:49:03,466
all that detail gets
kind of lost.


987
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:05,396
Becomes muddy.


988
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:09,126
So don't add all those details.


989
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,886
It's better to render
the same symbol,


990
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:13,956
but with less visual detail.


991
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:17,846
It will be far more
clear when it's downsized


992
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:18,886
to the correct resolution.


993
00:49:20,046 --> 00:49:21,036
And if that doesn't work,


994
00:49:21,476 --> 00:49:23,466
just try using a
different symbol altogether.


995
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:28,896
Look, it's not always that easy
to come up with a great icon.


996
00:49:30,216 --> 00:49:33,426
If you can't find a visual
symbol whose meaning is


997
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:37,086
universally, immediately,
and clearly understood,


998
00:49:38,036 --> 00:49:43,176
then just stick with text.


999
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:44,416
Now, pictures and words.


1000
00:49:44,596 --> 00:49:46,176
These are really key
and important ways


1001
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:47,826
of communicating information.


1002
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:52,156
But there's another tool in the
tool box that I'd like to talk


1003
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,136
with you about today,
and that's animation.


1004
00:49:56,086 --> 00:49:58,806
Animation can sometimes
communicate things far more


1005
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:01,076
clearly than either
words or pictures.


1006
00:50:01,996 --> 00:50:04,806
One of my favorite examples
of this is the focus


1007
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:06,636
and exposure indicator
in the camera app.


1008
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:08,576
This animation of the focus


1009
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:12,046
and exposure indicator says
three really critical things


1010
00:50:12,046 --> 00:50:12,766
very well.


1011
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:16,056
First, by first appearing
and then scaling down,


1012
00:50:16,296 --> 00:50:18,866
it's drawing your attention
to the object of the part


1013
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:20,266
of the image which is being used


1014
00:50:20,546 --> 00:50:22,976
to determine the correct
focus and exposure.


1015
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:25,326
And because it's
getting smaller,


1016
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:28,266
it's giving you this hint
that it's really precise.


1017
00:50:28,676 --> 00:50:30,876
Right? It's zeroing in
on a particular area.


1018
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:35,016
And then when it stops getting
smaller, it just pulses twice,


1019
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:38,306
which tells you that focus
and exposure have been locked.


1020
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:43,406
And then, it simply fades
away, which tells you


1021
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:46,296
that the process is
complete, and it's now okay


1022
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:49,516
for you to take your photo.


1023
00:50:49,706 --> 00:50:51,846
Ready? Set.


1024
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:57,596
And go. That's a lot of
information contained


1025
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,806
in a very quick and
simple animation.


1026
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:02,096
Let's look at another example.


1027
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:05,066
The animation when you key


1028
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:07,656
in the wrong passcode
on your lock screen.


1029
00:51:08,526 --> 00:51:11,246
Without saying a single word,
it just shakes its head no,


1030
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:14,446
that's not the right
answer, I'm going to clear


1031
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,956
out that gibberish that you just
entered, and let you try again.


1032
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:23,786
Okay. So the second to
last major characteristic


1033
00:51:23,786 --> 00:51:27,686
of intuitive user interfaces
is that they are simple.


1034
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:33,206
Now, the common element
of not overwhelming people


1035
00:51:33,206 --> 00:51:35,046
with too many options
at any one point


1036
00:51:35,046 --> 00:51:38,976
in time are using more basic
language to communicate


1037
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:44,316
with people, or reducing the
extraneous visual ornamentations


1038
00:51:44,316 --> 00:51:47,306
from icons, is that
the user interface,


1039
00:51:47,306 --> 00:51:50,086
and the user experience,
needs to be simple.


1040
00:51:51,226 --> 00:51:54,246
Now, let's go back to that pen
and paper analogy for a second.


1041
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:56,726
Remember, you were
in your kitchen,


1042
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:59,516
and you were frantically hunting
around for a way to write


1043
00:51:59,596 --> 00:52:00,556
down that phone number.


1044
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:03,396
And let's just say,
that just like before,


1045
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:05,006
the pen was sitting
there and the pad


1046
00:52:05,006 --> 00:52:07,876
of paper was sitting there
on your kitchen table.


1047
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:10,686
But there is also
some pieces of paper.


1048
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:13,286
And there was also some dishes.


1049
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:15,496
And your kids' toys.


1050
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:19,646
That pen could be right
there, but you don't see it


1051
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:21,346
because there are all
these other objects


1052
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,846
which are demanding
your attention.


1053
00:52:24,046 --> 00:52:26,116
Complex apps are like this.


1054
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:29,796
In order to do the most
basic and simple of things,


1055
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:31,726
you have to wade
through a bunch of things


1056
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:32,906
that you don't care about.


1057
00:52:34,316 --> 00:52:37,416
Simple apps take the
80/20 rule to heart.


1058
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,446
Now, there's a lot
of definitions


1059
00:52:39,446 --> 00:52:43,516
for what the 80/20 rule means,
one of which is that 80 percent


1060
00:52:43,516 --> 00:52:46,446
of people are only going to
use 20 percent of features,


1061
00:52:46,886 --> 00:52:49,576
or that 80 percent of the
time, people are only going


1062
00:52:49,576 --> 00:52:50,386
to use 20 percent


1063
00:52:50,386 --> 00:52:52,386
of the capabilities
of any given system.


1064
00:52:53,356 --> 00:52:56,686
However you define it,
it's pretty simple.


1065
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:59,546
Most of the time, most
people will use very little


1066
00:52:59,546 --> 00:53:01,506
of what you actually make.


1067
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:05,406
And however you define
it, the takeaway is this.


1068
00:53:06,006 --> 00:53:08,756
If you show people information
that they don't care about,


1069
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:10,066
or functions that
they don't need,


1070
00:53:10,656 --> 00:53:13,056
then all that stuff is just
going to distract them.


1071
00:53:13,706 --> 00:53:16,316
It will get in their way
and make it harder for them


1072
00:53:16,316 --> 00:53:19,576
to accomplish what it
is they want to do.


1073
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,376
Now, I've been showing a
lot of iOS examples here,


1074
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:24,106
and I want to talk
about Mac for a second,


1075
00:53:24,106 --> 00:53:25,636
and the context of simplicity.


1076
00:53:26,226 --> 00:53:31,356
Now, what does simplicity
mean for a Mac?


1077
00:53:32,036 --> 00:53:34,646
I mean Macs are very
different than iOS, right?


1078
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,986
I mean for one thing, the
screens are much larger


1079
00:53:37,986 --> 00:53:41,966
than an iPad, let alone an
iPhone, so there's a lot of room


1080
00:53:41,966 --> 00:53:44,556
to show all sorts of
controls and information.


1081
00:53:45,596 --> 00:53:47,456
And a lot of times, that's
what people really want.


1082
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:50,736
I mean, if you're designing
a professional application,


1083
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:52,966
that's a good thing right?


1084
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,096
Macs are all about
utility and power.


1085
00:53:57,406 --> 00:54:00,496
So Macs that are designed for
professionals take advantage


1086
00:54:00,496 --> 00:54:02,136
of this by offering
sophisticated


1087
00:54:02,136 --> 00:54:05,926
and advanced work flows,
and people use these apps


1088
00:54:05,926 --> 00:54:09,866
for really extended periods
of time, and as they do so,


1089
00:54:09,866 --> 00:54:12,936
they become comfortable in
managing all of that complexity.


1090
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:17,146
And when they become
comfortable managing complexity,


1091
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:20,606
other concerns come to the
fore, such as being efficient.


1092
00:54:21,496 --> 00:54:23,286
And efficiency is all
about availability,


1093
00:54:23,286 --> 00:54:26,356
meaning everything is in
plain sight, or within reach.


1094
00:54:26,936 --> 00:54:30,996
Okay. So that's a
good thing, actually.


1095
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:35,846
But still, keep in mind that
if you're not just designing


1096
00:54:35,846 --> 00:54:38,616
for professionals, for a wider
range of people, maybe people


1097
00:54:38,616 --> 00:54:40,626
who are just wanting
to pick up new skills


1098
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:42,376
and grow into that profession.


1099
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:46,846
Just new users are trying to
learn the system, you don't want


1100
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:49,236
to drop them into something
that looks like this.


1101
00:54:50,326 --> 00:54:53,946
Take the time to give them
this, and allow them to graduate


1102
00:54:54,036 --> 00:54:55,766
to something that's
more complicated.


1103
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:02,816
Now, finally, the number
one characteristic,


1104
00:55:04,396 --> 00:55:07,256
and that's corny, of
intuitive user interfaces,


1105
00:55:07,256 --> 00:55:09,156
is that they are focused.


1106
00:55:10,446 --> 00:55:14,376
Now, the design of
this pen is successful


1107
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,556
because it's perfectly
suited for the context


1108
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:18,926
for which it was made.


1109
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:22,726
It's a general purpose
writing tool that works well


1110
00:55:22,726 --> 00:55:24,236
in your home or in your office.


1111
00:55:25,306 --> 00:55:27,996
There's nothing about this
pen that's extraneous.


1112
00:55:28,636 --> 00:55:30,776
It's not made more
complicated by features


1113
00:55:30,776 --> 00:55:33,366
that people don't really
need all that often.


1114
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,536
It just serves basic
writing tasks.


1115
00:55:37,566 --> 00:55:40,036
There's no ability to
change the color of the pen.


1116
00:55:40,886 --> 00:55:43,566
It's not double-sided in
case one side breaks down.


1117
00:55:44,396 --> 00:55:46,856
It doesn't have any kind of
laser pointing capability.


1118
00:55:48,126 --> 00:55:51,946
All of those features would make
this pen needlessly complicated.


1119
00:55:53,146 --> 00:55:57,136
The design of this pen is a very
singular and focused purpose.


1120
00:55:57,846 --> 00:56:01,006
Every aspect of this pen's
design serves that goal.


1121
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:06,326
Its form invites us to pick it
up and to hold it comfortably


1122
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:07,826
with a couple of fingers.


1123
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:11,606
It's obvious how to
click open the pen tip,


1124
00:56:11,606 --> 00:56:13,656
and click it closed
again by pressing


1125
00:56:13,656 --> 00:56:14,696
on the button at the top.


1126
00:56:16,226 --> 00:56:19,526
It's obvious how to clip it to a
shirt pocket or a piece of paper


1127
00:56:19,526 --> 00:56:23,726
so that it's portable and
we can take it with us.


1128
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:27,926
In other words, it's intuitive,
because of the intense focus


1129
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,116
on supporting just a couple
of basic tasks like writing


1130
00:56:31,116 --> 00:56:33,116
and drawing, and being portable.


1131
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:35,456
It is uncomplicated.


1132
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:39,296
And therefore, it is made
intuitive to a wide range


1133
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,786
of people and a wide
variety of contexts.


1134
00:56:43,116 --> 00:56:45,866
But focus can also
mean designing


1135
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:49,266
to support very specialized,
or niche applications.


1136
00:56:49,726 --> 00:56:54,396
This calligraphy pen is
intuitive to a calligrapher.


1137
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:56,996
Everything about
it they understand.


1138
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,356
It makes total sense to them.


1139
00:56:58,546 --> 00:57:00,956
The shape, and the
nib of the pen.


1140
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:03,926
But if you're not
a calligrapher,


1141
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:05,856
and you pick this up, and
you try to write with it


1142
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,456
as you would think to
intuitively, as you would write


1143
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:11,686
with a pen, well the results
are going to be pretty ugly.


1144
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:14,676
You're going to have a lot of
slashes and holes in the paper


1145
00:57:14,676 --> 00:57:15,566
that you're writing on.


1146
00:57:16,136 --> 00:57:18,546
The paintbrush, it's
the same thing.


1147
00:57:18,546 --> 00:57:20,166
This is intuitive to a painter.


1148
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:23,846
But if you're not a painter,
you're going to make a mess.


1149
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:28,356
The design of these
tools is optimized


1150
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:30,396
for very specialized
applications,


1151
00:57:30,996 --> 00:57:35,506
and just like a pen, adding
any extra stuff would result


1152
00:57:35,506 --> 00:57:39,326
in a less successful and
a less intuitive design.


1153
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:46,286
The beauty of iOS is that there
are hundreds of thousands,


1154
00:57:46,286 --> 00:57:48,826
I mean 1.2 million
apps, out there.


1155
00:57:50,326 --> 00:57:53,516
And many of the most
successful apps are successful


1156
00:57:54,226 --> 00:57:58,006
because they do just one or two
things, extraordinarily well.


1157
00:57:58,596 --> 00:58:01,546
In other words, they
were designed


1158
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:03,986
around a clear and
singular purpose.


1159
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:12,516
Focus means that your app can
and probably should do less.


1160
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:16,816
If your app does less, you're
going to have more time


1161
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:20,896
to iterate, to prototype, to
implement, polish and test.


1162
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:25,026
If your app does less, you're
going to have less need


1163
00:58:25,026 --> 00:58:27,606
for complicated navigation
controls


1164
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:30,286
that are difficult to use.


1165
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:38,696
If your app does less, you can
spend more time crafting just


1166
00:58:38,696 --> 00:58:41,386
the right wording, or
picking just the right icons,


1167
00:58:41,786 --> 00:58:44,496
and making sure that you have
time to build in animations


1168
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:48,376
that clearly and meaningfully
provide user feedback


1169
00:58:48,446 --> 00:58:50,396
and help people to
stay oriented.


1170
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:59,826
Now, some of the best UI Design
advice that I ever received was


1171
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:03,416
that great software
starts small.


1172
00:59:04,016 --> 00:59:07,716
You pick something that you're
really passionate about,


1173
00:59:07,716 --> 00:59:12,026
and that is important to real
people, and you try to figure


1174
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:15,426
out what it is that you
can do to help make things


1175
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:19,056
in their life better,
easier, faster, more fun.


1176
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:21,076
More delightful.


1177
00:59:21,616 --> 00:59:25,646
And then you dive in.


1178
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:27,596
And you make that happen.


1179
00:59:28,096 --> 00:59:30,446
And you don't ship
until you have something


1180
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:31,696
that is truly great.


1181
00:59:32,896 --> 00:59:36,316
You don't ship until you
have something that you can


1182
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:39,526
and should feel proud of.


1183
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:42,456
If you've accomplished that,


1184
00:59:43,326 --> 00:59:45,766
your app will become
indispensable.


1185
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:51,356
People won't delete it, because
the function it provides them


1186
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:53,116
perfectly suits their needs.


1187
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:54,556
It's exactly what they want.


1188
00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:58,156
And the form of the app,
how it's been designed,


1189
00:59:58,436 --> 01:00:00,696
perfectly matches
the functionality


1190
01:00:01,026 --> 01:00:02,116
that it offers to them.


1191
01:00:03,636 --> 01:00:09,146
And perhaps most importantly,
people will sense the care,


1192
01:00:09,716 --> 01:00:12,816
the attention to detail,
and the love that went


1193
01:00:12,816 --> 01:00:19,806
into making a truly great
and truly intuitive app.


1194
01:00:20,086 --> 01:00:21,546
Okay. So thank you.


1195
01:00:21,546 --> 01:00:24,266
I want to point out
really quickly if you want


1196
01:00:24,266 --> 01:00:27,106
to continue this conversation,
here's my Email address.


1197
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:29,836
We also have a lot of really
great design resources


1198
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:32,426
for you available on
developer.apple.com,


1199
01:00:32,726 --> 01:00:35,036
including links to the
Human Interface Guideline,


1200
01:00:35,096 --> 01:00:36,146
a bunch of videos.


1201
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:39,656
We also have made the iOS Human
Interface Guidelines available


1202
01:00:39,656 --> 01:00:41,766
as an iBook, so you can
go out and get that.


1203
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:43,386
And I also want to point


1204
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:46,546
out that this is not the
last session about design.


1205
01:00:47,156 --> 01:00:49,966
We have three other really great
sessions for you this year.


1206
01:00:50,076 --> 01:00:52,286
I already talked to you about
the last one there on the list.


1207
01:00:52,556 --> 01:00:53,186
Go check it out.


1208
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:56,456
If you do internet purchase,
we have a really good session


1209
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:58,826
with tons of great,
wise advice--


1210
01:00:58,996 --> 01:01:01,486
content for you to follow,
and then this session


1211
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:02,856
in the middle is awesome.


1212
01:01:02,856 --> 01:01:05,426
It's about prototyping,
and how we use it at Apple


1213
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,746
to develop ideas, and really
refine them and figure


1214
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:10,286
out what it is we want to do.


1215
01:01:10,286 --> 01:01:13,096
Thank you very much for your
time, and have a great evening.


1216
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:20,100
