	   specified by the user's "Region Format" settings.  If you need to use an
	   alternate format internally, you can create and use NSLocales, e.g.:
	 
			NSLocale *enGBLocale = [[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"en_GB"];	
			[numberFormatter setLocale:enGBLocale];
	 
	   Doing so will not affect the current user-set language or region format.	 
	  
	   Similarly, while you should always rely on the system and application bundle
	   to pick the most appropriate resources for the current user language setting,
	   if you need to know what the current user language setting is, you can do
	   something like the following:
	 
			NSUserDefaults* defs = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
			NSArray* languages = [defs objectForKey:@"AppleLanguages"];
			NSString* preferredLang = [languages objectAtIndex:0];
			NSLog(@"Current language is %@", preferredLang);
	 
	   Note that the iPhone does not support locales in the same way that Mac OS
	   does (really only using locales for the Region Format settings) so if you
	   try and get an array from standardUserDefaults for the key "AppleLocale",
	   this will fail on the iPhone. */
