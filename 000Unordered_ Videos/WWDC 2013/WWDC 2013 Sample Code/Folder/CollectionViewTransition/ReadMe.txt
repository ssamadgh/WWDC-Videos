Collection View Transition
==========================

This sample illustrates how to create a custom transition when navigating between two collection views in a navigation hierarchy managed by a navigation controller. 

The application has two view collection view controllers that display images. The first is a stack view, the second is a grid view. You can transition from the stack to the grid by tapping on the stack. You can also use a pinch gesture, in which case you can control the speed of, and even reverse, the transition.
