00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,596
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:10,786
>> Good morning.


3
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:15,086
Welcome. This is our
introduction session


4
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,966
to using iAd Producer
to create content


5
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:21,276
for iBooks Author Widgets
and iAd rich media ads.


6
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:23,666
My name is Justin Voss.


7
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,506
I'm an engineer on
the iAd Producer team.


8
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,546
And joining me later to give you
some really great demos will be


9
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:30,756
my co-worker Chris Shull
who's also an engineer


10
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:31,626
on the iAd Producer team.


11
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:35,126
So here's what we're
going to talk about.


12
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:39,856
Like any good super hero, iAd
Producer has an origin story


13
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,386
and we'll share that
with you first.


14
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,766
Then we'll give you a quick
tour of the features of the app


15
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,066
so you can get an idea of
what's available to you.


16
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:52,936
Then we'll dive deeper and we'll
show you how you can create


17
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:54,816
interactive content
without having


18
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:56,706
to write a single line of code.


19
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:00,376
Then we'll talk specifically
about some features


20
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,126
that are just for creating
iBooks Author Widgets.


21
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,926
And finally, we'll wrap up by
talking about some features


22
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:08,776
that are just for those of
you who are creating iAd ads.


23
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,466
So let's get started.


24
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,886
The first thing I
want to talk about is


25
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:15,216
where iAd Producer came from.


26
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,476
And I think some of you,
especially those of you here


27
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:21,626
that want to hear about iBooks,
are probably asking yourselves,


28
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,476
"Why am I going to talk about
this thing called iAd Producer,


29
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:27,016
what do iAds have
to do with iBooks?"


30
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:28,096
It's a really good question.


31
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:32,236
And to answer that question,
we'll go back to 2010


32
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,946
when iAd Producer
was first released.


33
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:37,866
Now, iAd Producer was
designed to be a great app


34
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:41,336
for creating interactive
rich media ads for iAd.


35
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,916
And the interesting
thing about these ads is


36
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,426
that they're actually
implemented


37
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:47,606
with web-based tools.


38
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:50,626
So under the hood, these
ads are actually bundles


39
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:53,376
of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.


40
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,066
And so by virtue of
being a really great app


41
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:58,856
for creating these ads,


42
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,866
iAd Producer is actually
a really great app


43
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:03,646
for producing content
for WebKit.


44
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:07,496
So we've got this
app, it's really great


45
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:08,705
at producing content for WebKit.


46
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:11,086
And we looked around
Apple and asked,


47
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:13,486
"Are there any other platforms
that could really benefit


48
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,646
from having this
kind of an app?"


49
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:17,316
And it turns out,
the answer is yes.


50
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:22,986
So iBooks Author has a feature
that allows you to embed custom,


51
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:24,706
interactive widgets
into your books


52
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:27,696
and those widgets are
built with web-based tools


53
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:29,886
and they run inside WebKit.


54
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,976
You also might be familiar
with iTunes LP and Extras.


55
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:37,676
These are interactive album
liner notes and movie extras


56
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,566
and they're great way


57
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,466
to experience your
music and movies.


58
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,446
They're built with
web-based tools


59
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,626
and they also run inside WebKit.


60
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,776
So we realized that if we
could take iAd Producer


61
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,976
and tweak it just a little
bit, we could have one app


62
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,646
that can produce content for
all three of these platforms.


63
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,186
And with our latest
release of iAd Producer,


64
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,136
that's exactly what we did.


65
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:00,806
So now, we can use iAd Producer


66
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,356
to create these really great
interactive widgets for iBooks.


67
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,526
You can see in the
screenshot here on the left,


68
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:09,306
I've got a widget that I'm
working on iAd Producer and then


69
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:11,196
on the right, I'm
embedding that widget


70
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,936
into my book using
iBooks Author.


71
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:17,396
I can create iTunes
LP and Extras.


72
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:19,696
You can see here in the
screenshot on the left,


73
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:21,696
I'm developing an
Extra in iAd producer


74
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:24,146
and then I'm running the
Extra in iTunes on the right.


75
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:29,226
And of course, you can
create ads for iAd.


76
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:32,086
You can see here, I'm designing
a banner in iAd Producer there


77
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,686
on the left, and
then on the right,


78
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:35,986
that banner is actually
appearing on iOS device.


79
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,226
So we've got one app
that can produce content


80
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,586
for all three of
these platforms.


81
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:43,146
Yeah, thanks, yeah.


82
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,726
Let's get some applause.


83
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:45,586
It's pretty cool,
right[applause]?


84
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:47,846
Thank you.


85
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,826
OK, so that's the back
story behind iAd Producer.


86
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,876
Now, I'd like to give you a
quick tour of the features


87
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,986
so that you get an idea of, you
know, what's all in this app.


88
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,556
So when you first
launch iAd Producer,


89
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,366
you'll see our project
picker and this is


90
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:07,336
where you can choose what
kind of project you're going


91
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:08,936
to be working on
and you can choose


92
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,606
from one of our templates.


93
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,786
You can see at the top of the
window, I've got this tab bar


94
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,026
and that's where I choose
what kind of project I want


95
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:17,706
to create, whether I want
to create something for iAd,


96
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:21,266
iTunes LP, iTunes Extras,
or iBooks Author Widgets.


97
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:25,226
And below that, you can
see some of our templates.


98
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,586
Our templates are starter
projects that have a little bit


99
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,796
of structure already in them


100
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,186
so that your project will really
get off on the right foot.


101
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,986
We've got templates for
iAd like you can see here.


102
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:39,456
Here are some of our templates
for iTunes LPs, some templates


103
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:46,006
for Extras, and some
templates for our widgets.


104
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:47,936
When you go to create your
content in iAd Producer,


105
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,576
you'll turn to the Object
Library to find a lot


106
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:53,026
of really great prebuilt
views and controls


107
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,906
that you can bring
right into your project,


108
00:04:55,126 --> 00:05:00,106
and we'll talk a lot more
about this in just a minute.


109
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,996
Also, while you're creating your
project, you're going to bring


110
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:02,996
in a lot of your own images


111
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:05,376
and your own video
files and audio files.


112
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:08,056
And to import and manage
all those resources,


113
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:09,326
you'll use the Asset Library.


114
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:14,266
As you get more objects
on your page,


115
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,336
the Layer List can be
a really helpful tool


116
00:05:16,336 --> 00:05:17,606
to help manage all of that.


117
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:20,306
You can quickly navigate to
the object you're looking for


118
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:22,466
and you can rearrange how
they're stacked visually


119
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,106
on the page.


120
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,036
This is a lot like the
layer list you might find


121
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:26,466
in an image editor
like Photoshop.


122
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:31,826
When you add custom
interactivity to your project,


123
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:34,716
the Action List is where
you can find all the actions


124
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,646
that are applicable to the
currently selected object.


125
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:41,256
And then to customize the
objects you already have


126
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:44,276
on your page, the Inspectors are
where you can adjust all kinds


127
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,176
of things like giving
those objects names.


128
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,536
You can fine-tune their
position on the page,


129
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:51,276
and you could adjust a lot
of their visual properties


130
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,856
as well along with a
lot of other things.


131
00:05:53,276 --> 00:06:00,096
And finally, we have a powerful
but easy to use animation system


132
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:02,316
and this Action List sidebar is


133
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:03,886
where you can control
all of those.


134
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:08,036
You can create precisely timed
groups of actions and animations


135
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,026
and organize all of that here.


136
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:13,506
OK, so that's a pretty
brief tour


137
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,456
of the major features
of iAd Producer.


138
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:17,356
Let's dive deeper and talk


139
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:20,116
about how you can actually
create the interactive content


140
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:23,076
you're looking for without
having to write any custom code.


141
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:26,276
And it all starts with objects.


142
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:28,546
So this is the Object Library


143
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:29,886
that I just showed
you a few minutes ago.


144
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:34,216
It's full of a lot of
prebuilt views and controls


145
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:37,036
that you can bring into your
project, and they breakdown


146
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:38,116
to a couple categories.


147
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,796
There's a general category.


148
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:42,236
This includes all


149
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,636
of the standard controls
you might expect.


150
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,576
Those things like buttons


151
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,616
and image views,
labels, scroll views.


152
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,716
There's a media category.


153
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:52,386
This is where you'll find audio
players and video players.


154
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:55,936
If we scroll down a little bit,
we'll see the other categories


155
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:57,876
like the multi-cell category.


156
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,666
This category has objects that
are collections of other views.


157
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:05,556
So we've got things like a cover
flow view, we've got a carousel,


158
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,516
panoramas, image galleries,


159
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,766
a lot of really cool
stuff in here.


160
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:14,516
And finally, there's a dynamic
category and these are objects


161
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:16,986
that can be populated
with content at runtime.


162
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,416
So to give you an example,
there's a drawing object in here


163
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,876
where when the user is
actually running your project,


164
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,906
they can use their fingertip to
draw something on the screen.


165
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:26,426
It's pretty neat.


166
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,516
So now that you got your
objects in your page,


167
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,876
you want to start hooking
some action or some, you know,


168
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,536
interactivity up
to those objects,


169
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,896
and that will start with events.


170
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:39,966
Events are user interaction.


171
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,806
So an event might
be the user tapping


172
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,036
on a button or dragging
a slider.


173
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:49,246
And by listening for and
responding to these events,


174
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,066
you can get a lot of the
benefits of custom code


175
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:53,916
without actually
having to write any.


176
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,876
So let me give you a more
concrete example of that.


177
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,226
You can see in my
screenshot here,


178
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:00,646
I've a got a button selected.


179
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:04,766
And I've got a zoomed in
screenshot of our Inspector.


180
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,506
And specifically, we're
looking at the Events Inspector.


181
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,506
And this part that
says, Activated.


182
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,326
Activated is the
name of the event


183
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,316
that we're interested in here.


184
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:16,736
Activated is the event that
happens when the user taps on


185
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:17,666
or clicks on a button.


186
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,776
And in this particular
case, I've set it up so


187
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,506
that when this button
is activated,


188
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:25,006
we're going to run
the Go to Page action


189
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,446
which will take the user to
another page in the project.


190
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:30,616
And specifically, we want to go
to a page called Lander Game.


191
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:34,346
And so that's how easy it is
to configure a custom action


192
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:37,916
to be associated
with this event.


193
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,576
You're not limited
to just one action.


194
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:43,316
If you want, you can also
trigger an entire action list


195
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,796
so you have multiple
animations or multiple actions.


196
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:50,446
And if you wish, you can also
provide some custom JavaScript


197
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,066
code and when the
event is triggered,


198
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,936
we'll run that code for you.


199
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,156
We've got a lot of great actions
that you can choose from.


200
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:00,426
I want to highlight some of
the interesting ones for you.


201
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:03,046
We already talked about
the action that allows you


202
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,536
to navigate between different
pages within your project.


203
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:10,436
You can also control other
objects that are on the page.


204
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:12,396
So this is really great if
you have an image gallery


205
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,536
and you want to control


206
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,446
which image is the front
most one in your gallery.


207
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:20,116
We can play or pause
audio or video.


208
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:26,386
We can open URLs and
we can prompt the user


209
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:29,196
to compose content like writing
a tweet or composing an email.


210
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,686
So there are a lot of
things to choose from.


211
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:36,306
There's a lot more than what
we talked about just now.


212
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:39,426
We also have a powerful but
easy to use animation system.


213
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,716
So this is how you can create
all those fluid animations


214
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,316
that your users expect
from iOS and there's a lot


215
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,066
of different things that
you can animate about all


216
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,366
of the objects you
have on your page.


217
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:55,426
So for example, you can animate
its position, the opacity,


218
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,136
the rotation, and the scale.


219
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,786
And those are just a few of
the things you can animate.


220
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:07,996
There's a lot more.


221
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:11,256
So as you create these
animations or you want


222
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:14,346
to have more than one action
that starts as, you know,


223
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,086
triggered by an event,
you use action lists.


224
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,936
And these are precisely-timed
groups of actions and animations


225
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,556
and you can group them together
so that some happen together


226
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,666
or these happen in sequence.


227
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,036
You can mix actions
and animations.


228
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,556
You've got a lot of
really great options here.


229
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:30,766
So to give you an example,


230
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:33,666
you can see the spaceship
has this complex sequence


231
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,916
of animations it does.


232
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,026
One really great use for
these are page builds.


233
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,306
So the same way that in
this Keynote presentation,


234
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,876
all of these objects
are animating


235
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,436
on to the slide as it appears.


236
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:46,726
You can do basically the
same thing in iAd Producer.


237
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:48,986
So you can have animations
that happen as soon


238
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,126
as the user visits the page.


239
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:54,796
And to give you a demo of how
all these objects, actions,


240
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,096
and animations come together,


241
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,036
I'd like to invite Chris
to give you a demo.


242
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:58,516
Chris?


243
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:03,636
[ Applause ]


244
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:04,796
>> Thank you, Justin.


245
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,316
For my first demo today,


246
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:09,466
I want to show you how you
can build some really great,


247
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:12,066
rich interactive content
with iAd Producer.


248
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:16,416
Let's say that you're
writing a book about animals


249
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:20,066
and in your book, you want
to have an interactive widget


250
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,746
that has a cover flow
of those animals.


251
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:27,266
Well, I have built just
such a widget for today.


252
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,646
And let's take a
quick look at it


253
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,096
and then together we're
going to build it.


254
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:35,246
I'll use iAd Producer's built-in
previewing functionality.


255
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:39,766
And the first thing that you're
going to see is animating


256
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:43,886
in that big cover flow filling
up almost the entire widget


257
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:48,426
and it has the interaction that
you would expect from a widget.


258
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:54,226
The ability to swipe it, tap it
to jump to a particular image.


259
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:57,946
And there's also these two
buttons in the bottom left


260
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:01,006
and right hand corners
to let me simply cycle


261
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:05,036
through which image is
focused in this cover flow one


262
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:07,446
at a time, forward
and backwards.


263
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:10,286
So this is where we're heading.


264
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,296
I'm going to close this
now and we're going


265
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,166
to build it from scratch.


266
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,946
I'm going to build this
widget in four stages.


267
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:25,536
In the first stage, I'm going to
add that cover flow to my widget


268
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,666
and I'm going to
populate it with images.


269
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:31,016
In the second stage, I'm going


270
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,036
to provide some styling
to my page.


271
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:36,156
I'm also going to add some
buttons and style them as well.


272
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,536
In the third stage, I'm
going to connect some actions


273
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:44,526
to those buttons to make it so
that the cover flow will cycle


274
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,896
through like we just saw.


275
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,456
And in the fourth stage, I'm
going to add a little bit


276
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,656
of animation to my project.


277
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:54,536
So let's get started.


278
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,546
This is what you see when you
first launch iAd Producer.


279
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:01,166
We have those four
categories up at the top,


280
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:03,326
which project type
we're going to choose.


281
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,946
And today, we're going to
choose iBooks Author Widget.


282
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,526
Everything I'm about
to show applies to all


283
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,356
of these different
kinds of projects


284
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,936
but because we're writing a
book today, I'm going to go


285
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,076
with a widget project.


286
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,246
We also have all these
templates to choose from.


287
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:24,246
But I want to show just how
easy it is to use iAd Producer


288
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,886
to build content from scratch.


289
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:27,896
So I'm going to choose
a blank template.


290
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,586
It's already selected so
I'm just going to down


291
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,136
to the bottom right
and choose Select.


292
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,996
This loads in a new
iAd Producer project,


293
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,386
completely blank,
save for one page.


294
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,896
So I'm going to open up that
page to start editing it just


295
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:45,386
by double-clicking on it.


296
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,556
I want to get that cover flow
onto my page and to do that,


297
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,376
I'm going to open up
my Object Library.


298
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:56,226
There's a toolbar button for
that on the left-hand side


299
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:57,636
of the toolbar in the bottom.


300
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:01,046
Here, we see all those objects


301
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:02,816
that Justin was talking
about earlier.


302
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:06,976
We have our general
objects, our media objects,


303
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:13,626
our multi-cell objects, and
our dynamic content objects.


304
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:19,066
Today, because my cover-- my
widget features a cover flow,


305
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:23,296
I'm going to add a cover flow
to my page simply by dragging


306
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,366
and dropping it where I want it.


307
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,226
This isn't quite the size
I want so what I'm going


308
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:31,596
to do is I'm going resize
it by dragging on one


309
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:33,546
of the blue resizing handles.


310
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,936
You might be familiar with if
you've used Keynote before,


311
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:38,846
many other Mac apps.


312
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:42,046
Now, pay close attention here


313
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:45,546
because we also have these
great snapping guides.


314
00:14:46,556 --> 00:14:48,646
Yellow one you see there in
the center of the screen,


315
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:51,966
it's helping me make sure I
get my content just the way I


316
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:52,346
want it.


317
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:53,716
Extremely useful.


318
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:57,626
So now, I have it
the size I want.


319
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:01,016
It's time to get images
into this cover flow.


320
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,046
Before I can do that though,


321
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:04,946
I need to get the
images into my project.


322
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:09,656
I'm going to open up our Asset
Library panel by clicking


323
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:13,426
on the Assets button on the
toolbar and I'm then going


324
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,286
to click Import in that panel.


325
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,606
I'm going to navigate
to my photos.


326
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,756
And before I bring
these photos in,


327
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:24,986
I want to point out something.


328
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:28,546
For every image I have, for
example, this butterfly image,


329
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,236
I have a pair of assets.


330
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,516
I have my standard
resolution JPEG


331
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:36,746
and I have my retina
resolution @2x JPEG.


332
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,716
It's very important to have
a naming scheme like this.


333
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,246
This is what iAd
Producer is expecting.


334
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,976
And if you've done
Cocoa development before


335
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,466
for retina displays, this
should be familiar to you.


336
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:51,606
So I'm going to select all these
images that I've pre-created


337
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:53,906
and choose to import them.


338
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:58,086
And at this point, you'll
notice that that pair


339
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:02,536
of images is now a single
listing in our Asset Library.


340
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:06,056
This is because from here on
out, iAd Producer is going


341
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:08,116
to take care of the retina


342
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:10,766
versus standard resolution
displays and images for you.


343
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:13,176
It's going to make sure
the right image ends


344
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:14,136
up on the right display.


345
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:16,686
If you've done traditional
web development before


346
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,526
where you've had to deal with
this yourself, this is going


347
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:19,846
to be a huge time saver.


348
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:24,236
If you really want to make sure
you have both resolution images,


349
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,146
you can look up at the
top of that Asset Library


350
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:31,356
and you can see I have both my
1x and 2x versions of my image.


351
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:35,806
OK, enough about retina
versus standard resolution.


352
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:39,146
Let's get these images
in my cover flow.


353
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:42,786
So I'm going to select
all my images and drag


354
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:46,046
and drop onto my cover flow.


355
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:49,986
Just like that, populated
cover flow with all my images.


356
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:56,026
At this point, let's
take a second and see


357
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,066
where we are in our project.


358
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,226
I'm going to use iAd Producer's
built-in Quick Preview


359
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:02,746
functionality to get
an interactive preview


360
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:03,566
of my widget.


361
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:06,386
We do this with the
Preview button


362
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,925
in the center of the toolbar.


363
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,626
Here, I can interact with
my widget and you'll notice


364
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:17,656
that that cover flow has not
only the images we added to it


365
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:21,316
but has all the interactivity
that we would expect


366
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:25,736
from a cover flow, the
ability to swipe and tap.


367
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,306
Comes for free with the
cover flow, you don't have


368
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,166
to do anything extra
to get that.


369
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:34,356
All right, so I've added
my cover flow to my page,


370
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,206
that's the first stage.


371
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,276
Let's go on to the second
stage and style my page,


372
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:41,476
add some buttons, and
style them as well.


373
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,876
I'm going to close Quick Preview


374
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,186
by hitting the Close
button in the top left.


375
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,576
And I'm going to
deselect my cover flow


376
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,066
so that I can style my
page itself because I want


377
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,156
to change its background
to black.


378
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,156
So I'm just going to click away
from my cover flow by clicking


379
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:03,486
on the background of my page and
open up the Inspector in the--


380
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,976
by using the toolbar
button in the bottom right.


381
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,906
Here is where we can
set all the settings


382
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,686
about a particular object
or because right now,


383
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:15,736
we have nothing selected,
the page itself.


384
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:19,016
So what I'm going do is I'm
going to change the background


385
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:19,956
of this page to black.


386
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:22,366
I'm going to open up the
Background Inspector,


387
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:24,436
switch from None to Color.


388
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:30,236
I'm just going to click on this
color well and choose black.


389
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:32,386
There we go.


390
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,086
I think this is looking
a lot better.


391
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,146
Let's get those buttons
on the page.


392
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,336
Just like I did before with my
cover flow, I'm going to open


393
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,726
up my Objects Library,
scroll up to the top


394
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:50,206
and drag a button onto the page.


395
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,676
This one is going to
be my next button.


396
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,736
This button doesn't quite fit in
with the color scheme I'm going


397
00:18:56,776 --> 00:19:00,156
for with this page, so let's
change some of its styles.


398
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,556
You notice now that I
have the button selected,


399
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,936
the Inspector is the
Buttons Inspector


400
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:08,666
and I have all the options that
I can change about that button.


401
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:12,286
So just going to go through
and the first thing I'm going


402
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:20,096
to do is I'm going to change the
text to white and I'm also going


403
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:26,246
to change the background,
again to a color, and black.


404
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:29,596
I'm also going to tweak
the border of this button.


405
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,026
I'm going to make the width


406
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:34,286
of the border a little
bit stronger.


407
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:38,166
I'm going to get rid of the
radius and I'm also going


408
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,336
to make its border
white as well.


409
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,506
So here is how our
button is going to look


410
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:48,466
like when the user is just
looking at this page normally,


411
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,396
but as some of you may know,


412
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,666
buttons have more
than just one state.


413
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:54,326
They have multiple states.


414
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:58,836
So for example, when a user is
actively tapping on a button


415
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:02,156
and pressing down on it, we
often see a visual feedback


416
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,446
for that button so
that user knows


417
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,366
that they are correctly
tapping on that button.


418
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:09,706
We call this the
highlighted state.


419
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:11,796
So what I'm going to do
now is I'm also going


420
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:12,956
to change my highlighted state.


421
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:16,436
To do that, I'm going
to switch from Normal


422
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,046
to Highlighted in the Inspector.


423
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,936
We can see what that
button is going to look


424
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,796
like in the highlighted state.


425
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:28,836
And so I'm just going to quickly
change the styles for that state


426
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,576
to be something that's going


427
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,726
to give good visual
feedback to my user.


428
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:36,946
So I'm going to switch to this
from Gradient to Color again.


429
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:40,566
This time, I'm just going to
make it blue instead of black.


430
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:46,156
And I'm also going to make sure
that in the highlighted state,


431
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,876
the border of my
button is still white.


432
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:53,476
OK, now my button is
still labeled Button


433
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,546
and so the last thing
I'm going to do


434
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:59,106
to give this button the
correct visual appearance is


435
00:20:59,106 --> 00:20:59,736
to relabel it.


436
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:04,016
I'm just going to double-click
on the text and now that I'm


437
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,206
in text editing mode,


438
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:11,966
I can simply type
Next, just like that.


439
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,476
So my button happens to
be-- this next button,


440
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:18,146
happens to be nearly identical
to my previous button.


441
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:19,536
It just has a different label.


442
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:22,136
So I'm going to actually
duplicate this button


443
00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,906
so that I don't have
to do all that work all


444
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:25,696
over again to get those styles.


445
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:28,486
With the button selected, I'm
just going to go up to Edit,


446
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:32,786
duplicate, and there I
have my duplicated button.


447
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:37,706
Move it over to where I want my
previous button to be and just


448
00:21:37,706 --> 00:21:41,236
like I did before, to
label my other button next,


449
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:45,106
I'm going to double-click on the
text and change it to Previous.


450
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:51,596
So this is at my
second my stage.


451
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:53,936
I've gotten these buttons
down and I've styled them.


452
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:57,276
We'll take another moment and
check in with Quick Preview


453
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:02,406
to make sure everything is just
working the way I want it to.


454
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,456
You can see my cover flow is
now in that black background.


455
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:10,556
And while the buttons aren't
doing anything yet, they do have


456
00:22:10,556 --> 00:22:13,166
that visual feedback
when I'm tapping on them.


457
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:17,206
So the user knows that they are
actually tapping on the button.


458
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:22,916
OK, so at this point,
I'm halfway through.


459
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:24,616
I've added my cover flow.


460
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:25,936
I've added my styles.


461
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:30,136
It's time to actually have some
custom interaction inside this


462
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,566
widget so I'm going to add
some actions to these buttons.


463
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:35,716
Close Quick Preview.


464
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:40,526
I'm going to select my previous
button and now what I'm going


465
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,136
to do is I'm going to open
up the Actions Library


466
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:46,536
in iAd Producer by
using the button


467
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,946
in the toolbar on the left.


468
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:53,806
Here, I see all of the actions
that this button can trigger


469
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,936
when someone taps on
it or clicks on it.


470
00:22:57,136 --> 00:23:00,286
What I'm going to use today
is the Focus Cell action


471
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,236
because this is the action
that's going to let me,


472
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,146
when someone taps
on this button,


473
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,206
cycle through the cells
of that cover flow.


474
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:11,486
With this selected, I have this
plus button and I'm just going


475
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:15,296
to click this and before I click
it, I want you to be looking


476
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:18,686
at the Inspector for the
button because at the bottom


477
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:22,136
of that Inspector when I
click it, iAd Producer adds


478
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:26,896
in that Events Inspector
that Focus Cell action.


479
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:30,056
It's automatically connected
to my flow view and it's,


480
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,546
by default, set up to
go on to the next cell.


481
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,956
I'm actually going
to change this


482
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:37,136
because this is my
previous button.


483
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:40,236
So instead of going
to the next cell,


484
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:41,386
I'm going to the previous cell.


485
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:46,556
I'm just going to repeat that
process with my next button


486
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:49,576
so it also has that
action associated with it.


487
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:52,386
So I'm going to select it.


488
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:53,236
Once again, I'm going to click


489
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,626
on the plus button
under focus cell.


490
00:23:56,286 --> 00:24:00,146
iAd Producer adds that
to Events and this time,


491
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,866
I do have my next button here.


492
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,626
I do want it to go
on to the next cell


493
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:07,936
so there's nothing else to do.


494
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,836
Let's check in with Quick
Preview again and make sure


495
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:12,846
that I've correctly
rigged those buttons


496
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:14,936
to be just the way I want them.


497
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,846
Here, we have it and
not only are we getting


498
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:25,166
that visual feedback when I'm
tapping on the buttons but just


499
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,716
as we wanted, that cover flow is
cycling through those cells one


500
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:30,356
by one, forwards and backwards.


501
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:34,796
So that was the third stage.


502
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:37,866
For the fourth and final
stage of building this widget,


503
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:42,766
I'm going to add a
little bit of animation.


504
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:46,886
Closing Quick Preview and what
I want to do if you recall back


505
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,746
to that widget I showed you
earlier, I want that cover flow


506
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,656
to animate in from
the top into place.


507
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,836
So I'm going to select
this cover flow.


508
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,306
I'm going to open up
my Action Lists panel.


509
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:03,556
It's done by clicking on
the Action Lists button


510
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:07,186
in the right-hand
side of the toolbar.


511
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:08,166
You'll notice two things here.


512
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:12,116
In the Actions Library,


513
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,906
we now have a lot more
options to choose from.


514
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:19,076
We have a bunch of animations
and other actions that are,


515
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:21,666
will change the visual
appearance


516
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,256
of things on the page.


517
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:27,776
Now on the other side, we
have our blank page Appear


518
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,526
Action List.


519
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,866
And when we populate this,
this is going to be the series


520
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:35,006
of animations and actions
that get played back


521
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:38,566
when the user first opens
this page in their widget.


522
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:42,766
So in this case, because I want
to have a slide in animation,


523
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:45,236
I'm going to choose
the slide animation.


524
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:49,206
I'm going to click that plus
sign and that's going to add it


525
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:50,716
to my Page Appear Actions List.


526
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:52,946
You're also going to see
that iAd Producer is going


527
00:25:52,946 --> 00:25:55,976
to give you a little
on-canvas preview of what


528
00:25:55,976 --> 00:25:57,146
that animation looks like.


529
00:25:57,586 --> 00:26:02,246
I want this to be animating in
from the top instead of the left


530
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:03,616
as we just saw it have.


531
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:07,036
So I'm going to choose
instead of in from the left


532
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,406
in that slide Inspector,
I'm going to switch it


533
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:14,906
over to in from the top.


534
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,176
And even though we can
see that on the canvas,


535
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,836
I'm going to go one last
time into Quick Preview just


536
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,946
so that we can be dead certain


537
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,506
that this is exactly the
way we want our widget.


538
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:27,166
There we have it.


539
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,776
It's sliding in from
the top just like we saw


540
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:30,736
in that original widget.


541
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:35,406
And to recap, I have all that
great interaction that came


542
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:39,706
for free with that cover flow,
the swiping and the tapping.


543
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:45,216
And we also have those actions
hooked up to those buttons


544
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,166
to make it so that we can
cycle through which image


545
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:55,936
of the cover flow is focused one
by one, forward and backwards.


546
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:58,626
Now, everything I've shown you


547
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:01,646
up to this point
has been applicable


548
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:05,916
to all four project types
we support, iAd projects,


549
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:09,406
iTunes LPs, iTunes
Extras, and of course,


550
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:10,526
iBooks Author Widgets.


551
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:14,896
But because today, I am working
on an iBooks Author Widget,


552
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:18,216
I'd like to take just another
moment and show you how


553
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,646
to actually get this
widget into your book.


554
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,076
So to do that, it's very easy.


555
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:26,066
I'm just going to
close Quick Preview.


556
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:29,846
I'm going to choose
File, Export to Disk.


557
00:27:30,426 --> 00:27:32,576
You can also choose
Export to Disk Optimized


558
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:35,016
when you're doing your
final production export,


559
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,236
it gives you a slightly
more compressed version


560
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:38,346
of your widget.


561
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,246
But today, I'm just going
to choose Export to Disk.


562
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:48,396
I'm going to call it
Animals.wdgt, and I'm going


563
00:27:49,256 --> 00:27:53,746
to save it to my
desktop and export it.


564
00:27:57,496 --> 00:28:04,076
At this point, I can hide iAd
Producer and I'm going to open


565
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:07,736
up my book in iBooks Author.


566
00:28:08,236 --> 00:28:14,296
[ Pause ]


567
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,796
I already have a place
set out where I want


568
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,536
to have this widget right here


569
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:20,576
in the beginning
of this section.


570
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,386
So all I'm going to do is
with my exported widget


571
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:25,836
on my desktop, simply
going to drag and drop it


572
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:30,006
into iBooks Author
and just like that,


573
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:35,376
I have added a custom
interactive widget


574
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:37,876
to my iBooks Author book.


575
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:42,586
Under the hood, it's using
HTML and JavaScript and CSS


576
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,846
but you didn't have
to do anything


577
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,876
to get these great features.


578
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:48,186
You don't have to do any coding.


579
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:51,636
All you have to do is use
the great objects, actions


580
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,346
and animations in iAd Producer.


581
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:59,316
[ Applause ]


582
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:02,116
Thank you and with that, I'm
going to hand it back to Justin.


583
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:03,836
>> Thanks, Chris, that
was an awesome demo.


584
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:07,516
So there's two things that
Chris mentioned about that demo


585
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:10,716
that I want to repeat because
I think they are so cool.


586
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:14,956
The first thing is, is that all
the functionality you just saw


587
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:18,136
is all in HTML, JavaScript,
and CSS.


588
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:21,436
That flow view that
you saw is all HTML


589
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,046
and CSS and 3D transforms.


590
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:24,006
It's pretty cool.


591
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:26,506
I get to work on those stuff all
day and I still get blown away


592
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:27,786
by the stuff WebKit can do.


593
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:29,366
I think this is really neat.


594
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,076
The other thing that
he pointed out is


595
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:34,986
that all the things you
just saw, all those objects,


596
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:38,616
those events, our animation
system, you can use all of that


597
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,316
in all four of our
project types.


598
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:42,956
So you can use that when
you're creating rich media ads,


599
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:46,636
when you're creating you're
iTunes LPs, your iTunes Extras,


600
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,246
or your iBooks Author Widgets.


601
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:52,276
So it's some really great stuff.


602
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:54,336
So, now let's talk specifically


603
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,406
about some things
just for iBooks.


604
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,876
While you're creating your
widget, you're going to want


605
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:02,286
to preview it not only in the
Quick Preview that we have


606
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:05,366
in iAd Producer, but you'll want
to try it out on an actual iPad.


607
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:09,466
And to make that really easy for
you, we've created an iPad app


608
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:10,206
to help you with that.


609
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:15,146
It's called iBooks Author Widget
Tester and with just one click,


610
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,826
it will install right on
your iPad from iAd Producer


611
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:19,436
and will upload your
widget into the app


612
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:20,696
and you can start playing


613
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:22,736
around with your widget
right on your iOS device.


614
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:26,686
So you can run on your
actual iOS device.


615
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:29,366
But we also support
the iOS Simulator.


616
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:32,776
So if you don't have an iPad
handy or you want to try it


617
00:30:32,776 --> 00:30:34,746
out on a version of iOS
that's not installed


618
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:38,266
on your iPad, you
can do that too.


619
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,956
And for those of you who are
writing custom JavaScript


620
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:42,786
or custom CSS in your projects,


621
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:45,056
we also support the
Web Inspector.


622
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:48,536
And this works both on your
device and in a simulator


623
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:50,546
so that you can debug your code


624
00:30:50,546 --> 00:30:52,096
and measure the performance
of your project.


625
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,406
If this is something that
you're interested in,


626
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:55,866
we actually have
an advanced session


627
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:57,956
about iAd Producer
later today and we'll go


628
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,086
into this a lot more depth,


629
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:03,256
and we'll mention
that at the end too.


630
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,196
So it's a really great new iBook
specific feature that we've got.


631
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:09,536
So now, I want to change
gears again and tell you


632
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,956
about some iAd specific
features that we have.


633
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:15,976
We've got some objects
that are just for iAds.


634
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:17,926
One of them is this
WebGL object.


635
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,806
So you can actually
take a real 3D model


636
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:23,656
and you can embed it right in
your ad and we've got a lot


637
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:25,046
of interactivity
built-in for you.


638
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,576
So you can swipe through it.


639
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:28,356
You can pinch and spread
to zoom in and out.


640
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:31,806
This is really great especially
if you've tried to do WebGL


641
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,646
by scratch yourself, you
know that you kind of need


642
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:35,546
to be an OpenGL expert.


643
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:40,706
You don't have to be with this.


644
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,276
We also support embedded maps.


645
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:44,086
And these are the same
maps that you'll find


646
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:45,516
in the Maps app on iOS.


647
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:47,756
This is really great in
your ad when you want


648
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:49,636
to show the locations of
a business for example.


649
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:54,816
We also have a lot of actions
that are just for iAds.


650
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,686
So these are the things
like you can prompt the user


651
00:31:57,686 --> 00:32:01,646
to compose a tweet using the
standard Twitter compose view.


652
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:04,196
You can change the
wallpaper on the device.


653
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,906
You can save a ring
tone to their phone.


654
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,956
There's a lot of really great
things you can do in here.


655
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:10,026
There's a lot and I don't
have time to mention them all.


656
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:15,276
But one of the really big
features that we have just


657
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:18,006
for iAd is this feature
called iAd Blueprints.


658
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:22,496
iAd Blueprints are a new
kind of iAd Producer project.


659
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:26,886
We've seen a lot of ads and,
you know, there are some


660
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:29,386
that are more successful than
others and we've tried to learn


661
00:32:29,386 --> 00:32:32,336
about what kind of layouts
and what kind of events


662
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:34,646
and actions make for
a really successful ad


663
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,556
and apply those principles


664
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,346
to these starter
projects we have for you.


665
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,856
There's hundreds of
project to choose from.


666
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:43,036
We've got a picker here
where you can narrow it


667
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:44,326
down by just what
you're looking for.


668
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:48,126
When we open it up,
it's already prebuilt.


669
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:49,766
So we already have
a lot of pages.


670
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:52,706
We've got objects on those
pages with events and actions.


671
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:57,436
And when you're ready to upload
your ad to the iAd network,


672
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,806
we can put you on a fast
track to certification


673
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:00,706
because we already know


674
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:03,486
that these blueprints
work really great.


675
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:07,486
All you have to do is fill
out a streamlined version


676
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,266
of our Inspector interface and
bring in all of your own assets.


677
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:12,856
Every blueprint comes
with a spec sheet


678
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:15,166
that describes what kind
of assets you'll need,


679
00:33:15,446 --> 00:33:18,616
what file names they need to
have, what sizes they need


680
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,686
to be, what formats they
need to be, and all of that.


681
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:24,506
And to show you just how
easy blueprints are to use,


682
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:28,016
I'd like to have
Chris give you a demo.


683
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:28,556
Chris?


684
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:30,486
>> Thanks again, Justin.


685
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,126
So for my last demo today,


686
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:35,796
I'm going to show you how
you can accelerate your ad


687
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:38,516
development process
with iAd Blueprints.


688
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:44,206
So again, when you
launch iAd Producer,


689
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:46,416
you get our Project Picker.


690
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:49,776
And if you choose
iAd, that first option


691
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:52,396
for the project type
you're going to choose,


692
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:56,126
you have those four
templates to choose


693
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:59,116
from that are great jumping off
points if you're creating a--


694
00:33:59,116 --> 00:34:00,806
an ad more from scratch.


695
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,856
But if you want to
use an iAd Blueprint,


696
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:07,256
you can open iAd Blueprints
with this toolbar button


697
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,626
down on the bottom left.


698
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:09,956
I'm going to click that now.


699
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:16,216
And this is going to show you
the hundreds of iAd Blueprints


700
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:18,966
that we have precreated
for you to use.


701
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:23,786
Now today, I'm going
to be making an ad


702
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,156
for a fictional car
company and I happen


703
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:29,255
to already know what features
I want to have in that ad.


704
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:33,966
So I'm going to filter this list
of blueprints down to just those


705
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:35,536
with the features
I'm looking for.


706
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:40,275
I can do that simply by going
through this filter section


707
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,505
and ticking off the
things I want.


708
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:47,136
So in my ad, I know I
want to have some maps.


709
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:49,166
I also want to have
a product page.


710
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:53,545
I know I'm going to have
multiple videos in my ad.


711
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:56,315
So I'm going to tick
that checkbox as well.


712
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:59,886
And I'm also going to have
a calendar and a form.


713
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:03,706
This leaves me with two
options to choose from


714
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:06,626
and I know I'm going to have
three videos so I'm going


715
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:07,856
to choose that second option.


716
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:12,016
Just going to click on the image
for that one, and this is going


717
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,326
to let me see a little
bit more information


718
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:15,526
about this blueprint.


719
00:35:15,776 --> 00:35:21,716
I can also see screenshots,
sample pages filled


720
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:24,756
with placeholder content
so I can get a better feel


721
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,206
for what this blueprint
is going to be like.


722
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:31,476
It does seem to have all
the things I'm looking for.


723
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:35,556
So at this point, I'm going
to click on this blue button


724
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:39,516
up in the top right, to let
me use this iAd Blueprint.


725
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:45,236
[ Pause ]


726
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:50,836
When this loads in, you're going
to see the streamlined view


727
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,996
of iAd Producer for blueprints.


728
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:58,266
You're going to see that
familiar on the left-hand side,


729
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:02,016
Assets Library, and this is
where we have those spec sheets


730
00:36:02,016 --> 00:36:03,536
that Justin was talking
about earlier.


731
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:09,266
I can look at these spec
sheets by selecting one


732
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:12,096
and pressing the space
bar to Quick Look it.


733
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:17,116
And I can also share it or
save it to the desktop just


734
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:21,226
by selecting them and
dragging them out.


735
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:24,486
You also see underneath those
spec sheets all the placeholder


736
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,686
assets that I'm going
to need to replace


737
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:28,806
with my own for my car company.


738
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:35,566
In the middle, you see with
all that placeholder content,


739
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:40,046
all those pages already
built up, already connected


740
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:42,986
with actions and events under
the hood and animations.


741
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:44,916
They're going to make
your ad look great


742
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,646
but we still are going to have


743
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,796
to get that-- the
assets in there.


744
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,996
We're going to get back to that.


745
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,966
And on the right-hand side,


746
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:57,416
our streamlined Inspector
for iAd Blueprints.


747
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:01,056
Here, I can put in the
specific settings for my ad,


748
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,126
project title, banner
transition color,


749
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:08,376
and I also see the
setting for those features


750
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,336
that I chose earlier
when I was picking


751
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:12,016
out the blueprint
that I wanted to use.


752
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:16,296
I have my map settings, my
form submission settings,


753
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:19,636
and I also have my
calendar event settings.


754
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,826
I'm going to fill this
one out real quick with--


755
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:25,556
because I'm doing a car
company, a test drive event


756
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:31,976
and it's going to be
at 1 Infinite Loop.


757
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,186
And, of course, I'd fill out
the Start Date and End Date


758
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:40,326
with the correct dates
for my test drive event.


759
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:46,956
But like I said, the key to
an iAd Blueprint is creating


760
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:49,506
that custom look and feel
with your own assets.


761
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,916
So at this point, I'm going
to use the Import button


762
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:56,176
in the toolbar to
bring in my own assets


763
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,686
that I've already built
per the spec sheet


764
00:37:58,686 --> 00:37:59,666
that I showed you earlier.


765
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,306
Just going to navigate
to my assets.


766
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,866
I'm going to select them all
and choose to import them.


767
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,766
And at this point,
iAd Producer is going


768
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:16,976
to re-render all those snapshots
so you can see your pages


769
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:18,496
with your new look and feel.


770
00:38:19,026 --> 00:38:24,626
Let's take a moment now that
I have all those custom look


771
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:27,766
and feel snapshots in my
project to use Quick Preview.


772
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,466
Just like in my iBooks
Author Widget from before,


773
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:36,106
I can have a Quick Preview
interactive of my ad.


774
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,466
And there I have, we have
the option to choose--


775
00:38:38,576 --> 00:38:41,136
play those three
videos and I can also go


776
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:42,616
to the other pages in my ad.


777
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,686
Here I can see information
about my car.


778
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:48,416
It's looking pretty good.


779
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:50,836
So I'm going to close
Quick Preview.


780
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:56,196
But before I upload this
to the iAd Test Server


781
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,776
for certification, there's
one more step I need to take.


782
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:04,426
If you look in our Inspector,
after I added those assets,


783
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,956
I got this validation warning.


784
00:39:07,506 --> 00:39:08,996
I'm getting one warning
right now


785
00:39:09,236 --> 00:39:11,816
and to learn a little bit
more about it, I'm just going


786
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,056
to click on the error--
the warning badge there.


787
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:18,416
And if I take a look
at these warnings,


788
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:23,206
it looks like my product.png
doesn't have quite the


789
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,776
right dimensions.


790
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,906
I'm going to have to recreate
this in the correct dimensions.


791
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:34,336
It just so happens I've already
done this so I'm going to import


792
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:37,376
that corrected asset just
by going back to Import.


793
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,736
I have my corrected product.png.


794
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:46,706
I'm going to import it and
at this point, you're going


795
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:51,266
to notice that under Validation,
I have no issues found.


796
00:39:52,716 --> 00:39:54,076
So, we're looking good.


797
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:57,876
The ad has that custom look and
feel that we were going for.


798
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,986
We have no validation issues.


799
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,236
Let's upload it to
the iAd Test Server.


800
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:06,896
To do that, I'm just going
to use that third button


801
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:09,186
in the toolbar, the
Upload button.


802
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:14,036
And at this point, you'd
fill in the credentials


803
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,706
that your account
manager gave you.


804
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:20,666
Your ad would be uploaded
to the iAd Test Server


805
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,226
where it could be certified


806
00:40:22,226 --> 00:40:24,546
and then eventually
reach the network.


807
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:28,476
And just like that, in
only a couple of steps,


808
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:32,476
I've created a rich, interactive
ad that's really going


809
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,906
to get my brand across and
get people to my test event.


810
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,476
And all I had to
really do was plop


811
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,746
in a couple of custom assets.


812
00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:46,916
Thank you and I'm going
to hand it back to Justin.


813
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:47,476
[ Applause ]


814
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:48,076
>> Thanks again, Chris.


815
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:52,736
All right, so you can see how
streamlined the process is


816
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,216
for using blueprints to
create a really great ad.


817
00:40:55,846 --> 00:40:57,036
We've done most of
the work for you.


818
00:40:57,936 --> 00:40:59,946
We've got these great
prebuilt layouts


819
00:41:00,886 --> 00:41:03,236
but while you're developing
your blueprint, you might find


820
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:06,956
that the blueprint is 99 percent
of what you want but to get


821
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:09,726
that last 1 percent, you really
need to reorder those buttons


822
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:12,756
or you need to move that label
to different spot on the page.


823
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:16,356
Well to do that, you can
do something called Enable


824
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,326
Unrestricted Editing.


825
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:20,126
This is an option that you can
choose up from the Menu Bar.


826
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:22,486
You just go to File,
Enable Unrestricted Editing,


827
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,336
and this will convert
your blueprint project


828
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:27,366
into a normal iAd
Producer project


829
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,556
where you can edit all the
objects to your heart's content


830
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,816
and get exactly the
layout you want.


831
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:33,586
So these are really great.


832
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:37,586
Another feature we have for
those of you who were working


833
00:41:37,586 --> 00:41:39,856
on ads is an app
called iAd Tester.


834
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:43,336
This is an iOS app that
runs in your iPhone or iPad


835
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:46,326
and allows you to test out
ads right on your device.


836
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,806
So with one click, you can
upload your ad to your device


837
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:51,156
and you can try it out
right inside of iOS.


838
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:54,616
This is also really great
for testing the performance


839
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,786
of your ad as it downloads
over the cellular network


840
00:41:56,786 --> 00:41:57,986
which is an important
consideration.


841
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:02,126
It also runs in the
iOS Simulator so that


842
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:04,066
if you don't have a
device handy or if you want


843
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:07,176
to try some other versions of
iOS, that's really easy to do.


844
00:42:08,016 --> 00:42:10,196
And it also supports
the Web Inspector.


845
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,956
So that as you are measuring the
performance of your ad or trying


846
00:42:12,956 --> 00:42:14,926
to debug issues with
any of your custom code,


847
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:16,916
you can do that easily
with the Web Inspector.


848
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,986
And that works both on your iOS
device and in the simulator.


849
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:25,026
So to recap the things
we talked about today,


850
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:29,316
iAd Producer isn't just
for creating ads anymore.


851
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:33,216
We've got one app that
can produce great content


852
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:38,826
for three platforms, rich media
ads for iAd, interactive widgets


853
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,916
for iBooks Author, and
great interactive iTunes LPs


854
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:43,456
and Extras.


855
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:49,076
Our events, actions, and
animations make it really easy


856
00:42:49,076 --> 00:42:51,216
to do custom interactivity
without needing


857
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:53,386
to write a single
line of custom code.


858
00:42:54,976 --> 00:42:58,196
And our iAd Blueprints feature
makes it even easier than before


859
00:42:58,196 --> 00:42:59,406
to create a really great ad.


860
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:03,356
So for more information
about iAd Producer,


861
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:04,946
you can email Mark Malone


862
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:08,156
and his job title says iAd
Technologies Evangelist,


863
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:10,676
but he'd be happy to take your
questions about iAd Producer


864
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:12,136
and any of our project types.


865
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:15,776
If you have not already, you
should download iAd Producer.


866
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,456
It's a free download for
any registered developer


867
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:21,246
and the URL is here on screen
from developer.apple.com


868
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,446
and I encourage you to
download it, create a project,


869
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:27,236
put a button on a page, and
then preview it on a device.


870
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:28,986
And as you go through
that work flow,


871
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:31,006
I think that you'll see
just how easy it is to use


872
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:32,516
and how many cool things
you can do with it.


873
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:35,786
If you have any questions,
we have a section


874
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:36,966
on the Apple Developer Forums.


875
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:40,176
There's an iAd Producer
specific section


876
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:42,266
where you can ask questions
about all of our project types


877
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:44,076
and that URL is on
the slide here.


878
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:48,756
There's some other really
great sessions at WWDC


879
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:50,136
that you might be interested in.


880
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:52,476
If you want to learn more
about writing custom code


881
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:55,216
in your projects or to get some
really great tips and tricks


882
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,506
on debugging and optimization,
later this afternoon


883
00:43:58,506 --> 00:43:59,646
in this room, there's going


884
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:02,026
to be an advanced session
about iAd Producer.


885
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:03,726
We will show you all of that.


886
00:44:04,496 --> 00:44:07,266
And then on the other side
of the process for iAd,


887
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:10,346
if you're an iOS developer and
you'd like to put iAd banners


888
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:13,326
into your app, there's an iAd
integration session that's going


889
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:14,076
to be tomorrow.


890
00:44:14,546 --> 00:44:15,656
Thank you.


891
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:19,793
[Applause]


892
00:44:20,293 --> 00:44:23,930
