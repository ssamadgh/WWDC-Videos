join the campaign with us in

work for everyone too.


73
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:50,326
Because we inherently design for


74
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,166
ourselves, because we design to


75
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,076

But regardless, the next step of


83
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:08,386

155
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:24,016

and children with dyslexia.


157
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,076
Having multiple visual and

00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:29,896
auditory options help people


159
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,716

00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:41,306
society.


198
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,666
So, today, we're going to talk


199
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,486
about three areas of designing


200
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:46,146
for everyone.


201
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,626
Striving for simplicity, making


202
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,326
our apps effortless and easy to


203
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:51,756
learn.


204
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:56,026
Accessing perceivability.


205
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,766
Making sure our apps are


206
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:59,336
understandable through sight,


207
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,636
sound, and haptics.


208
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:04,446
And designing with integrity.


209
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,276
Holding ourselves accountable


210
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:08,026
for ethically making sure we


211
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,116
include everyone.


212
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:11,796
These are principles applied to


213
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,276
making great experiences,


214
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:14,166
period.


215
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:19,266
So, first if we think about


216
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,586
something that is simple to do,


217
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:22,446
we think of it being effortless


218
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:24,456
without difficulties, hurdles,


219
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:25,746
or cognitive strain.


220
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,426
But for something to feel simple


221
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:29,646
that does mean it can't do


222
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:30,626
complex things.


223
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:32,776
It just means trying to achieve


224
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,546
desired outcomes in the most


225
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:35,956
effortless and elegant way


226
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:36,596
possible.


227
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:38,986
Things that aren't simple create


228
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:41,156
barriers of entry to everyone.


229
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:45,996
As we go through our day, the


230
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:47,476
requirements of work and life


231
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:49,086
slowly drains our energy.


232
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:51,656
And when we are low on energy,


233
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,356
we have less energy to


234
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,176
troubleshoot tech and less


235
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,306
patience for navigating


236
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:57,286
something that should be quick


237
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:57,796
and easy.


238
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,476
At night, we rest and recharge.


239
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:06,206
However, were you aware that one


240
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,556
in six children in the United


241
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:08,746
States have a developmental


242
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:09,636
disability?


243
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:11,346
It ranges from mild


244
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:12,636
disabilities, such as speech and


245
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,566
language impairments to serious


246
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,366
developmental disabilities, such


247
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,026
as intellectual disabilities and


248
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:18,616
autism.


249
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:21,696
For people who have cognitive


250
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,486
disabilities and/or chronic


251
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,546
illnesses, they might start out


252
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,206
the day at three-quarters of a


253
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:27,536
tank.


254
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,686
And tasks take extra effort


255
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:30,726
throughout the day.


256
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:34,015
Plus, if you exert yourself all


257
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,885
the way to empty on one day, you


258
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:37,496
might start out the next day,


259
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,486
extremely low.


260
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,025
So, the apps that we make do a


261
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,186
great job at helping us through


262
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:44,626
our day.


263
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,706
Whether it's a convenience or


264
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,046
helping us to recharge.


265
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:51,046
They provide quick and easy


266
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,196
access to services, which is


267
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:55,296
extremely important for those


268
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:56,346
who may have difficulty


269
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:57,766
traveling outside of the home,


270
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:59,596
speaking a hearing on the phone,


271
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:01,826
or juggling work and home life.


272
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:06,026
For example, convenience apps


273
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,346
like Instacart, you can have


274
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,086
groceries delivered to your door


275
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,756
which alleviates the stress of


276
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,836
the supermarket, or allows you


277
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:14,686
to rest at home.


278
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:16,816
Or maybe it just gives you time


279
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:17,806
back with your family.


280
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:20,886
With education apps like


281
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:23,366
Doulingo it's incredible that we


282
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,636
can learn from the comforts of


283
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:28,046
our home, on our own time, at


284
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:31,716
our own speed, and with health


285
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,756
apps like Calm, they help us


286
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,466
nurture our mental and physical


287
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,166
well-being.


288
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:39,716
And with content creation apps


289
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:41,696
like iMovie, we can create and


290
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,676
share our artistry with friends,


291
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,996
family and the world.


292
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,526
So, apps play a key role in our


293
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:49,626
daily lives now.


294
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:51,906
And we can make even more impact


295
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,756
in people's lives by reducing


296
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,376
the amount of effort that we


297
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,726
require to use our apps, which


298
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,116
reduces barriers and provides


299
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,016
more access.


300
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:03,196
But this is easier said than


301
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:03,556
done.


302
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:04,856
So here are some ideas.


303
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,416
We should strive for our apps to


304
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,406
be easy to navigate by having


305
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,816
them similarly structured.


306
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:14,826
We need to be able to get


307
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:17,106
started and complete common task


308
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,636
without encountering any


309
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:19,996
barriers or issues.


310
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,616
And we should use UIKit as much


311
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,236
as possible to achieve the


312
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:27,086
consistent behaviors within each


313
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,566
app and across apps.


314
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,966
Because UIKit wasn't made for


315
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,006
just developers.


316
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,856
It's a design language for the


317
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,886
platform that everyone is


318
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:37,466
familiar with and knows how to


319
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:37,966
use.


320
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,506
And there are design resources


321
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,386
on human interface guidelines to


322
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,026
help you use the standard UIKit


323
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,866
components in your apps during


324
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:47,596
the design phase.


325
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,356
It's important to remember that


326
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:52,256
these toolkits support many


327
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,146
accessibility accommodations.


328
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,086
And if we can consistently use


329
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,496
standard UIKit interaction


330
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,416
patterns and components for more


331
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,446
task of our apps like basic


332
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,096
structure and navigation,


333
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,566
sign-up flows, account settings,


334
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,846
and sharing then you can spend


335
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,596
the majority of your time on the


336
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:14,116
parts of your apps that make


337
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:14,746
them special.


338
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,076
And making sure those parts are


339
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:17,966
accessible too.


340
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,226
Consistent use of our design


341
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:23,166
language is beneficial because


342
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,066
if you learn one app you have a


343
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:27,386
serious head start on learning


344
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,996
another because repetition


345
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,676
creates cognitive ease and a


346
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:33,766
comforting feeling of


347
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:34,546
familiarity.


348
00:11:35,086 --> 00:11:37,846
But we know it's not always


349
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:40,176
possible, to solely use UIKit.


350
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:41,326
There are times when you need to


351
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,546
do something unique and


352
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:44,626
original, but don't forget about


353
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:45,406
accessibility.


354
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,276
It makes you think more


355
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:48,636
holistically about the products


356
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:49,526
that you're putting out into the


357
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:49,856
world.


358
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,886
So, simplicity.


359
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,536
Building on what I know.


360
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,006
Making use of standard


361
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,486
components and familiar


362
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,266
interaction patterns to help


363
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,846
make apps easy to navigate.


364
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,436
Be laser focused in your


365
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,056
objectives.


366
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,726
Reduce any hurdles.


367
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,616
Help me get started quickly.


368
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:12,286
And it just works like I


369
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:13,936
expected it to consistently.


370
00:12:16,596 --> 00:12:20,146
So, our products need to be


371
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:22,086
understandable and perceivable


372
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:22,696
to everyone.


373
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,186
This means that information


374
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:27,046
needs to be available to at


375
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,196
least one sense; sight, sound or


376
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:31,156
touch that is available to each


377
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:31,606
person.


378
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:34,606
And we can look at our apps and


379
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,736
ask ourselves is it legible?


380
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,526
Is it audible?


381
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,956
And is it tactile?


382
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,396
But before we look at


383
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,506
legibility.


384
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:45,976
Let's escape for a moment to


385
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,056
this beautiful beach and


386
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,586
experience it in a few different


387
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:49,866
ways.


388
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:54,396
Relax, watch the waves roll in


389
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:54,816
and out.


390
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:56,596
Soak up that sunshine for a


391
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:56,936
second.


392
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,326
And if you have vision loss, you


393
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:05,136
might not get to see this in all


394
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,096
of its glory, but you're hearing


395
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:08,786
would be more sensitive to these


396
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:09,686
beautiful sounds.


397
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:15,806
[ Ocean Sounds ]


398
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:18,056
Or if you're colorblind, you


399
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:19,346
might see the world more like


400
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:19,606
this.


401
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:26,066
Or if you're blind, you're


402
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,076
likely even more in-tune to the


403
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:31,836
sound.


404
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,656
And these situations are very


405
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:35,066
real.


406
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:38,316
In the world, 285 million people


407
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:39,616
are estimated to have moderate


408
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,576
or severe vision loss.


409
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,946
And 39 million of those are


410
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:44,736
completely blind.


411
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,566
And one in 12 men are


412
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:49,286
colorblind.


413
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,326
And best estimates are around


414
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,696
360 million people in the world


415
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,226
have disabling hearing loss.


416
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:59,456
Not only can hearing and vision


417
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,856
loss limit people from


418
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,416
distinguishing information, but


419
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,236
they will also be seeing and


420
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:05,646
hearing your brand in different


421
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:06,806
ways than you expected.


422
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:09,916
For example, someone with low


423
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,066
vision may see their phones like


424
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:13,486
this.


425
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:16,086
And if you aren't low vision


426
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,836
yourself, you can simulate low


427
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,856
vision by using a small blur in


428
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:20,856
your design software.


429
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,376
Now, people with low vision will


430
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,126
often learn the location of


431
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,866
icons as long as they don't


432
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:28,176
move.


433
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:30,966
But content areas are different.


434
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,496
So, they need to maintain high


435
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:34,856
visual contrast to increase


436
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:35,636
legibility.


437
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,606
So, if you get started, you


438
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:41,536
should ask yourself is your app


439
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:41,986
legible?


440
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:45,296
Because maximizing legibility is


441
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:47,016
the highest benefit on being


442
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,146
able to comprehend information


443
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,416
because it's less work on us to


444
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:51,986
interpret.


445
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:55,106
For example, when we have key


446
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:56,996
information that is low in


447
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:59,946
contrasts because of small fonts


448
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:02,506
and low color contrast ratios,


449
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,376
or thin fonts.


450
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:08,356
It may be painful to read and


451
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:10,206
you experience cognitive strain.


452
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:13,866
So, a good place to start to


453
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,856
correct low contrast is to use


454
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,966
the default textile body for


455
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,496
your main content and a high


456
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,346
color contrast with your


457
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:22,936
background.


458
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,716
And then you can use bolder font


459
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,976
weights to emphasize text or


460
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,826
titles, rather than thin fonts.


461
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,516
And you can use filled in button


462
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,076
shapes so that the text contrast


463
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,646
is high, and the way forward in


464
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,126
your app is really clear.


465
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:43,866
And if you don't use textiles or


466
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,606
system fonts in your app, it


467
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:47,316
would be ideal to support the


468
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,216
accessibility bold text


469
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,356
settings, which requires you to


470
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,156
increase your font weights by


471
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:54,686
two weights thicker when the


472
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,446
setting is on.


473
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,256
Now, this is built-in with


474
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:58,636
system fonts and textiles.


475
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,616
The new App Store design does an


476
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:04,146
excellent job at maximizing


477
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:05,496
legibility through its bold


478
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:07,296
typography, prominent buy


479
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:10,566
buttons, large fonts, and high


480
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:12,586
color contrast colors.


481
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:13,946
Great job guys.


482
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:19,406
On macOS, there are increased


483
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:21,786
contrast settings as well, that


484
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:24,586
when on all active controls


485
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:27,506
become higher contrast by making


486
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,896
backgrounds opaque, button


487
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:31,716
outlines becomes thicker and


488
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:35,696
darker and system colors become


489
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:37,576
darker to create high color


490
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,706
contrast ratios.


491
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,646
So now that you know to look


492
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,176
for, let's look at the before


493
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:42,996
and after again.


494
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:44,666
Before.


495
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:46,766
After.


496
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,206
And even the ruled lines and the


497
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:52,176
color values of gray text


498
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:53,016
becomes darker.


499
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,726
You will need to supply these


500
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,316
same alternate designs, if you


501
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,876
do not use standard AppKit


502
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,176
because they will not come for


503
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,126
free in custom UI, but they're


504
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,726
extremely important for


505
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:04,915
maximizing legibility.


506
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:08,576
Now, the next suggestion to


507
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,945
increase legibility maybe the


508
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,326
most important thing to take


509
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:11,906
away today.


510
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,376
And that's to support dynamic


511
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,136
type, or the text size setting


512
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,756
because this feature increases


513
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,296
legibility by allowing each


514
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:22,175
person to personalize their


515
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,486
experience by increasing the


516
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:24,175
font size.


517
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,646
Or, maybe you need a farther


518
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,966
viewing distance if mounted on a


519
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,616
chair or propped on a table.


520
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,016
Because when our fonts don't


521
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:35,976
scale, people with low vision


522
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,576
need to use screen zoom windows


523
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:38,866
to read the content.


524
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:41,286
That's like having to turn your


525
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:43,126
light on, or your magnifier in a


526
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,066
dimly lit restaurant to read the


527
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:45,566
menu.


528
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,946
But except this is all day and


529
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:48,456
every day.


530
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:51,366
And some people don't bother


531
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:52,516
with zoom windows at all.


532
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:54,296
They painfully read the small


533
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:56,086
type or use their phones for


534
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:57,276
short periods of time.


535
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:58,406
And that's not a great


536
00:17:58,406 --> 00:17:59,036
experience.


537
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,356
So, if you adopt dynamic type by


538
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,486
using textiles and use the new


539
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:07,216
standard spacing constraints, we


540
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:08,596
can offer a larger reading


541
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:09,986
experience without needing zoom


542
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:10,416
windows.


543
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,476
And new this year in iOS 11 is


544
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:15,116
dynamic type support for custom


545
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:15,536
fonts.


546
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,276
Additionally, if you access


547
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,676
larger text setting via the


548
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:22,236
general settings, there's a


549
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,916
switch that enables even larger


550
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,586
accessibility text sizes.


551
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,586
And this year, in iOS 11, all


552
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,116
textiles will support these


553
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:31,906
larger settings.


554
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,306
So, this means that we need to


555
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:35,986
design responsive layouts to be


556
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,376
able to handle these large font


557
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:37,816
sizes.


558
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,806
To do this for our own platform


559
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,456
apps this year, a team of us


560
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,066
took a step back and developed a


561
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,916
few simple principles that


562
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,216
helped guide us through a


563
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:48,246
system-wide audit.


564
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:51,746
The first principle was to make


565
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,876
as much text dynamic as possible


566
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:54,836
and to support these


567
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,296
accessibility text sizes.


568
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,386
Next is make good use of the


569
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,436
screen width by wrapping lines


570
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,186
of type, rather than truncating.


571
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:07,316
And then, displaying the same


572
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,156
amount of text at the larger


573
00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:11,066
sizes as with the default UI.


574
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:14,336
And lastly, scaling glyphs that


575
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,126
appear next to text in content


576
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,476
areas so that the glyphs scale


577
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:18,926
with the text in harmony.


578
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:21,486
And when we look at all of these


579
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:23,156
together in practice it really


580
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:23,916
gets magical.


581
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:27,106
The mail screen now grows the


582
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:29,206
whole mail message to a zoom


583
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,926
level of 315% from the default


584
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:32,366
size.


585
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,056
And in custom layouts, like


586
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:37,056
calendar, this year we made even


587
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,716
more content scale like the


588
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:40,596
month grid increase in size,


589
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:42,286
where it didn't support dynamic


590
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:43,216
type it all before.


591
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,826
And at the larger accessibility


592
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:48,126
sizes, we re-laid out the event


593
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,786
row similar to the watch layout.


594
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,466
Because in the end, the


595
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,056
character count per line was


596
00:19:54,056 --> 00:19:54,916
about the same.


597
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,416
And it allowed maximum screen


598
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,356
width for text.


599
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:01,526
So, now if we turn on the bold


600
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:04,256
text setting and simulate low


601
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:05,836
vision with the blur, and


602
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,666
compare it next to the largest


603
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,236
currently shipping screen on the


604
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:12,496
left, now people with vision


605
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,016
loss will be able to use this


606
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:14,386
app more.


607
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:16,726
Thanks.


608
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,766
[ Applause ]


609
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,526
We've designed these responsive


610
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,736
layouts in most native UIKit


611
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:26,426
controls.


612
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,356
For example, like action sheets,


613
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:31,286
edit menus, and a keyboard auto


614
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:32,046
correction bar.


615
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:34,736
For elements like navigation


616
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,386
bars, toolbars, and tab bars


617
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:37,796
that would take up too much


618
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:39,016
space if we scaled them.


619
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:41,086
We added a larger representation


620
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:42,776
of the Fortis in a central hub


621
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,616
that you can get via Long Press.


622
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:47,556
And we also added larger


623
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:49,796
popovers for segmented controls.


624
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:53,266
And we've also extended larger


625
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,026
tech support to system spaces


626
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:58,506
like home screen app labels, and


627
00:20:58,506 --> 00:20:59,256
notifications.


628
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,696
Now, there are a few we missed


629
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:03,736
this year, but we have plans for


630
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:06,086
more and if you support iKit,


631
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,216
you will get these updates for


632
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:08,466
free as we make them.


633
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:12,236
So, maximizing legibility and


634
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:14,086
providing scalable dynamic type


635
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:16,246
improves visual experience for


636
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:16,756
everyone.


637
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,936
And alongside text that is clear


638
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:22,186
and understandable, same applies


639
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:23,576
for media and games.


640
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,516
All dialogue should support


641
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,636
captions because captions


642
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:30,286
display what is being spoken,


643
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,706
which gives more access to


644
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,126
people, whether you have hearing


645
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,006
loss, in a public setting, or


646
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:35,986
maybe even learning a new


647
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:36,516
language.


648
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:39,076
It's like trying to watch a


649
00:21:39,076 --> 00:21:40,926
video or a game intro with the


650
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,456
volume turned all the way down,


651
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:45,576
or trying to read someone's lips


652
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,756
that aren't looking at you.


653
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:49,446
It feels like you only get about


654
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:50,326
half the story.


655
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:53,986
So, apps like Kitchen Stories


656
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:55,626
have added captions to all of


657
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,736
their cooking videos, which is


658
00:21:58,436 --> 00:21:58,556
great.


659
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:01,616
OK so along with sight is sound.


660
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:04,626
You can ask yourself, are your


661
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,636
apps audible?


662
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:08,856
So, let's listen to a clip of


663
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:10,896
the intro design for Carlos V.


664
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,426
video again and listen to the


665
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:15,096
significance of the audible cues


666
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,646
of the app along with VoiceOver


667
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:19,326
that he's using to navigate.


668
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,756
Now, VoiceOver is a built-in


669
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:23,756
screen reader that speaks the


670
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,446
content on screen for people who


671
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:27,246
may be blind or have low vision.


672
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,536

681
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:53,016
>> So, we can hear VoiceOver


682
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,586
navigating the app.


683
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:56,346
The custom sounds of the apps


684
00:22:56,346 --> 00:22:58,986
messaging feature, and dictation


685
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,266
to input the message.


686
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,576
Altogether, this creates an


687
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,596
experience that is accessible to


688
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:05,146
Carlos.


689
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:08,406
So, adding thoughtful sounds to


690
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:10,866
app interactions helps you know


691
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:13,086
where you are, what you've done,


692
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,276
what you can do.


693
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,606
Plus, it's just delightful.


694
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:19,796
So, checking out VoiceOver in a


695
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,546
system is as easy as asking Siri


696
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:24,286
to turn VoiceOver on and off.


697
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,316
But if you don't know the


698
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:27,966
VoiceOver's like I have a quick


699
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:28,486
demo here.


700
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,486
I'll be swiping across the


701
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:32,336
screen to advance the selection


702
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:33,326
through some apps.


703
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:34,996
But then since I know that the


704
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,546
phone app is in my dock, I'm


705
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:37,996
going to tap the lower left hand


706
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:39,376
corner of the screen and then


707
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,946
double tap to open.


708
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:42,756
>> VoiceOver on.


709
00:23:42,846 --> 00:23:44,506
Mail. No unread emails.


710
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:46,946

712
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:51,466

713
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:54,816

714
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:55,476

716
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,816
Amy Frost iPhone button.


717
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,846
>> So, and there are tutorials


718
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,406
and documentation on Apple's


719
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:05,906
developer site to help you


720
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:07,436
become even more familiar and to


721
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:08,726
be able to support this in your


722
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:09,000
apps.


723
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:12,316
Additionally, if you have


724
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,926
image-based apps, we need to


725
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,786
allow image descriptions to be


726
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,586
added at share time by the


727
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,646
poster so that VoiceOver can


728
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:21,556
have something personalized to


729
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,026
describe the photo with.


730
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,406
Otherwise, new in VoiceOver this


731
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,586
year is image analysis to


732
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,056
describe the image contents or


733
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,626
composition, or if type is


734
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:31,836
overlaid on images.


735
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:35,136
But a handcrafted description


736
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:36,296
will always be preferred.


737
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,736
Twitter has done a great job at


738
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:40,406
adding image description options


739
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:41,376
to their Tweet sheets.


740
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:45,156
So, another area that reduces


741
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,996
hurdles and barriers for apps is


742
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:49,846
integrating with Siri.


743
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:51,886
Siri is the ultimate quick


744
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:54,466
access to your app that doesn't


745
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:56,806
even require looking or holding,


746
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,106
or touching the screen, with


747
00:24:58,106 --> 00:24:59,786
this voice activation and speech


748
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:00,166
input.


749
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:02,796
It's hands-free and eyes free.


750
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:04,926
I can control my home, send


751
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:06,526
messages, and even start


752
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:08,086
workouts quickly with apps like


753
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:08,516
Zova.


754
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:12,486
And also, new this year is being


755
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:14,336
able to type to Siri that is


756
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:16,246
available in accessibility


757
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:16,646
settings.


758
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:18,816
This gives quick access to


759
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:19,806
someone who may not be able to


760
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:20,316
speak.


761
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,896
Or maybe you're just in a public


762
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:22,336
setting.


763
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:26,716
So, lastly, along with sight and


764
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,156
sound, is touch.


765
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:31,026
You can ask yourself, are your


766
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:32,076
apps tactile?


767
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:34,366
On supported devices adding


768
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,126
haptics provides a way to


769
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:37,936
physically engage people through


770
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:38,456
feel.


771
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:41,036
It gets your attention if sight


772
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:42,366
and sound are not an option.


773
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:44,236
But also, provides an


774
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:45,676
enhancement for everyone.


775
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,876
For example, some


776
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,706
system-provided interface


777
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:52,056
elements such as switches,


778
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:54,036
sliders, pickers, index


779
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,936
scrubbers provide haptic


780
00:25:55,936 --> 00:25:57,166
feedback when we interact with


781
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,196
them to reinforce the action


782
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:00,046
that we're doing.


783
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:06,726
And a haptic on pull to refresh,


784
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,316
let's you know that you've


785
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:10,356
reached the critical threshold


786
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:12,606
between scrolling and refreshing


787
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,256
that shares a continuous


788
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:14,736
gesture.


789
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:20,466
And likewise, with swipe to


790
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:20,916
delete.


791
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:22,856
The haptic provides the critical


792
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:24,876
threshold of the accelerated


793
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:27,076
delete swipe.


794
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:31,136
And then another example is


795
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:31,746
Siri.


796
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:34,356
It uses a success haptic as a


797
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:35,906
confirmation that she heard what


798
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:36,416
you said.


799
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,886
Or Apple Pay uses visuals


800
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,876
haptics and sound with the


801
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:49,756
confirmation for the successful


802
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:50,266
purchase.


803
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:52,406
It feels the way it looks and


804
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:53,716
sounds, leaving me with a


805
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:59,156
confident purchase or payment


806
00:26:59,156 --> 00:26:59,223
[ding].


807
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:01,446
Now, that's clear.


808
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:04,706
So, to see if your apps are


809
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,236
perceivable, ask yourself is it


810
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:07,866
legible?


811
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,556
Can I read it?


812
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:10,696
Is it audible?


813
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,156
Is it usable without site?


814
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:14,096
Is it tactile?


815
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:14,946
Can I feel it?


816
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:17,386
Take one away, or even two of


817
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,646
these can I still understand it.


818
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,336
And so, now my colleague AJ is


819
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:24,726
going to talk about what they


820
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,366
did in the Maps Team this year,


821
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:27,896
applying some of these methods.


822
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:34,496
[ Applause ]


823
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:37,226
>> Thank you Caroline.


824
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:38,316
Good morning, everyone.


825
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:41,856
In Maps we collaborated closely


826
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:43,096
with Caroline and the platform


827
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:43,496
team.


828
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,166
And this year we put into


829
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,716
practice a lot of what she's


830
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:47,206
covered today.


831
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:50,396
Now, before we get into a few of


832
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:52,806
those examples, and think about


833
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:54,416
how to design with integrity,


834
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:55,976
we're going to take a short


835
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:56,486
diversion.


836
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:58,356
It's going to add a couple of


837
00:27:58,356 --> 00:28:03,086
minutes to our ETA.


838
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:04,826
We've used maps for thousands of


839
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:09,206
years to plan, direct, to travel


840
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:10,966
and to help us explore the


841
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:11,146
world.


842
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:14,496
And maps of the past, like this


843
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:16,856
one, beautiful as they remain,


844
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,376
were not accessible at all.


845
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:22,386
You can't zoom on this map


846
00:28:22,816 --> 00:28:24,916
without a magnifying glass, and


847
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,076
you couldn't orient yourself


848
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:29,156
upon it without a compass.


849
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:32,536
In face the only manipulating


850
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,226
you could do would be to fold


851
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:35,106
it.


852
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,766
So, as our understanding of the


853
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,086
world has improved, so have our


854
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:40,956
maps.


855
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:45,696
Today, your map understands


856
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,486
where you are.


857
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:48,286
It knows the direction you're


858
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:48,626
facing.


859
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:50,916
It knows the device you're


860
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,076
using, and it's equipped with


861
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,226
your individual preferences.


862
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,676
It's updated every day with new


863
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:58,236
information.


864
00:28:58,726 --> 00:28:59,626
And you can search it.


865
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:02,606
You can mark it indestructibly


866
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:03,716
and make it your own.


867
00:29:04,496 --> 00:29:07,166
It can take you places in real


868
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,866
time, avoiding traffic,


869
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,236
hopefully.


870
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:13,446
And in iOS 11, you can even see


871
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:14,286
inside venues.


872
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:18,966
The point is, today our mediums


873
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:21,316
are so versatile, they provide


874
00:29:21,316 --> 00:29:22,246
us with the incredible


875
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:22,866
opportunity.


876
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:28,336
So, when I joined Maps, I


877
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:29,606
remember thinking a lot about


878
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:32,236
how crazy it felt to see inside.


879
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:34,386
Like looking through a keyhole


880
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:37,866
and stepping through this icon,


881
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,526
I cannot have imagined the


882
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:40,806
operation I saw behind it.


883
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,116
I took it almost completely for


884
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:43,556
granted.


885
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:46,646
And everyone who uses our apps


886
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:47,306
are the same way.


887
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,726
They don't care how hard it was


888
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:50,176
to build.


889
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,746
It's not important that it works


890
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:54,846
for Johnny Appleseed or Jane


891
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:55,086
Doe.


892
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:57,766
What's important is that it


893
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:58,576
works for me.


894
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:00,506
Can I use it?


895
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:03,796
Imagine going to the movies.


896
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,016
You bought your ticket and your


897
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,266
excited to watch the film.


898
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:08,736
The theater's packed.


899
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:11,526
You get to your seat and there's


900
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:12,676
a pillar in front of it,


901
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:14,396
completely blocking your view.


902
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:16,986
I'm pretty sure I'm not going to


903
00:30:16,986 --> 00:30:17,946
come back to that cinema.


904
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,886
And I'm no longer just a regular


905
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,816
Maps user, not that there's any


906
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:24,326
such thing.


907
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,516
We're trying to build a map of


908
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:30,026
the entire world and it's a big


909
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,356
and diverse place.


910
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:34,286
Like you, I'm on a team


911
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:36,056
responsible for everyone's


912
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:36,546
experience.


913
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:40,766
So, coming back to simplicity


914
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:41,866
and perceivability.


915
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,396
Maps are not exact replicas of


916
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,026
environments.


917
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,176
Sometimes photographic detail is


918
00:30:49,176 --> 00:30:49,636
useful.


919
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,396
But most people don't find the


920
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:53,976
satellite view practical in


921
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:55,306
everyday life.


922
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:59,056
We use simplified abstracted


923
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,366
representations, designed to be


924
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:03,186
easy to understand and faster


925
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:06,566
for us to process to help us


926
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:07,936
orient ourselves more quickly.


927
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:10,456
And it's why we provide a


928
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:11,356
transit map too.


929
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:13,946
Where we suppress some elements,


930
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,196
like places or minor roads,


931
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:17,846
which aren't as relevant to you


932
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:19,146
once you're using transit.


933
00:31:20,156 --> 00:31:21,256
And we do all this for


934
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:21,876
simplicity.


935
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:26,176
And we make sure our maps are


936
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:26,896
understandable.


937
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:30,026
Visually, audibly, and through


938
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:30,886
haptic feedback.


939
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,556
We put a lot of care into


940
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:34,996
keeping the navigation screen as


941
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:35,956
simple as possible.


942
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,776
The most important information


943
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,346
available at a glance.


944
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,716
So, you can understand quickly


945
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,146
and stay focused on the road.


946
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,236
And while you're walking or


947
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:48,136
taking transit, audible


948
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:50,206
directions spoken clearly.


949
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,396
>> Starting route to San Jose


950
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:53,756
McEnery Convention Center.


951
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:56,976
>> Imagine if Siri mumbled these


952
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,106
instructions incomprehensibly.


953
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:01,526
Because isn't that kind of the


954
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,146
equivalent to small, blurry


955
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:03,706
information.


956
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:07,106
And on your wrist, while your


957
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:07,946
phone is in your pocket,


958
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,736
different tactic sensations to


959
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:13,366
inform which way to turn and


960
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:14,336
when.


961
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:16,336
Altogether for perceivability.


962
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:18,976
It's legible, audible, and


963
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:19,546
tactile.


964
00:32:20,016 --> 00:32:23,316
And you can use any one of these


965
00:32:24,586 --> 00:32:24,986
distinctly.


966
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,376
Integrity is something different


967
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:26,966
conceptually.


968
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:30,226
We do things for simplicity and


969
00:32:30,226 --> 00:32:31,516
to improve perceivability.


970
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,036
But we do things with integrity.


971
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,676
The state of being whole and


972
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:37,196
undivided.


973
00:32:39,216 --> 00:32:40,406
When we say someone has


974
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:42,056
integrity with think of them as


975
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:44,186
being honest with an admirable


976
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:45,026
moral compass.


977
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,066
So, when we consider that the


978
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,496
people who need our services the


979
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,546
most, might be the ones who find


980
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,846
them the hardest to use, how do


981
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:53,876
we design with integrity.


982
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,536
Well, as designers and


983
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,316
developers, we take


984
00:32:58,316 --> 00:32:59,096
responsibility.


985
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,326
When architects build spaces


986
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:05,246
today, they make sure they're


987
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:07,356
accessible for everyone because


988
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:08,476
it's a human right.


989
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:10,586
And when designer draw beautiful


990
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,826
cars, they still have to adhere


991
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:15,506
to regulations created for human


992
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:16,316
safety.


993
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:18,566
So, when we design digital


994
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:20,716
products, we have to hold


995
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:21,966
ourselves accountable for their


996
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,146
accessibility too.


997
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,646
Because when we don't we're


998
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:25,676
deciding who's important.


999
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:30,326
Last year for iOS 10, we


1000
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:31,926
redesigned Maps from the ground


1001
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,436
up.


1002
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:36,196
Making it clearer, simpler, easy


1003
00:33:36,196 --> 00:33:36,816
to use, and faster.


1004
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,466
And it was a big undertaking.


1005
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:41,456
We opened the door on


1006
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,216
accessibility, but we didn't go


1007
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:44,266
that far along the corridor.


1008
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:45,866
It was a busy year.


1009
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,226
But in iOS 11 we did take


1010
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:51,276
responsibility, and we made it a


1011
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:54,226
priority, leveraging the new


1012
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:55,916
UIKit frameworks and following


1013
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,326
the principles that Caroline


1014
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,546
outlined today.


1015
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,316
Making as much text dynamic as


1016
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:03,776
possible, displaying the same


1017
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,366
amount of text as the default


1018
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:09,226
UI, using as much of the screen


1019
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:11,696
width for text.


1020
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:12,746
Search is a core component of


1021
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,795
Maps and now it's easier for


1022
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:15,476
everyone to use.


1023
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:18,485
But it's not always just as


1024
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,096
simple as increasing the font


1025
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:20,315
size.


1026
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:22,216
And you might be thinking, hang


1027
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:24,166
on, I can see some truncation in


1028
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:24,876
these screenshots.


1029
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:26,846
This breaks the principles we're


1030
00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:28,466
talking about, and you're right.


1031
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,456
But sometimes we have to make


1032
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,126
choices based on context.


1033
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,525
Like, on the right screen here


1034
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,036
the top of the card has a fixed


1035
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:36,315
header.


1036
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:38,565
So, if we didn't truncate, the


1037
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,295
route options beneath would not


1038
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:40,906
be scrollable.


1039
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:45,906
Now, this is the card for a


1040
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:46,176
place.


1041
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:47,806
They're used in different


1042
00:34:47,806 --> 00:34:50,516
context across iOS, including


1043
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:53,045
Spotlight, Safari, and Siri.


1044
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:55,376
And from here you start


1045
00:34:55,376 --> 00:34:58,106
navigation, make a call to check


1046
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:58,996
on your reservation.


1047
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:00,986
Or even have a look at what's


1048
00:35:00,986 --> 00:35:01,396
inside.


1049
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:03,546
Things everyone might like to


1050
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:03,660
do.


1051
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,196
So, let's take a closer look at


1052
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:08,306
some of the components of this


1053
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:10,576
design, like the title block.


1054
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:15,436
We use this with search results


1055
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:18,106
too and last year we truncated


1056
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:20,226
the title for long place names


1057
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:21,436
instead of wrapping.


1058
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:24,206
But with a big of UIKit magic,


1059
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:28,336
this year, now it does this.


1060
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:29,556
Which is actually pretty cool.


1061
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:32,386
And the component is more


1062
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:34,226
effective and robust because of


1063
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:35,000
it.


1064
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,126
And we made some changes to the


1065
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:38,516
place card this year to improve


1066
00:35:38,516 --> 00:35:40,336
hierarchy including this


1067
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:41,836
secondary row of actions.


1068
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:44,336
And we need to accommodate a


1069
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:45,996
maximum of five options here.


1070
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:47,466
Like these.


1071
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:50,196
So, on an iPhone 7, in English,


1072
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:52,146
hang on a sec.


1073
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:57,116
That was such a cheap joke.


1074
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:00,686
On iPhone 7, in English this


1075
00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:02,336
works and we can fit five in a


1076
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:02,403
row.


1077
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:04,396
But how do we handle it with


1078
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,056
dynamic type?


1079
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,376
Because we can't just increase


1080
00:36:06,436 --> 00:36:07,106
the font size.


1081
00:36:07,246 --> 00:36:10,826
But we could stack the UI


1082
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:12,006
elements smartly.


1083
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:16,726
And all the way up the scale.


1084
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:18,946
Internationalization is a form


1085
00:36:19,116 --> 00:36:20,186
of accessibility too.


1086
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:21,366
And it brings its own


1087
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:21,876
challenges.


1088
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:23,986
So, how about these labels in


1089
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:24,396
Italian.


1090
00:36:25,136 --> 00:36:27,716
OK, they're a bit longer.


1091
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:31,036
So, if we go back down to


1092
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:34,076
default size, oh, but the label


1093
00:36:34,076 --> 00:36:34,776
is truncating.


1094
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:37,106
And the label is important.


1095
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:39,446
We should try not to truncate it


1096
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,026
at any size.


1097
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:42,396
But we could apply a similar


1098
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:45,256
technique like this.


1099
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:48,126
And now, they remain clear and


1100
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:48,796
uncompromised.


1101
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,396
Adaptive design based on a


1102
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:54,466
user's language and UI settings.


1103
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:57,636
And now it works better across


1104
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:58,956
different device sizes too.


1105
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:03,256
And for these actions at the


1106
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:05,166
bottom of the card, as well as


1107
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:08,286
all of the content, we reflowed


1108
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:13,276
the labels and scaled the icons.


1109
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,206
Using vector assets, so there's


1110
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:15,976
no pixilation.


1111
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:18,326
And of course, we made all the


1112
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,576
labels VoiceOver enabled.


1113
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:21,586
And in Maps, we hung out with


1114
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:22,186
Siri as well.


1115
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:26,086
So, there are more complex


1116
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:27,226
challenges than the ones I just


1117
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:27,806
illustrated.


1118
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:30,176
And it's easier not to take


1119
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:30,926
responsibility.


1120
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,766
But challenges are rewarding.


1121
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:37,726
And that's how I ended up;


1122
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,916
challenges are fun and


1123
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:40,556
rewarding.


1124
00:37:40,556 --> 00:37:41,456
And that's why I ended up


1125
00:37:41,456 --> 00:37:42,996
standing here today.


1126
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:44,426
Designing for everyone is a


1127
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:46,336
process that can bring a deeper


1128
00:37:46,336 --> 00:37:49,056
understanding of your product


1129
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:52,986
and its purpose.


1130
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,796
One of the few effective keys to


1131
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:55,716
the design problem.


1132
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,616
The ability of the designer to


1133
00:37:58,616 --> 00:37:59,886
recognize as many of the


1134
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:02,416
constraints possible, their


1135
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,096
willingness and enthusiasm for


1136
00:38:04,336 --> 00:38:05,156
working within these


1137
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:05,736
constraints.


1138
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:09,496
Because out of constraints come


1139
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,336
great solutions.


1140
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:11,976
And if we're designing just for


1141
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:14,156
default settings, we're not


1142
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:14,906
doing it right.


1143
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:17,266
By trying to do better than


1144
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:19,226
that, we make ourselves better.


1145
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,696
And we really learned an awful


1146
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,000
lot this year.


1147
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:26,686
So, secondly after we decide to


1148
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:29,426
take responsibility, we need to


1149
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:30,356
think about empathy.


1150
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:32,796
The ability to understand


1151
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:33,066
people.


1152
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:35,746
To recognize their wants,


1153
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:37,566
desires, and feelings.


1154
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,456
People that are not you --


1155
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,266
because nobody else is.


1156
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:45,956
So, let's take a look at a few


1157
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,396
made-up examples that might be


1158
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:51,396
closer to home.


1159
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:52,196
Newspapers.


1160
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:54,616
Never been accessible.


1161
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:57,306
There's something nice to


1162
00:38:57,306 --> 00:38:58,456
sitting down with a newspaper,


1163
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:01,606
but not if you can't read it.


1164
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:04,686
If your vision isn't perfect,


1165
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:06,296
reading one of these has always


1166
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:06,916
been a challenge.


1167
00:39:08,076 --> 00:39:09,116
And a lot of you create


1168
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,386
platforms for content that's


1169
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:12,746
consumed the world over.


1170
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:15,816
Platforms with the capabilities


1171
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:18,296
to improve the readability of


1172
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:20,626
our content, relatively and


1173
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,256
automatically.


1174
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:24,016
And platforms, which can be


1175
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:25,946
navigated and understood through


1176
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,836
sound for those who can't read


1177
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:28,236
visually.


1178
00:39:28,856 --> 00:39:32,576
And we read a lot on our iPhones


1179
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:33,276
or iPads.


1180
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,026
Sometimes it's good news, other


1181
00:39:36,026 --> 00:39:36,976
times it's bad news.


1182
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,126
Or, depending on where you look,


1183
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:42,946
it could be fake news, like


1184
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:44,276
these revelations about Lorem


1185
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:44,736
ipsum.


1186
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,286
So, here's the same article with


1187
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:51,776
some visual considerations for


1188
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:52,756
dynamic type.


1189
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,546
The headline is moved outside


1190
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:57,176
the hero image for better


1191
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:58,956
contrast and for practicality.


1192
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,736
And the content is readable at


1193
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:02,706
my preferred size.


1194
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,226
And it still looks great.


1195
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,526
But what if you couldn't read a


1196
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:08,026
price tag?


1197
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:10,296
What would the experience of


1198
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:11,216
buying things be like?


1199
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,676
You can't tap on a price tag to


1200
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,646
hear an audio cue, but on an


1201
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:19,866
iPhone, iPad, or Mac you can do


1202
00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:22,556
exactly that and more.


1203
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,486
So, here we are shopping for


1204
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:27,076
fresh, delicious, emoji-fied


1205
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:27,686
fruit.


1206
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:30,736
And there's a two-column layout


1207
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:31,626
at default settings.


1208
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:33,476
So, if we turn up dynamic types


1209
00:40:33,476 --> 00:40:36,096
a bit, we could reflow the


1210
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,536
content into one linear list.


1211
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,376
Similar to how you would on a


1212
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:41,976
responsive website between


1213
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,576
desktop and mobile breakpoints.


1214
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:45,856
Giving enough space to elements


1215
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:47,876
to make them simpler and easier


1216
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:49,906
to pass.


1217
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,256
And here's our product page for


1218
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:51,886
this pineapple.


1219
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:54,926
Adapting your layout


1220
00:40:54,926 --> 00:40:56,736
appropriately makes sure the


1221
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:57,986
most important actions are


1222
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:58,926
available immediately.


1223
00:40:59,906 --> 00:41:00,976
So, again if we bump up the


1224
00:41:00,976 --> 00:41:04,146
dynamic type that's working


1225
00:41:04,146 --> 00:41:04,536
pretty well.


1226
00:41:05,376 --> 00:41:06,846
But, let's turn it up to the


1227
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:07,406
maximum.


1228
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:11,336
Nice, but is there more we can


1229
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:11,676
do here?


1230
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,996
If we scroll the card, we can


1231
00:41:14,996 --> 00:41:17,326
see the most desired actions are


1232
00:41:17,326 --> 00:41:18,196
a little bit far way.


1233
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:20,916
So, maybe we'd consider swapping


1234
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:21,936
them in this context.


1235
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:25,206
Yes. And that's definitely


1236
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:26,016
better.


1237
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:28,166
Well, what about music,


1238
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:31,476
podcasts, stories, sound?


1239
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,256
Audio content is great because


1240
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:35,596
it plays over the air, or your


1241
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:36,046
headphones.


1242
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:37,776
You don't need a UI to be


1243
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:38,636
entertained by it.


1244
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,736
But you do need a UI to be able


1245
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:42,186
to discover it.


1246
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,076
And in the new podcast and music


1247
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:47,086
apps on iOS 11, the content


1248
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:48,686
adapts to your preferences and


1249
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:50,246
can be used with VoiceOver, so


1250
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:51,766
everyone can access it.


1251
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:56,096
Now, finally potential energy.


1252
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:57,586
Unlocking potential.


1253
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:00,856
If we make more things possible


1254
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:03,306
for more types of people, more


1255
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:03,936
things can happen.


1256
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:07,116
Awesome things like iconic


1257
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,016
albums or pioneering science.


1258
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,376
Or miraculous things like


1259
00:42:11,566 --> 00:42:13,646
remembering your friends'


1260
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:14,946
birthdays.


1261
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:16,526
Simple things like sending a


1262
00:42:16,526 --> 00:42:18,246
gift or a message to a loved


1263
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:18,976
one.


1264
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:21,886
Can anyone read that?


1265
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:26,616
We're reliant on language and


1266
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:29,306
our remarkable use of it is


1267
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,696
perhaps the primary reason for


1268
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:32,056
our success as a species.


1269
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:34,576
Be it through colors, text,


1270
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:36,566
sound, or signs.


1271
00:42:37,296 --> 00:42:40,276
And what about now?


1272
00:42:41,286 --> 00:42:42,586
German speakers in the room are


1273
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:43,796
one step ahead of us.


1274
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:45,886
If we don't communicate in


1275
00:42:45,886 --> 00:42:48,176
everyone's language, how can we


1276
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:49,986
help them accomplish things?


1277
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:53,336
Without understanding, we can't


1278
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,436
create any value at all.


1279
00:42:54,506 --> 00:42:58,686
I read an amazing article


1280
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,776
earlier this week called, "The


1281
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:02,896
Thoughts of a Spider Web" by


1282
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:03,756
Joshua Sokol.


1283
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:06,366
And in it there was an example


1284
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:09,486
about how bees use ultraviolet


1285
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,806
vision to find flowers that have


1286
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,406
also evolved ultraviolet


1287
00:43:13,406 --> 00:43:13,836
markings.


1288
00:43:15,186 --> 00:43:16,426
And beside it a quote which


1289
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:19,106
said, "if you don't have those


1290
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:21,736
receptors that part of the world


1291
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:23,526
simply doesn't exist."


1292
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,626
Design that includes everyone is


1293
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:30,206
not good design, it's great


1294
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:31,096
design.


1295
00:43:32,116 --> 00:43:33,616
So, design with integrity.


1296
00:43:34,216 --> 00:43:36,056
Take responsibility, caring


1297
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:38,156
about everyone's experience, not


1298
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:38,696
just your own.


1299
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:41,826
And be empathetic considering


1300
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:43,676
the perspectives of others who


1301
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:44,906
interact with the world in


1302
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:46,676
different ways than you do.


1303
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:49,436
And understand that by doing so


1304
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:51,856
we can help unlock potential, in


1305
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:53,276
tiny and huge ways.


1306
00:43:56,516 --> 00:44:01,846
[ Applause ]


1307
00:44:02,346 --> 00:44:04,556
>> So, together we can strive


1308
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,486
for simplicity and


1309
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:08,116
perceivability in our apps.


1310
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:10,126
And do it all with integrity for


1311
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:11,676
making good apps great.


1312
00:44:13,076 --> 00:44:14,896
I encourage you to start now.


1313
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:17,026
Go home and audit your apps.


1314
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:18,676
Start conversations with your


1315
00:44:18,676 --> 00:44:20,446
team and people who use your


1316
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:20,906
apps.


1317
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:22,986
And most importantly schedule


1318
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:24,676
time to see it all the way into


1319
00:44:24,676 --> 00:44:25,596
customers' hands.


1320
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,676
And lastly do it proudly.


1321
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:31,346
We can give everyone the chance


1322
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:33,406
to be surprised, delighted, feel


1323
00:44:33,406 --> 00:44:34,466
good, and empowered.


1324
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:37,396
We especially as designers would


1325
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:39,176
always like things to line up


1326
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,916
just right, but you can't


1327
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:42,206
control every line break.


1328
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:44,566
You can't control how someone


1329
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:45,796
will need to personalize their


1330
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:47,706
experience because everyone is


1331
00:44:47,706 --> 00:44:48,136
different.


1332
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:50,186
And let's celebrate that.


1333
00:44:52,516 --> 00:44:53,716
>> We're really proud of what


1334
00:44:53,716 --> 00:44:54,736
we've achieved in Maps this


1335
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:57,056
year, but there's more to do and


1336
00:44:57,056 --> 00:44:57,806
we're going to keep going,


1337
00:44:58,026 --> 00:44:59,886
because a map is never finished.


1338
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,086
And everyone wants to find their


1339
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:02,296
