1
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:11,796
>> Good morning.


2
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,736
Welcome to session 702
Managing Apple Devices.


3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,236
[ Applause ]


4
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,446
Wow. I wasn't expecting
that enthusiastic


5
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:21,846
of welcome this early
in the morning.


6
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:24,636
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I
am very happy to be here


7
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:26,806
with you even at this
ridiculously early hour


8
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:27,966
for techies like me.


9
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:31,296
Although for some of you, this
may be the middle of your day


10
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:33,066
if you work in schools
our otherwise have


11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:33,976
to wear a tie to work.


12
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:37,726
Many of us are far more likely
to see this hour at the end


13
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:40,276
of a long night of coding than
at the beginning of our day.


14
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:43,766
Now, I open by recognizing
our differences


15
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,886
because this session's
content is intended


16
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:47,116
for a diverse audience.


17
00:00:47,116 --> 00:00:50,946
From Indian vendors, who need to
learn how to take full advantage


18
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:52,926
of the powerful device
management capabilities


19
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:58,206
that we've built into iOS 8 and
OS X Yosemite, to app developers


20
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:01,196
who want to understand how their
apps may be used in schools


21
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:04,036
and businesses, to
administrators who need


22
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:06,946
to know what changes are coming
in the OS releases this year.


23
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,666
When I stood before you here
last year, I was thrilled


24
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:15,176
to announce 2 huge leaps forward
in managing Apple devices.


25
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:17,966
In the addition of
managed distribution


26
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:21,016
to our Volume Purchase
Program and the introduction


27
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,656
of the Device Enrollment
Program which Craig highlighted


28
00:01:23,656 --> 00:01:25,846
in the enterprise section
of yesterday's Keynote.


29
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:28,226
It's hard to believe there
was an enterprise section


30
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:29,976
at the Keynote, but it
was very exciting to see.


31
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:36,626
[ Applause ]


32
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:40,116
When we set out to create
the device in Roman program,


33
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:43,436
we did so after wondering, why
does it have to be painful to do


34
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,716
that initial configuration


35
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:47,316
of your devices before handing
them out to their users?


36
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:50,076
And we started by
asking a simple question.


37
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:54,246
Why can't it be as easy as
just un-boxing that device


38
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:57,626
and handing that iPad or that
iPhone or that Mac to its user?


39
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:01,476
And it turns out many of you
are asking the same question.


40
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:05,116
And I'm very pleased to report
that our customers are just


41
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:06,856
as thrilled by the
transformative nature


42
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,455
of this new service
as we had hoped.


43
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:12,666
One noteworthy example is
Immaculata La Salle High School


44
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,496
in Florida who believe
that we, indeed,


45
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,056
turned this dream
into a reality.


46
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:22,296
And they proved it by completely
replacing their fleet of iPads


47
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:26,826
with 600 new iPad Airs including
restoring all the student apps


48
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,756
and data from iCloud
in 2.5 hours.


49
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:33,016
They made a wonderful video
showing just how they did it.


50
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:35,426
And if you've never seen the
Device Enrollment Program


51
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:37,636
in action, I highly
recommend checking it out.


52
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:42,996
So since we last met, we've
been very busy launching managed


53
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,336
distribution last fall.


54
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,356
The Device Enrollment
Program a few months ago.


55
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:53,806
And we've also been busy adding
all these features to fill


56
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,576
in the gaps and smooth
out the inconsistencies


57
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,296
between iOS and OS X.


58
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:00,256
So that vendors, like some


59
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:02,516
of you creating device
management tools,


60
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,676
and the administrators,
using those tools,


61
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,896
have a much easier time managing
all their Apple devices.


62
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,546
This session is going to cover
the entire life cycle device


63
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:15,966
management including both
new tools existing tools


64
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,386
and technologies and
all the changes coming


65
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:20,716
in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.


66
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:22,946
And we'll show you how
they all come together


67
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:24,416
to provide a great experience


68
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,936
for both the administrators
and their end users.


69
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:31,056
From enrolling devices in your
management solution of choice


70
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:36,226
to distributing content to
all those devices to the day


71
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:38,136
to day ongoing management
tasks that come


72
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,546
up as time goes on
and needs change.


73
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:45,056
So let's dive right in and
talk about enrolling devices.


74
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:47,736
Of course, we're going to
spend a fair amount of time


75
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:48,946
on the device enrollment
program,


76
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:50,126
the best way to do this.


77
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,486
I'll also talk about
Apple Configurator


78
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,606
as an alternative way
to enroll your devices.


79
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,826
You also need to be aware of
how to manage Activation Lock


80
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:01,596
on supervised devices
and be thinking


81
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,086
about that at enrollment time.


82
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:06,376
And then I'll conclude
with what's coming


83
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,056
in this year's OS releases.


84
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,826
So before we go any
further, I want to make sure


85
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:13,576
that everyone understands what
the Device Enrollment Program is


86
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:14,226
and is not.


87
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:16,956
So it relates, you know,
audience participation.


88
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,106
Let's get going, although I
appreciate all the responses


89
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:22,756
already, the Device Enrollment
Program is not a MDM server.


90
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:23,816
Come on, say it with me,


91
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:27,146
Device Enrollment Program
is not an MDM server.


92
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:27,806
Thank you.


93
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:31,316
Though you'll note they're both
3 letter acronyms, those of you


94
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:33,726
with eagle eyes with note
they're not the same 3 letters.


95
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:38,496
In fact, the Device Enrollment
Program is the best way


96
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:39,966
to get your devices enrolled


97
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:41,966
in whatever MDM solution
you're going to use.


98
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,926
It's an easy button to get your
devices in your MDM server.


99
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:50,276
It's really 2 parts: A way
for administrators to specify


100
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:52,736
which settings they want to use
when their devices are enrolled


101
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:53,916
in their management solution.


102
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:58,036
And the integration
of the completion


103
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,436
of that enrollment process
right into the normal set


104
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,656
of assistant process
that the user will go


105
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:05,666
through on both iOS and OS X.


106
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,746
As I mentioned, we
launched this in February


107
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:12,656
with devices eligible that
are purchased via direct sales


108
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:15,826
in the U.S. And we've heard all
of your feedback loud and clear


109
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,326
that you'd like to
see us expanded


110
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,716
to additional countries
and channels.


111
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:21,266
So I'm very pleased that,


112
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:23,546
although we've only launched
this a few months ago,


113
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,946
we've already expanded access
to our neighbors to the North.


114
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:28,946
Any Canadians here?


115
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,826
I'm so sorry about the
Canadians, but, in fact,


116
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:34,806
the Rangers knocked my Flyers
out in the first round;


117
00:05:34,806 --> 00:05:36,476
so get them next year.


118
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,666
We've also made a number
of other changes already


119
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,656
since launch that I
wanted to point out.


120
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:47,006
Devices are now eligible
up to 3 years in the past


121
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,566
if you've purchased
them up to 3 years ago.


122
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:51,556
And there's some enhancements
to the portal that allow you


123
00:05:51,556 --> 00:05:54,736
to set a default MDM server so
that any new device purchases


124
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:57,066
with automatically be
assigned to that MDM server


125
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:58,666
without you needing to
take further action.


126
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,876
You can also now see which
administrators assigned


127
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:04,216
which devices to
which MDM servers.


128
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,756
And another, coming soon,
expansion of eligibility is


129
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:09,906
that when devices that are


130
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:13,066
in the Device Enrollment
Program are replaced by service,


131
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,796
those devices will
soon be remain


132
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:18,876
in the Device Enrollment Program
including, retroactively,


133
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,326
devices that have been
replaced over the past 3 years.


134
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,826
We think customers will
really appreciate that too.


135
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:30,146
So let's quickly recap exactly
how this service works before I


136
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:32,496
go into details, especially
for the MDM vendors.


137
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:36,946
Customer purchases devices,
that information is fed


138
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:38,246
into the Device Enrollment
Program.


139
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:43,236
When the customer provides
their account information


140
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,276
to their MDM solution, the MDM
solution can download the device


141
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,586
information from the program.


142
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,426
The administrator can then
specify their settings


143
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,826
and upload those to the program.


144
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,896
Then, when users open
the box and start walking


145
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:59,096
through the setup assistant,
the device receives its settings


146
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:01,766
from the Device Enrollment
Program which tell it


147
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:03,656
to enroll with the MDM server.


148
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,966
And I also, again, want
to emphasize that once


149
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,986
that happens, Device Enrollment
Program has done its job.


150
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:09,976
It's out of the picture,


151
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:12,736
and your MDM solution is the
only thing that's talking


152
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:13,376
to the devices.


153
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:19,356
So we're going to talk about
3 topics a few moments here


154
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,566
related to the Device
Enrollment Program and how best


155
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,586
to integrate this into
your MDM solutions.


156
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:30,706
So the first concept is, where
should the ultimate repository


157
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:33,336
of the truth relating to
the program, the devices


158
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,836
and the settings reside?


159
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:38,546
The device information
should really be


160
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:40,806
in the Device Enrollment Program
and treat that as the truth.


161
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,276
You can always fetch
that information


162
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:43,936
from the service
to your MDM server.


163
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:47,396
But the settings that the
administrator decides to apply


164
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,786
to certain groups of devices,


165
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:52,986
your server should really treat
itself as the truth for that.


166
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:55,166
It can always upload new
settings to the program.


167
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:01,056
One caveat here to keep in mind,
though, is what I explained


168
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:03,046
on the previous slide: Even


169
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,296
if the administrator
changes the settings that are


170
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,546
in the Device Enrollment
Program for a particular device


171
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:10,536
or devices, those devices
will not see those settings


172
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:13,486
until the next time that they go
through activation after wiping


173
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,016
and going back through
the setup assistant.


174
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,336
So if the device is already
enrolled and you happen


175
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:18,956
to change the setting to
say, Well, now I want it


176
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,016
to be supervised,
that won't take effect


177
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:24,886
until the next time
the device is set up.


178
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:25,606
All right.


179
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:28,676
So disowning devices, you may be
thinking, what does that mean?


180
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:30,506
Well, this removing a device


181
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:31,836
from the Device Enrollment
Program.


182
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:33,236
And I'm here to scare you.


183
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:38,765
Our recommendation is to
not implement this feature.


184
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:40,316
Why is that?


185
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,446
Well, and if you're
going to break Rule No.


186
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,756
1, you need to really,


187
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,356
really how many "reallys"
did I put on there?


188
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,976
really make sure they
understand the consequences:


189
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:51,396
That they will not be able
to undo this action and get


190
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:52,976
that device back
into the program.


191
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,786
So, again, we recommend
following Rule 1.


192
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:58,116
All right.


193
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:01,696
Our final topic is thinking
about the combinations of two


194
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,776
of the specific enrollment
settings that you can configure


195
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:06,916
for a device: Whether
it's supervised or not,


196
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,026
and whether that MDM
enrollment can be removed or not


197
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,456
by the user on the device.


198
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:15,776
And there our own Profile
Manager has taken the approach


199
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:17,566
of not separating
these settings.


200
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:21,196
That if you choose to supervise
a device, it automatically,


201
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:24,556
the MDM enrollment is not
removable, that top right box.


202
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:27,636
The bottom right
box is forbidden.


203
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:30,016
If you try to upload settings


204
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:33,026
where the device
is not supervised


205
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,256
and the MDM enrollment is
not removable by the user,


206
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,336
the service will
reject those settings.


207
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:40,596
The lower left box
may be interesting,


208
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:43,206
again Profile Manager
doesn't well,


209
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,806
that's what profile manger does


210
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:46,396
if you don't check
the supervised box


211
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:47,786
that it's completely open.


212
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:51,606
It's not supervised; end user
can undo the MDM enrollment.


213
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:53,676
Those 2 are really
the interesting ones.


214
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,146
The kind of half one in
the upper left is allowed,


215
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,456
but probably not
super interesting


216
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:00,386
to supervise a device
but still allow the user


217
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,066
to un enroll from MDM.


218
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,796
So that's a couple notes about
the Device Enrollment Program.


219
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:09,656
Let's talk a bit about
Apple Configurator.


220
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:13,936
So again Apple Configurator
is also not an MDM server.


221
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,596
I want to make sure
everyone's clear about that.


222
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:20,106
But it is an alternative way
to install enrollment settings


223
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:22,356
on a particular iOS
device over USB.


224
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,206
As an alternative to using
Device Enrollment Program


225
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:25,776
over the Air.


226
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,276
Once those settings have
been loaded to the device,


227
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:32,186
the actual requests that
go to the MDM server


228
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,716
to complete the enrollment
are indistinguishable


229
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:37,406
from whether they were
done the settings got there


230
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,866
over the Air or over USB.


231
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,456
However, you can teach
your server to distinguish


232
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:44,586
between the 2 if
you check to see


233
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:48,486
if that particular device
that's enrolling is in the list


234
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:50,316
that you've gotten from the
Device Enrollment Program.


235
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,656
Also, if a device has
already gotten its settings


236
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,056
from the Device Enrollment
Program,


237
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,376
Configurator will not
overwrite those settings.


238
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,716
One additional caveat is


239
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:04,156
that delivering your enrollment
settings via the Device


240
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,036
Enrollment Program
is the only way


241
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:08,216
that you can make your MDM
enrollment not removable


242
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:08,896
by the user.


243
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:13,676
Another recommendation and
one that we followed ourselves


244
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:16,216
in Profile Manager is that
it's probably a good idea


245
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,916
to offer administrators
the option


246
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:22,606
to disallow installing settings
over USB if you want to ensure


247
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:25,636
that they only get your
institution's devices only get


248
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,946
the settings that
you specify via DEP.


249
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:32,046
That would present a user
from using Configurator


250
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:36,436
to install settings that allow
enrollment in your MDM server


251
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:37,876
without supervising for example.


252
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,706
Let's now talk a little bit


253
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,186
about Activation
Lock Management.


254
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:47,496
So by default a supervised
device does not allow the user


255
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,786
to enroll in or to
enable Activation Lock.


256
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:57,656
But there is now a way that
we introduced in the spring


257
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:03,446
that MDM can request a bypass
code that allows the MDM server


258
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:06,226
to later or the administrator
to later clear Activation Lock


259
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,016
without needing the
user's password.


260
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:12,066
At that time, there's
also a MDM command


261
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,926
that can tell the device, well,
okay, now you can allow the user


262
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:16,076
to enable Activation Lock.


263
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:18,716
So you want to do all of
this at enrollment time.


264
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,446
If, in fact, your institution
wants to use Activation Lock,


265
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:22,946
which is a great feature.


266
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:27,006
We also recommend
that once you retrieve


267
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:30,856
that Activation Lock bypass
code that you provide access


268
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:33,866
to the administrator to in the
UI because it may be useful


269
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,586
to maybe enter it
manually on a device


270
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:38,076
that for whatever reason
is not currently reachable


271
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,226
by the MDM server.


272
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:44,416
There are 3 new MDM commands
to retrieve the code,


273
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:46,356
to then delete it
from the device


274
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,766
so that no one can
grab it off the device


275
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:51,866
if they get physical access
to it, and then, of course,


276
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,936
to enable or allow the device
to enable Activation Lock.


277
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:56,656
And we strongly recommend


278
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,996
that when you're completing
the MDM enrollment, that,


279
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,816
at that time, you
always retrieve


280
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:03,196
and then clear the bypass
code from the device


281
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,446
because it's only
available for 15 days


282
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,916
after the device was supervised.


283
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:10,756
You should also save
that bypass code even


284
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,336
if a particular device
is un-enrolled from MDM


285
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,796
because Activation Lock
may still be enabled.


286
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,166
And you may still
need to clear it.


287
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,646
And the device can
later re enroll.


288
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:22,396
And there won't be another
opportunity to get a bypass code


289
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:25,376
until the device is
wiped and re supervised.


290
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:30,596
So those are the topics I
wanted to cover on enrolling.


291
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:34,156
But I'm also happy to tell you
that there's important change


292
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,966
in how the device responds


293
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:39,206
when the enrollment is being
completed in Setup Assistant.


294
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:42,636
And I know your servers
are all real excited.


295
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:45,186
The administrators have no
doubt specified lots of settings


296
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:46,536
and apps and all
sorts of things.


297
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,506
They want to deliver to the
device as soon as it's enrolled;


298
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:51,136
however, the device
isn't ready to respond


299
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:53,526
to all those requests while
the user is still completing


300
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:54,286
Setup Assistant.


301
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:57,336
So now when any of these
MDM commands are sent


302
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,006
to the device while it is
still in the Setup Assistant,


303
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,086
it will return the
"not now" status.


304
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,386
So your server can know,
hey, device isn't ready.


305
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:07,656
I'm going to wait until
it returns success


306
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:08,326
for that enrollment.


307
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:12,366
And then you can start
completing your enrollment tasks


308
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:14,856
or configuration tasks.


309
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:17,386
So without further ado, I'd
like to show you how this works,


310
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:20,336
and I'm going to invite my
colleagues Jussi Pekka and Mark


311
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:22,946
up to show you a demo
of enrolling devices.


312
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:26,726
[ Applause ]


313
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:27,716
>> All right, thank you, Todd.


314
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:31,396
So here we have an out of box,
freshly delivered, new iPad.


315
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:35,806
Basically it was purchased by
the institution and it didn't go


316
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:36,706
through some boiler room.


317
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:38,276
It was just handed
straight to the user


318
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:41,526
and our Profile Manager
server this is our MDM server


319
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:45,116
for this demo knows about
this device because the time


320
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,646
between Device Enrollment
Program and Profile Manager


321
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,416
and the device the purchase
was made through the channels.


322
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,906
So we know that this device is
configured for our services.


323
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,916
So I'm going to walk
through the setup as usual.


324
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,956
I'm going to pick my language.


325
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,586
Go pick my country.


326
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:00,876
Connect to my network.


327
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:03,566
So at this point, the
device is now talking


328
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,576
to the Apple Services


329
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:07,336
and obtaining its
activation information.


330
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:10,866
And as part of that information
is the notice that we are now


331
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:16,146
in the DEP and we got prompted
for enrolling in the MDM server.


332
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:20,646
So just in a second we are still
returning some information.


333
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:24,206
And now we are talking
to our server.


334
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,196
So this is as far as DEP
has talked to the device.


335
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,556
Now we're talking
to our MDM server.


336
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,496
And I can find more
information about our instance.


337
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,776
So if I need to know
what to do next,


338
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:36,196
I can call the ACME Help Desk.


339
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:38,656
And now I go to the next.


340
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:42,646
And you see that when I go
forward, I'm now prompted


341
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:44,556
for my user name and password.


342
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:47,906
And I cannot bypass this;
so I do have to enroll this.


343
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,646
So this device has been
configured to be supervised,


344
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:53,956
and the MDM profile
is mandatory.


345
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,236
So I have no way of
bypassing this step.


346
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:59,856
So I'll provide my log in
information and move on.


347
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:04,726
And now we're downloading the
profiles from our MDM server.


348
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:09,576
So, again the DEP phase has been
completed, and now we're talking


349
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,206
to our management server.


350
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,626
And Mark has set some
screens to be bypassed here,


351
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:16,836
so we're not seeing
registration and other pieces.


352
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,956
And while I complete my setup
logging into my iCloud account,


353
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,486
I'll have Mark show you
the setup in the backside.


354
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:25,576
>> Yep. So Jussi is going to
finish setting up his iPad.


355
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:27,396
And I want to walk
you through how


356
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:29,556
in Profile Manager we've
implemented this UI


357
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,676
to support configuring
Device Enrollment Program.


358
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,706
So on the left side
you see the devices


359
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:35,646
that my server has retrieved


360
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,516
from the Device Enrollment
Program.


361
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:40,396
My server is configured
to download these devices,


362
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:42,856
and then I have Jussi's
iPad selected here.


363
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:44,536
And you can see the
enrollment settings


364
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,846
that I've got selected here.


365
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:49,566
Our first option is whether
to turn on this configuration


366
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,436
for this device or not.


367
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:52,356
You can also put
these configurations


368
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:53,776
on device groups as well.


369
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:54,756
So you can get a
whole collection


370
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:56,896
of devices get the
same settings.


371
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:58,556
So we have this checked
on because we wanted


372
00:16:58,556 --> 00:16:59,456
to send the settings down.


373
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:00,826
The next option is whether


374
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:03,066
or not the user is
allowed to skip enrollment.


375
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:06,715
And, as you saw in the case of
Jussi's device, he's not allowed


376
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:09,205
to skip enrollment; he's going
to be prompted for credentials,


377
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:10,486
credentials for his
directory server.


378
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,816
Our next option is whether
or not we want to do


379
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,675
over the air supervision
of the device.


380
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:17,856
Now, in addition to being
able to supervise the device,


381
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,236
when you supervise the device,
you also have the option


382
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:22,205
of locking the MDM Profile


383
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:23,756
so it can't be removed
from the device.


384
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:26,486
In our case, we've combined
those into one option


385
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:28,566
because we think our customers,
whenever they supervise,


386
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,446
they're going to want
to have locked MDM.


387
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:33,696
But if you're a third party MDM
developer, you can always break


388
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:36,446
that out and have it
as a separate option.


389
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:41,276
The next thing is whether or
not you want to allow pairing.


390
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:44,296
So I have that turned on
so the device can pair


391
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,226
with another Mac if you want.


392
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,016
Next is to request
credentials for enrollment.


393
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:50,436
You saw Jussi's device was
prompted for credentials.


394
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:51,786
And then there are
various things


395
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:53,646
that we can skip
during the setup show


396
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,486
or skip during the
Setup Assistant.


397
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:58,276
In our case, we have Apple
ID enabled because we want


398
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:00,426
to caption on, Jussi's
device will get Activation


399
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:01,036
Lock enabled.


400
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:05,356
So Jussi is finished actually
setting up his device.


401
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:10,666
So I am going to show
you, our security settings


402
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:12,776
for the device right now show


403
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:14,356
that Activation Lock
is not enabled.


404
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:16,156
But I do have the
Activation Lock bypass code.


405
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,086
This what Profile
Manager grabbed


406
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:19,456
from the device when
it was enrolled.


407
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:25,676
If I update my info
now that he's done,


408
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:27,606
we'll see in a moment here


409
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:29,486
that Activation Lock is
going to change to yes.


410
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,056
And find my iPhone is
enabled, is set to yes.


411
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:37,586
So when this device comes
back to me, I'll be able


412
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:39,036
to run this clear
Activation Lock


413
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,916
if Activation Lock
is still enabled.


414
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:43,246
And I and clear that
and hand this device


415
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,106
out to the next user.


416
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:45,456
So back to Todd.


417
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:46,746
>> All right.


418
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:47,416
Thank you, guys.


419
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:52,556
[ Applause ]


420
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:55,816
So Jussi and Mark just
showed you how you can enroll


421
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:58,186
and supervise an iOS device
using the Device Enrollment


422
00:18:58,186 --> 00:19:01,286
Program and how to configure
the enrollment settings


423
00:19:01,286 --> 00:19:03,096
that were used using
Profile Manager.


424
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:05,666
But, of course, that can be
done with any MDM solution


425
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,176
that supports the Device
Enrollment Program.


426
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:09,216
And we hope all of them do.


427
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:11,986
Mark showed you how Profile
Manager had retrieved the


428
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,446
Activation Lock bypass code


429
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,366
as it completed enrollment
of that device.


430
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:20,966
And then Profile Manager
actually automatically allows


431
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:23,496
or there's a setting, enrollment
setting which I don't know


432
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,856
that Mark showed that the
administrator can choose


433
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:29,486
to always automatically allow
Activation Lock once it's


434
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:31,866
retrieved, successfully
retrieved the bypass code.


435
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:35,316
So let's move on to the next
section of our talk and talk


436
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:37,226
about distributing
content to our devices.


437
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:39,226
We're, of course, going to talk


438
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:40,506
about the Volume
Purchase Program


439
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:41,556
and managed distribution.


440
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:45,366
We'll talk a little bit about
managed apps and then conclude


441
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,526
with the significant
enhancements in iOS 8


442
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:51,026
and OS X Yosemite to
fill in some gaps here.


443
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:56,126
So, again, to recap, managed
distribution allows the


444
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:59,166
administrator to buy
licenses instead of codes,


445
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:03,206
which can be revoked and
reallocated to a different user


446
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:06,406
for both apps and books.


447
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:10,956
And we provided API so that
MDM solutions can integrate the


448
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:12,986
service into their solutions.


449
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,666
And it's currently
available in 10 countries.


450
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,696
So, again a refresher of
exactly how this works:


451
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:23,976
The administrator can
purchase apps and books


452
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:26,376
in the VPP Portal, that
information is stored


453
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,216
in the iBookstore
and the App Store.


454
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:31,336
When they provide their
account information


455
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:34,366
to their management solution,
it can download information


456
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,476
about which apps and
books have been purchased


457
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:38,216
and are available
for assignment.


458
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:41,826
It can send assignments
up to the iTunes Store


459
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:45,656
and credit a particular app
or book to a user account.


460
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,806
When the user configures
their Apple ID


461
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:52,666
on a particular Apple device,
they'll see those assignments


462
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,766
in their purchase list and
can download the bits directly


463
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,176
from the store just as if they
had purchased them themselves.


464
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:02,196
And, also, the administrator
can send MDM commands


465
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,746
from the server to the devices
to say download this app


466
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,686
to make sure that it
is actually installed


467
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:08,766
on that particular device.


468
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,836
So, again, dive into a
number of topics related


469
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,976
to the Volume Purchase Program
to give you some advice on how


470
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:18,926
to best integrate this
program into your solutions.


471
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,686
Starting off again with where
should the different pieces


472
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:24,576
of truth reside?


473
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:28,276
And the VPP service itself
should really be the truth


474
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:30,356
for the status of
user enrollment,


475
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,666
whether a user has
accepted an invitation


476
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,666
and associate the their
Apple ID with the VPP user,


477
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,246
which licenses have
been purchased,


478
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:41,336
as I showed on the previous
slide, as well as tracking


479
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:44,276
in irrevocable book
assignments that have been made.


480
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:47,026
You're MDM server should
actually be the truth


481
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:50,046
for everything else including
revocable app assignments.


482
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,836
And you might be
wondering why shouldn't


483
00:21:51,836 --> 00:21:53,246
that be in the VPP service?


484
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,506
Well if your MDM solution
supports group assignments,


485
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:59,006
you'll need to keep that
information in your MDM server


486
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,286
because there's no way to
store group information


487
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,526
in the VPP service.


488
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,936
So if you're going to be able to
reconstitute that, you're going


489
00:22:04,936 --> 00:22:06,766
to need to have all that
within your database.


490
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:10,396
Let's talk a little bit
about account management.


491
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:14,556
When a particular administrator
provides their credentials,


492
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:18,126
their VPP account to your
solution, and you want


493
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:19,346
to establish that
initial connection


494
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:22,546
with the Volume Purchase
Program you're going to need


495
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:24,306
to check the client
context attribute.


496
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,796
And if it's empty that means


497
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:29,106
that no other server
has claimed this account


498
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:30,156
or is using this account.


499
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,656
And you should go
ahead and claim it


500
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:35,766
by providing the host name of
your server and a unique a GUID


501
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:38,426
so that you'll be able to tell
whether your server is still the


502
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:39,066
one managing.


503
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,506
If the client context
has a value


504
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:45,326
and it doesn't match the GUID
that you have for that server,


505
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,876
some other server is
actually using that account.


506
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,876
And you're going to want
to alert the administrator


507
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,936
that some other server is
managing the licenses tied


508
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:56,786
to this account and ask them
to confirm that they, in fact,


509
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:58,506
want this server to
take over that account.


510
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:01,356
That may, in fact, be the right
thing if they're transitioning


511
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:02,796
from one server to the next.


512
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:06,766
And then further, whenever you
re establish the connection


513
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:09,816
to the service, you need to
check client context again


514
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:12,826
to make sure that your server is
still the one that's connected


515
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:13,526
to this account.


516
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:16,416
If it doesn't match
any longer, you, again,


517
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,706
need to stop making
requests to the service


518
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:20,346
and alert the administrator


519
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:23,436
that this other host name
has now claimed this account


520
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,926
so they can take
appropriate action.


521
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,146
If I've mentioned
invitations already,


522
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:32,466
that's part of bootstrapping
this program is


523
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,336
that the administrator
needs it to invite each user


524
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:39,116
to link their Apple ID to
this particular VPP account


525
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:41,206
so that licenses
can be assigned.


526
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:45,386
We strongly recommend that you
do this invitation via MDM.


527
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:46,986
You can easily send


528
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:48,986
that invitation via an
MDM command directly


529
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:50,006
to an enrolled device.


530
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,526
It's much more secure
and reliable.


531
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,886
Email is a fall back if you
have a user you need to invite


532
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:58,636
that doesn't currently
have an enrolled device.


533
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:02,636
But there's a concern that
you need to be aware of that


534
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:05,616
because the invitation URL,
there's an example on screen,


535
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,356
is for the apple.com domain.


536
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:12,186
Many mail servers will
treat an email coming


537
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:15,986
from your server's domain,
including a URL from apple.com


538
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:18,136
as a phishing attack and
they filter them out.


539
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,526
There are a number
of alternative ways


540
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,506
to avoid this problem.


541
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:26,056
You could create your invitation
email URL that brings the user,


542
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:28,836
first, back to your MDM
server before redirected them


543
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:29,936
to the VPP URL.


544
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:33,456
Or you could integrate the
invitation process right


545
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:35,016
into your user portal
if you have one.


546
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:39,796
Let's spend a few
moments talking, again,


547
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:42,996
about user IDs relating to
Volume Purchase Program.


548
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:44,306
I showed this slide last year.


549
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:49,616
There are really 3 ideas of who
the user is from the perspective


550
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:54,046
of the MDM server, from the
perspective of the VPP service,


551
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:56,296
and the end user's Apple ID,


552
00:24:56,426 --> 00:25:00,416
which your MDM server will never
see directly but will see a hash


553
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,246
of it to protect
the user's privacy.


554
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:05,046
Now, this is would be
very simple if we lived


555
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,066
in the ideal world
where each user had one


556
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:11,376
and only one Apple ID
associated with your VPP account


557
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,276
and would never change
that Apple ID.


558
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:16,576
In this case, there would be
a simple one to one mapping


559
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:19,196
between all 3 of these
representations of the user.


560
00:25:20,056 --> 00:25:22,126
Sadly, as many of
you may be aware,


561
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:23,496
we don't live in an ideal world.


562
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:28,236
In the real world, multiple
VPP users can accept their


563
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,266
individual invitations
with the same Apple ID.


564
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:32,736
And you need to be aware
of the implications


565
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,506
of the sharing of Apple IDs.


566
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:38,786
Specifically if you've
assigned a license to a user


567
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:41,276
that than is connected to
that particular Apple ID.


568
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:43,606
If you revoke that assignment,
it's going to revoke it


569
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:47,156
from every Apple every VPP
user sharing that Apple ID.


570
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:51,696
Also, if you try to
assign an app or a book


571
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:55,966
to a VPP user that's
associated with an Apple ID


572
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:59,276
that already has that
app or book assigned,


573
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:02,546
that second assignment
will fail.


574
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:05,736
Another issue in the real
world is that users can,


575
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:08,606
after accepting an
invitation with one Apple ID,


576
00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:12,016
can disassociate from that Apple
ID and associate and accept


577
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,786
that invitation with
a different Apple ID.


578
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:16,956
This becomes a problem if you've
assigned any irrevocable book


579
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,436
licenses to that Apple,
that retired Apple ID.


580
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:23,296
And you'll have to keep track
and think about whether you want


581
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:25,436
to allocate another
irrevocable book license


582
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:26,726
to the new Apple ID or not.


583
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:33,236
So the MDM server's
representation of the user,


584
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:34,686
the client user ID string,


585
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:37,076
is something that's
under your control.


586
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:38,986
And we strongly recommend
you pick a value


587
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:40,926
that will never change,
for example,


588
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:42,836
the user ID from your
directory services


589
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:45,056
where you're getting your
user and group information.


590
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:46,446
You shouldn't choose something


591
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,256
like an email address
which can change.


592
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:51,276
And it's very simple.


593
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,246
I had to have a slide with
some SQL on, I'm sorry.


594
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:56,566
It's very easy, then, to
look up which VPP account


595
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:59,896
that that particular MDM
user is associated with.


596
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:02,886
Whether it's just registered
and you've sent the invitation


597
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:05,746
or actually associated, whether
the user has accepted it.


598
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:10,576
And, finally, the representation


599
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:14,126
of the user's Apple ID who's
accepted the invitation takes


600
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:16,186
the form of an iTunes
store ID hash.


601
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,216
And you should track
this as soon


602
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:20,136
as a user has accepted
an invitation.


603
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:25,416
New in iOS 8, there's now a
MDM query, not just in iOS 8,


604
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:29,386
it's also in OS X Yosemite, a
query to get that hash value


605
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:35,096
so that you can know whether
the Apple ID that's configured


606
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:36,966
on a particular device changes.


607
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:39,276
You won't know exactly what the
Apple ID is but you'll be able


608
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:40,836
to tell if they've disassociated


609
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:43,326
and re-associated
with a different ID.


610
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:46,726
As I mentioned already on the
previous slide, you're going


611
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:50,866
to want to track those retired
values if the user switches


612
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:53,706
to a different Apple ID,
again, so you can keep track


613
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,456
of any irrevocable
book assignments.


614
00:27:55,896 --> 00:28:01,196
There's another new change
that will allow you MDM vendors


615
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,766
to provide a better user
experience in your tools


616
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:07,696
for users outside the U.S. that
we now report the country code


617
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:10,726
that the account is tied to
when you get your information


618
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:13,476
down from the service so that
you can fetch the proper app


619
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,756
metadata, artwork, description,


620
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:18,546
app name from the
correct iTunes Store.


621
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:24,366
So managed apps is
not a new concept.


622
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:26,276
We've had it for a
couple of iOS releases.


623
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:30,626
It's a way for enterprises
to keep better control


624
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,926
over the data and documents
tied to particular apps.


625
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:36,026
It works with both App
Store and enterprise apps.


626
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:39,916
The managed apps must
be installed via MDM


627
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:42,296
with the install
application command


628
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:45,686
and with the management
flag set on the app itself.


629
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:49,286
One limitation is that if the
user has already installed an


630
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:51,596
app, the MDM server
cannot convert it


631
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,926
to manage retroactively.


632
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:54,766
However, the server
can, of course,


633
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:59,046
detect that an app is unmanaged
and then alert the administrator


634
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:02,766
so they could take action
outside of MDM, if necessary,


635
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,306
to have the user delete that app


636
00:29:05,306 --> 00:29:07,306
and the MDM server
push it out again.


637
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:13,576
Managed apps work with Managed
Open In a new feature in iOS 7


638
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:16,176
to help, again, prevent
data leakage


639
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:19,026
from managed apps
to unmanaged apps.


640
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:21,616
So that if you have
a particular app


641
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:25,156
that has sensitive documents,
you can treat it as managed.


642
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:28,216
Turn on Managed Open In, and
then users will not be able


643
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:30,256
to open those documents
in other apps


644
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:31,666
like well, I won't name any.


645
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:35,166
So you might imagine, I
talked about filling gaps


646
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,646
and eliminating inconsistencies.


647
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:40,786
We have managed apps so what
are we introducing in iOS 8?


648
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:42,646
Well, of course, managed books.


649
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:46,326
And just like managed
apps, managed books works


650
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:51,546
with both iBookstore books where
you can, just like managed apps,


651
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:55,446
tell the device to download
a particular iBookstore book


652
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:56,526
and treat it as managed.


653
00:29:57,316 --> 00:29:59,096
That that book must
be published,


654
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:02,156
purchased via VPP even
if the user has it.


655
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:07,126
One difference between managed
books and managed apps is


656
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,756
that you can retroactively
manage books


657
00:30:09,756 --> 00:30:11,096
in contrast to manage apps.


658
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:12,436
Even if the user
has it installed.


659
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:15,566
This is very useful
in schools to ensure


660
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,256
that a particular
title is installed,


661
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:19,226
make sure the students
have all their work


662
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:20,146
and the dog didn't eat it.


663
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:27,286
Turning to enterprise books, you
can, just like enterprise apps,


664
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:31,266
can install the MDM
and remove PDFs, ePubs,


665
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:32,496
and iBooks Author books.


666
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:36,746
These documents or
these titles are stored


667
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:38,736
in a different location
than iBookstore books


668
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:40,706
with Class C data protection.


669
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,176
There are also a
number of restrictions


670
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,096
that we're introducing
in iOS 8 to, again,


671
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:48,896
give institutions
more confidence


672
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:51,306
that the sensitive
data will be protected


673
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:53,526
and not escape their control.


674
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:57,496
They can disable iCloud backups
of these enterprise books


675
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:00,276
so that they just stay on the
device where they're installed


676
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:04,006
and also disable the
user's highlights and notes


677
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:06,376
on that title from being
synced to other devices.


678
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:09,966
For you MDM vendors out there,


679
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,876
it's going to be pretty straight
forward to implement this.


680
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:14,606
Just like there's an install
application MDM command,


681
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:17,086
there's now an Install
Media MDM command


682
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:20,766
where if it's a managed
iBookstore book,


683
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,826
you'll just specify
the iTunes store ID.


684
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:26,946
And if it's an enterprise
book, you'll specify a URL back


685
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:28,596
to your server to
download the bits.


686
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:32,316
You need to specify a persistent
ID that's under your control


687
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:35,236
so that you can uniquely
identify each enterprise book


688
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:37,236
that's being installed
and its kind


689
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:40,106
and then the matching
remove media command.


690
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:44,256
There are a few limitations.


691
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:48,046
Just like managed apps, is
requires the app installation


692
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,116
and the end enrollment, right,


693
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,696
to be able to install
managed books.


694
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:54,666
And managing iBookstore books
requires that you've, again,


695
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:58,096
purchased it via VPP and
that the App Store is enabled


696
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,376
on the device that you're
pushing an enterprise book to.


697
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,836
Another distinction
between managed apps


698
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:08,186
and managed books is that the
MDM query to obtain the list


699
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:11,136
of installed books will
only show managed books


700
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:13,406
and not every book that's
installed by the user


701
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:14,766
to preserve user privacy.


702
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:19,846
And finally, again, to allow
the institutions to keep control


703
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:21,806
over these enterprise books
and their sensitive data,


704
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:24,236
enterprise books cannot
be synced off a device


705
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,026
using iTunes.


706
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:29,066
So turning from what's
new in iOS 8 to what's new


707
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,046
in OS X Yosemite, we're
going to fill another gap.


708
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:34,826
And we are, have
added the ability


709
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:40,116
to install non App Store
apps via MDM on OS X.


710
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:40,896
Thank you.


711
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,546
[ Applause ]


712
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:47,226
You can thank you Jussi
when he gets back up here.


713
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:51,756
So you can specify a signed flat
package containing an app via


714
00:32:51,756 --> 00:32:54,546
this MDM command, the install
application MDM command


715
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:58,366
which is now supported on OS
X for non App Store books.


716
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:02,006
And, in fact, your MDM
solution can do the same thing


717
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:03,036
that Profile Manager has done


718
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:05,746
that you can support the
administrator's providing you


719
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:08,666
with just a .app bundle
as long as you package it


720
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:13,046
up as a signed flat package and
send that over the MDM command.


721
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:16,676
So without any further ado,
instead of talking more


722
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:19,026
about this, I'd like to ask
Jussi and Mark to come back up


723
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,496
and show you installing


724
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:23,046
and removing enterprise
apps and books.


725
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:24,806
>> All right.


726
00:33:24,926 --> 00:33:25,656
Thank you, Todd.


727
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:28,766
And I'm just going to go
into my iBooks library.


728
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:30,886
So here we have some books
that we already downloaded.


729
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,446
I've been a keen reader


730
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:34,176
of the Human Interface
Guidelines, apparently.


731
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:37,246
And we just downloaded the
Swift book so we're going


732
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:38,036
to learn some new things.


733
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,406
And Mark's now going to
push a PDF for the device.


734
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:43,766
So this is going to
be an enterprise book.


735
00:33:43,766 --> 00:33:47,976
And this is will have
the same open rules


736
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:51,496
as any other managed
assets on the device.


737
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,696
So we'll have data protection
between applications.


738
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:58,186
And we won't be able to
share the book anywhere else.


739
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:01,596
So this our fancy new PDF
that just got installed.


740
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:04,986
And now, since this is a
managed book controlled


741
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:08,516
by our MDM solution, Mark
can also remove the book.


742
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:11,726
So Mark can now remove the book


743
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:13,706
and it disappears
from our bookshelf.


744
00:34:13,996 --> 00:34:16,266
So that's managing
books on iOS 8.


745
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,146
And we're.


746
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,576
[ Applause ]


747
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:21,466
Thank you.


748
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:25,886
And on iOS we've had the Apple
Teaching Store enterprise


749
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:28,746
application so that we have
our fancy new Swift application


750
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:29,806
here, ACME Hub.


751
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:32,246
But as Todd mentioned,
we also have support


752
00:34:32,246 --> 00:34:34,286
for installing applications
on OS X.


753
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:38,116
So here we go into our
Launchpad and Mark is now going


754
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:39,866
to install our fancy ACME app


755
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:43,356
onto the OS X client
and no hands.


756
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:46,045
This is all installed
by the system.


757
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:49,626
So sparkles fly and the ACME
app landed on the system.


758
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:53,936
So over here's OS X using
the DEP app installation.


759
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:55,946
So thank you, Mark.


760
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:57,466
And now back to Todd.


761
00:34:58,156 --> 00:34:58,686
>> All right.


762
00:34:58,686 --> 00:34:59,716
Thank you very much, guys.


763
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:01,426
That app was written
using Swift, right?


764
00:35:01,686 --> 00:35:02,326
>> Of course.


765
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:03,976
>> They stayed up all night.


766
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:05,466
All right.


767
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:10,946
So Mark and Jussi just showed
installing a PDF on iOS 8 device


768
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:14,646
and removing it as well as
installing an enterprise app


769
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,376
on a Mac running OS X Yosemite.


770
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,196
So let's proceed on to
our final section and talk


771
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:22,146
about ongoing management
of devices.


772
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:26,076
We're going to complete
the Activation Lock story


773
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:27,956
to show you, to talk
about how you use


774
00:35:27,956 --> 00:35:30,386
that bypass code you
obtained at enrollment time.


775
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,636
Talk a little bit about
integrating you're MDM solutions


776
00:35:33,636 --> 00:35:35,076
with external data sources.


777
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:39,486
Talk about something new
called MDM service config.


778
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:41,016
We'll come on to that
in a few minutes.


779
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,286
And, then again, conclude
with what's coming


780
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:45,226
in this year's OS releases.


781
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:50,216
So one thing to keep in mind
with Activation Lock is,


782
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:53,216
it's a little bit different
from some other services.


783
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:55,916
When you get the device
information query,


784
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,576
and Mark showed this
in Profile Manager


785
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,876
when he re fetched
the device information


786
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:02,666
and it reflected the change
and Activation Lock status.


787
00:36:02,756 --> 00:36:05,116
There's a key that tells you
whether the device thinks it's


788
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:05,886
Activation Locked.


789
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:10,606
And there's a request that
you send not to the device,


790
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:13,756
but to our activation server
to clear the Activation Lock


791
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:16,336
and specify the bypass
code that you have.


792
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:19,696
Now, because that request
doesn't go to the device,


793
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:23,006
the device isn't checking
with the activation server,


794
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,926
it's not going to know
that it's been cleared.


795
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:26,536
So it's going to
continue to report


796
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:28,876
that it's Activation
Locked to your MDM server.


797
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:33,186
Also, even after
you have cleared


798
00:36:33,186 --> 00:36:36,146
on the activation server,
the user, if they log out of


799
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:38,426
or remove their Apple
ID and log in again,


800
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:40,026
that will re enable
Activation Lock.


801
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:41,736
So you want to definitely
keep hold


802
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,496
of that bypass code even
if you've cleared it.


803
00:36:43,796 --> 00:36:45,706
This isn't going to,
in the real world,


804
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,046
going to usually be an issue
because typically you're going


805
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:49,806
to use this when you have
the device in your hands.


806
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,406
But you definitely want
to keep that bypass codes


807
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:53,836
because you might
need to use it again.


808
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:57,886
All right.


809
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:01,296
So one of the most important
external data sources


810
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,596
that your MDM server
needs to integrate


811
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,396
with is directory services.


812
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:05,746
There are a number
of different ones


813
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:07,986
that your server
probably supports.


814
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:11,506
However, compared to
the database that's back


815
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:12,616
in your MDM solution,


816
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:15,746
most directory services
have some capabilities


817
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:17,996
which make them limited
in this context.


818
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:21,756
Usually you can't get a full
enumeration of their contents.


819
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:24,526
And there's not an easy
way to discover the changes


820
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:26,436
from the last time you
fetched some subsection


821
00:37:26,436 --> 00:37:27,306
of those contents.


822
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:30,556
They can be intermittently
available and slow.


823
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:32,696
So you're going to want
to need to mirror some


824
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:34,606
of the information
into your server.


825
00:37:34,996 --> 00:37:38,236
In contrast, we've designed both
the Device Enrollment Program


826
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:41,106
service and the Volume Purchase
Program service to be simple


827
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:43,996
and efficient to mirror that
data into your MDM solution.


828
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:46,946
You can fully enumerate
the licenses for VPP


829
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:49,316
or the device list for the
Device Enrollment Program.


830
00:37:49,786 --> 00:37:51,806
And it's easy to get the
changes from the last time


831
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:53,056
that you got the enumeration.


832
00:37:53,846 --> 00:37:55,436
So you should definitely
mirror this information


833
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:58,886
down in your database and
not use those services


834
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:01,816
for live access.


835
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:04,616
Similarly, you're
going to want to mirror


836
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,386
in the directory
services information


837
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:08,296
to get better performance
and reliability


838
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:11,006
and all the benefits
of your database.


839
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:13,096
But definitely leave
the authentication piece


840
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:14,226
in directory services.


841
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:16,086
It's less frequently
used, and you need


842
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,876
to have a single source
of truth for that.


843
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:20,196
Also, you're not going to want


844
00:38:20,196 --> 00:38:21,946
to mirror your entire
directory services


845
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:23,306
into your database, of course.


846
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:26,256
You want to just mirror in
records that are related to MDM.


847
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:32,316
Next, I want to talk about
a new concept that those


848
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:34,426
of you familiar with the
StoreBag from iTunes,


849
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:36,466
we could also call
this the URL bag.


850
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:40,116
It's something that would
make it much easier for tools


851
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:42,586
like Apple Configurator and
other device management tools


852
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:46,686
to just ask the MDM server what
information they can obtain


853
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:47,746
from it.


854
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:51,866
We specify this new
URI MDM service config


855
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:57,096
that any tool could then make
an unauthenticated HTTPS request


856
00:38:57,096 --> 00:39:01,616
to your server and ask for it to
provide a UTF8 JSON encoded hash


857
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:05,806
for example, the URL for your
MDM server's Device Enrollment


858
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:06,566
Program enrollment.


859
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:09,686
This would allow a tool
like Apple Configurator


860
00:39:09,686 --> 00:39:12,576
to make it much easier for
administrator to use it


861
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:14,806
to configure settings
because they wouldn't have


862
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:16,596
to type the entire
enrollment URL.


863
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:19,186
They'd only have to type
the domain of your server.


864
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:22,176
And it could then ask the
server what's your URL


865
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:23,476
and complete that for the user.


866
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:26,396
So we're going to
be implementing this


867
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:28,826
in Profile Manager and we strong
we would really like to see


868
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,406
that in your MDM
solutions as well.


869
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:35,556
So, again, let's turn to what's
coming new in iOS 8 in terms


870
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:37,316
of MDM commands and queries.


871
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:38,756
We've seen some of
these already.


872
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:42,136
But it's now possible for
supervised devices to tell them


873
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:44,076
to set their device
name via MDM.


874
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:47,426
You can also clear the
restrictions passcode


875
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,596
in the user has themselves
configured


876
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:53,126
in the settings UI
restrictions and set a passcode.


877
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:56,616
That would have prevented,
in the past the administrator


878
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:58,216
from overriding those
restrictions.


879
00:39:58,636 --> 00:40:02,046
Now, you can send an MDM command
that removes those settings


880
00:40:02,046 --> 00:40:05,426
and allows the MDM server to
configure its own settings.


881
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:07,556
We've already seen
the new install


882
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:11,306
and remove media commands
as well as the query


883
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:14,326
that allows you to ask which
iTunes account is configured


884
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:16,956
on the device via the
iTunes Store ID hash.


885
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:20,046
But it's also now possible
to query the device to ask,


886
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:21,946
when did it last
back up to iCloud?


887
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,646
There are a number of new
payloads and additions


888
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:28,346
to existing payloads in iOS 8.


889
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:31,106
There's a new VPN
connection type.


890
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:36,526
We've added new plug in content
filters to expand on the built


891
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:38,766
in content filters that
we shipped in iOS 7.


892
00:40:40,136 --> 00:40:42,036
There's a new payload,
called Managed Domains,


893
00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:43,686
which we're going to show
you a little bit later


894
00:40:43,686 --> 00:40:46,976
that you can have managed
email and web domains that work


895
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:50,236
in conjunction with managed apps
and books and managed open end


896
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:53,846
and help institutions
keep their data secure.


897
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:57,366
I think they actually mentioned,


898
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:00,146
Craig actually mentioned
the message S/MIME switch


899
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:01,256
in mail yesterday.


900
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:03,316
And it's possible to configure
whether that's available


901
00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:05,566
to you user for both
email and exchange.


902
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:09,616
You can specify a certificate
in the single sign-on payload


903
00:41:09,616 --> 00:41:13,056
that allows automatic refreshing
of the Kerberos credentials


904
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,076
without the user having
to take any action.


905
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,556
And there are a number
of new restrictions,


906
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:20,536
both for unsupervised devices,


907
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:24,596
the 5 at the top including
disabling the it's a really cool


908
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:29,356
feature Handoff, but that also
may worry certain institutions


909
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:32,646
about data that they consider
sensitive transitioning


910
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:36,126
from a managed device to another
device outside of their control.


911
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:39,346
We also already saw
the restrictions


912
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:40,626
on enterprise books.


913
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:44,816
And there are 2 new
supervised restrictions


914
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:47,866
that you can prevent the
user from erasing all content


915
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:49,866
and settings and wiping
the device and undoing all


916
00:41:49,866 --> 00:41:51,826
that hard work you did
to configure that device.


917
00:41:52,606 --> 00:41:55,696
As well as a pair
for the MDM command


918
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,586
that once you've
cleared the restrictions,


919
00:41:57,586 --> 00:41:58,966
you can disable the user


920
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:05,336
from actually configuring them
using the device UI in settings.


921
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:08,046
Speaking of the device
UI in settings,


922
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:10,036
the iOS team has
done a lot of work


923
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:12,496
to dramatically improve
the end user experience


924
00:42:12,836 --> 00:42:15,696
to see the effects
of an MDM enrollment


925
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,816
and any configuration profiles.


926
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:22,586
An MDM relationship is now
represented with a single item


927
00:42:23,046 --> 00:42:25,986
that coalesces all the
profiles that are installed via


928
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:29,576
that MDM channel showing
all the settings, apps,


929
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:32,036
and books that have come down
via that MDM relationship


930
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,766
with the most important
things likes accounts and apps


931
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:36,426
and books and restrictions
at the top.


932
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:38,256
What this also means is


933
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,056
that users cannot no
longer cherry pick


934
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:41,696
and remove individual profiles


935
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:43,896
that the MDM server has
delivered to the device


936
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:45,386
because they're just
not shown that way.


937
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:49,736
Another improvement
in the settings UI is


938
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,216
that if there are particular
features like the camera


939
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:55,886
or in the restrictions UI in
settings, it will indicate


940
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:59,286
to the user that this particular
feature has been disabled due


941
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:00,606
to a profile being installed.


942
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:04,876
So that they aren't confused
and need to come to Genius Bar


943
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:06,286
to ask them why their
camera's disabled.


944
00:43:08,426 --> 00:43:10,476
It's also much easier to see
all the certificate details


945
00:43:10,476 --> 00:43:12,106
that have been delivered
via MDM.


946
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:16,396
And finally provision profiles
no longer appear at all


947
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:19,036
in settings because it's handled
completely automatically.


948
00:43:19,426 --> 00:43:23,286
The device will automatically
prune expired provision profiles


949
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:23,976
when they're no longer needed.


950
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:27,926
[ Applause ]


951
00:43:28,426 --> 00:43:29,696
One less thing to worry about.


952
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:35,006
Turning to OS X Yosemite,
you'll see that we have support


953
00:43:35,006 --> 00:43:36,316
for a number of the
new payloads.


954
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:39,636
I already talked about on
iOS 8 as well as the query


955
00:43:39,636 --> 00:43:42,956
to determine which iTunes
account has been configured


956
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:43,916
on that particular Mac.


957
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:48,596
And we also have plugged another
gap in adding the command


958
00:43:48,596 --> 00:43:51,446
that tells a Mac to
initiate AirPlay Mirroring


959
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:52,406
to a destination.


960
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:56,356
So without further ado,
I'm going to ask the guys


961
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:59,156
to come back up and show you a
few things that I just talked


962
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:02,336
about and completing
the device duty cycle.


963
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:07,396
>> So we go to the settings and
we'll see what we have active


964
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:10,226
as manage settings
from our MDM server.


965
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:14,376
So you'll notice that you
don't have a profile setting


966
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:15,266
under general anymore.


967
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:16,756
This is called Device
Management.


968
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:20,296
If I just had regular
configuration profiles


969
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:22,886
installed, this tab
would be called Profiles.


970
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,086
If I have both Device
Management setting


971
00:44:25,356 --> 00:44:28,006
and Profiles installed it will
be called Device Management


972
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:28,536
and Profiles.


973
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:31,526
So but since we only have the
MDM enrollment profile here,


974
00:44:31,976 --> 00:44:33,446
I'm going to look into that.


975
00:44:33,446 --> 00:44:38,706
And, as you notice, this now
a non-removable MDM profile.


976
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,646
And you'll notice that
every single profile


977
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:44,286
that the server has
pushed is now collated


978
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:46,966
into some sensical category.


979
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:48,876
So we have restrictions
so you can tell


980
00:44:49,206 --> 00:44:51,586
which restrictions have been
configured by the server.


981
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:56,196
And we have applications that
have been installed here.


982
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:58,786
And we have also accounts
that have been configured.


983
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:01,396
So we don't show the
individual profiles


984
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:02,846
that actually configured this.


985
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,666
We just collate all
this information


986
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:07,406
so that's it's more readily
accessible and discoverable.


987
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:10,366
And in more details,
as Todd mentioned,


988
00:45:10,366 --> 00:45:12,946
we have better information
about certificates.


989
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:16,556
We can now actually see the full
signatures and how they keyed it


990
00:45:16,556 --> 00:45:18,296
up so it's not just
like dot, dot, dot.


991
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,836
And you can also
have information


992
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:23,766
about other settings
that come down.


993
00:45:23,956 --> 00:45:25,746
And here we have
managed domains.


994
00:45:25,746 --> 00:45:27,896
So I'm going to show
you managed domains.


995
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:29,836
How those are working in mail.


996
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:33,416
So we are in ACME, Inc.


997
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:34,886
in acmeinc.private.


998
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:37,766
And as I'm going to
start composing an email,


999
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:40,726
I'm going to pick
mark@mdm.apple.com.


1000
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,116
And this is now Mark's address.


1001
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:46,346
This is not something that I
should probably be sending email


1002
00:45:46,516 --> 00:45:48,266
to so it's marked as red.


1003
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:51,476
If I use a different address,


1004
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:55,656
use my acme in private mail
that's marked as a valid email


1005
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:58,676
that meets our email rules.


1006
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:00,736
And this also applies
to my sending account


1007
00:46:00,736 --> 00:46:03,426
so since I have configured
this device for iCloud,


1008
00:46:03,426 --> 00:46:05,016
I also have my iCloud account.


1009
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:08,566
So my iCloud account
is also marked


1010
00:46:08,826 --> 00:46:12,476
as not something I should
be sending mail with.


1011
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:15,276
So that's managed
domains inside mail.


1012
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:20,446
And then we are basically
done with the device.


1013
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,686
So now we can return
this device to service


1014
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:25,166
so the next user is going
to grab this machine.


1015
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:26,656
And what Mark's going to do,


1016
00:46:26,656 --> 00:46:30,236
he's going to issue an erase
command onto the device.


1017
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:34,196
So basically the user has left
the company or has graduated


1018
00:46:34,196 --> 00:46:36,966
from the school and
magic happens now.


1019
00:46:37,096 --> 00:46:39,086
So we're going to unplug
this device and plug


1020
00:46:39,136 --> 00:46:39,976
to a different device.


1021
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,166
So here we go.


1022
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:47,376
And now we have just
received the same device


1023
00:46:47,646 --> 00:46:49,846
and we're back in
the home screen.


1024
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:52,866
I'm going to as a new
user, I'm going to walk


1025
00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:55,726
through the setup screens
and configure this device.


1026
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:55,826
So.


1027
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:59,256
>> This a device that's come
back for the duty cycle.


1028
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:02,656
And I've got the Activation Lock
bypass code for this device.


1029
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:04,896
And so he's just
going to walk through,


1030
00:47:04,896 --> 00:47:07,536
go ahead, and set it up.


1031
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:11,116
And when he encounters the fact
that it's locked, I'll be able


1032
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:12,596
to clear it; and he'll be able


1033
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,656
to actually finish
activation and continue on.


1034
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,216
>> Right. So as soon
as the device talks


1035
00:47:18,216 --> 00:47:20,986
to the Apple services
again, I'm getting prompted


1036
00:47:20,986 --> 00:47:24,666
for some random Apple ID because
the previous user had enabled


1037
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:27,116
iCloud even though this
was a supervised device,


1038
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:29,956
we had allowed people
to use find my iPad


1039
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:33,236
and now I have no idea what
this user's account is,


1040
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:37,946
so Mark has just issued an
Activation Lock unlock command


1041
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:41,466
from Profile Manager
and if I now go back


1042
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:46,976
to the activation phase, now
I'm going to prompted to enroll


1043
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:50,586
in my MDM server, again all
ACME help desk for an issue.


1044
00:47:51,086 --> 00:47:53,836
And my next user is now
going to get prompted


1045
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:56,866
to enter their password,
and we're good to go.


1046
00:47:57,126 --> 00:48:00,456
So that's the duty cycle
of using iPads with MDM


1047
00:48:00,456 --> 00:48:02,306
and Device Enrollment Program.


1048
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:04,546
So thank you, Mark,
and back to Todd.


1049
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:07,886
>> So Jussi just gave you a
brief tour of the new easier


1050
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:11,736
to understand user interface
in settings in iOS 8.


1051
00:48:11,736 --> 00:48:15,376
Make it easier for a user to
understand what the impacts


1052
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:17,436
of that MDM relationship
is on their device.


1053
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:20,926
Showed you how managed
email domains work


1054
00:48:21,206 --> 00:48:25,866
to help users prevent data
leakage sending documents


1055
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:26,996
to the wrong email addresses.


1056
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:30,976
We also showed how to use the
Activation Lock bypass code


1057
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:33,906
that we captured when enrolling
device to enable the device


1058
00:48:33,906 --> 00:48:35,606
to be wiped and returned
to service


1059
00:48:35,886 --> 00:48:37,166
by completing the duty cycle.


1060
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:39,266
And, again, getting that device


1061
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:41,056
through Device Enrollment
Program settings


1062
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:42,856
to reenroll in your
MDM solution.


1063
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,086
That brings us to the
end of our session.


1064
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:48,166
I'd like to sum up for, again,


1065
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,776
the different audiences
for this session.


1066
00:48:49,996 --> 00:48:51,116
If you're an administrator,


1067
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:53,526
you should use the Device
Enrollment Program if you want


1068
00:48:53,526 --> 00:48:56,316
to enroll your devices
wirelessly or Apple Configurator


1069
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:57,356
if you want to do it wired.


1070
00:48:58,456 --> 00:49:00,926
You should use the Volume
Purchase Program managed


1071
00:49:00,926 --> 00:49:02,916
distribution and
managed apps and books


1072
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,836
to distribute content
to your devices.


1073
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:07,106
If you are a MDM
solution provider,


1074
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:09,366
please support all
these services:


1075
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,906
Device Enrollment Program,
Volume Purchase Program,


1076
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:14,306
and Activation Lock
management as well


1077
00:49:14,306 --> 00:49:16,136
as all the new futures
we talked about today


1078
00:49:16,266 --> 00:49:18,366
in both iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite.


1079
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,286
If you're an app developer,


1080
00:49:20,836 --> 00:49:24,166
for your enterprise we've got
this great new page that talks


1081
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:26,746
about how you can use
iOS to the best effect


1082
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:29,016
within your enterprise
doing in-house development.


1083
00:49:30,306 --> 00:49:31,966
We have a number of
resources, again,


1084
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:34,506
for developers both
MDM and app developers.


1085
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:37,116
Our documentation
of or MDM protocol,


1086
00:49:37,116 --> 00:49:38,756
the configuration
profile reference,


1087
00:49:39,206 --> 00:49:40,596
the developer forums for MDM.


1088
00:49:40,596 --> 00:49:43,596
And if there are any
administrators out there,


1089
00:49:44,116 --> 00:49:46,976
we've got documentation for
the Device Enrollment Program


1090
00:49:47,106 --> 00:49:50,036
and Apple Configurator and a
number of discussion boards


1091
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:52,436
that are great places to ask
your questions and get help,


1092
00:49:52,786 --> 00:49:54,646
both from your fellow
administrators


1093
00:49:54,646 --> 00:49:56,556
and Apple representatives.


1094
00:49:58,116 --> 00:50:01,466
There are a number of additional
sessions this week including 2


1095
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:03,826
following this session right
here in Pacific Heights.


1096
00:50:04,476 --> 00:50:07,896
Some of our colleagues that help
make that great new UI in iOS


1097
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:09,526
and implement a lot
of these features.


1098
00:50:10,026 --> 00:50:12,306
And with that, I will thank
you for your attention


1099
00:50:12,306 --> 00:50:14,166
and hope you have a
great rest of the show.


1100
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:14,856
Thank you.
