[ Applause ]


3
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:27,966
>> Hey, everyone.


4
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:29,946
Welcome to the AR design


5
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:30,466
session.


6
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:33,636
My name is Grant Paul, from the


7
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:34,966
human interface team at Apple.


8
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,606
And, I hope you've been having a


9
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:38,186
great WWDC this week.


10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,836
So, for this session, we're


11
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,616
going to start off by, I'm going


12
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:44,196
to talk about how to design


13
00:00:44,196 --> 00:00:46,626
great AR apps and games with the


14
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,916
user interfaces and


15
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:48,636
interactions.


16
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,716
And then, Omar's going to come


17
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:52,146
up, and he's going to tell you


18
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,916
all about making 3D models that


19
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:56,836
look great in AR, and feel great


20
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:56,956
in AR.


21
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:02,916
So, before we get to that, I


22
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,226
want to quickly talk about the


23
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:04,775
basics.


24
00:01:05,826 --> 00:01:07,646
So, if you're new to it, you


25
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:09,106
might be wondering exactly what


26
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:11,016
it is that we mean when we talk


27
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:11,606
about AR.


28
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:13,316
But, even if you're an AR


29
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:14,996
expert, I want to talk about


30
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:16,766
what we mean for this session.


31
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:20,566
So, AR, of course, stands for


32
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:21,646
augmented reality.


33
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,706
And, let's break down what that


34
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:25,316
means a little bit.


35
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:27,496
And, we can start with reality,


36
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:28,616
because it's a little bit easier


37
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:29,186
to get into.


38
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,516
So, reality means is that AR


39
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,456
deals with things in the real


40
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:34,876
world.


41
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:36,326
And, that's a little bit


42
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:37,736
different than other things we


43
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:39,016
might have done on our devices,


44
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,426
that take place on the device,


45
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,216
or they take place on the


46
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:43,736
internet.


47
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,516
But, with AR, things happen in


48
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:47,406
the real world.


49
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,806
They happen in the room around


50
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:51,796
you, in the environment you're


51
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:54,066
in, or in your place on the map.


52
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:54,946
Where you are.


53
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:56,946
But, the important thing is,


54
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:57,826
it's a little bit different.


55
00:01:58,356 --> 00:02:00,026
And the other part of augmented


56
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,506
reality, is augmented.


57
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,196
And, that can mean a few


58
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:03,976
different things.


59
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:06,236
So, augmented can mean -- it can


60
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:08,036
mean augmenting what you know


61
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:08,696
about the world.


62
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,386
It can mean getting information


63
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,636
that the device can understand


64
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:13,536
about the world, and giving that


65
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:14,116
to you.


66
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,196
It can mean placing virtual


67
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:17,526
things out into the world,


68
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,236
giving the virtual this physical


69
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:20,006
context.


70
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,676
And, it can mean taking


71
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,226
something that is real, like


72
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,466
your face, when you put an


73
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,826
animoji on as a mask.


74
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:27,436
Taking something that is real,


75
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,946
and enhancing it, augmenting it.


76
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:32,536
So, that's what we mean when we


77
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:33,506
talk about AR, when we talk


78
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:34,976
about augmented reality.


79
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:40,776
And, with that, I want to get to


80
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,156
the first half of this session.


81
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:43,676
I want to start talking about


82
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:45,546
how to design interfaces, and


83
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:47,356
design interactions for your AR


84
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:49,226
apps and your AR games.


85
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,126
And, the first part of that is


86
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:53,676
to talk about how to get people


87
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:54,466
into AR.


88
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:56,556
How to help guide people into


89
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:56,876
AR.


90
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,366
So, I'll show you how iOS 12's


91
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,576
built-in AR experiences help


92
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,716
guide people into AR.


93
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,606
And then, how you can take those


94
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,446
principles, and apply them in


95
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,466
your own apps.


96
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:10,206
Next, we'll talk about the


97
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:11,546
different ways you can present


98
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:12,596
content in AR.


99
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,836
The different possibilities that


100
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:17,106
ARKit opens up, and also some


101
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:19,046
tips and tricks that are great


102
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:20,306
no matter what kind of AR app


103
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:20,896
you're making.


104
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:23,866
And finally, we'll talk about


105
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,286
interactions in the world.


106
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:26,976
It's a little bit different when


107
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,616
you're building an AR app than


108
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:29,636
when you're building a 2D app,


109
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:31,386
for what kind of interactions


110
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:32,806
make sense, and what kind of


111
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:33,746
interactions you're going to


112
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:34,456
want to use.


113
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,056
So, we'll figure out what still


114
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:37,786
works great in AR, and then,


115
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:38,896
where we might need some new


116
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,036
kinds of interactions.


117
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,566
But first, I want to get started


118
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:44,946
with talking about how to get


119
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:45,706
into AR.


120
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:47,546
And, what I'm talking about here


121
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:49,476
is after somebody's downloaded


122
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:51,396
your app, after they've found


123
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:52,576
the AR experience in the app,


124
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,316
they've opened it up, what I'm


125
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:57,376
talking about here is when ARKit


126
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:58,936
needs to understand the world.


127
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:01,936
Because for every AR app, ARKit


128
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,076
needs some level of


129
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,286
understanding of the world in


130
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,876
order to start the AR


131
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:07,506
experience.


132
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,486
In order to get it going.


133
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,486
Because every AR app needs to --


134
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,376
needs that understanding in


135
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:14,666
order to place its objects into


136
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,446
the world, or show the user that


137
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:17,196
information.


138
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:20,266
And, the way ARKit builds that


139
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:22,065
understanding of the world, is


140
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:23,116
by getting you to move your


141
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:24,816
device, by having you move


142
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:25,186
around.


143
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,076
And, that's a little bit


144
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:29,346
different from other places that


145
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,846
you might have looked through a


146
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,456
device, seen a camera preview,


147
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,596
in the past.


148
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:35,386
Like, for example, when you're


149
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,096
taking a photo, you just need to


150
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:38,836
point the device where you want


151
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:39,636
to frame the shot.


152
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,066
But, in AR, you really do need


153
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,576
to start moving, looking at the


154
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,916
same place from different


155
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,466
positions, and looking at it


156
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:47,446
from some different angles.


157
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:51,056
So, the trick here is to let


158
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,746
people know what they need to


159
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:52,916
do.


160
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,476
Let them know how to move, that


161
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:55,426
they need to move their device.


162
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:57,416
And, the way to do that is to


163
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,826
give them a fixed reference.


164
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:00,266
Give them something to base that


165
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,296
understanding off of.


166
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:03,416
And, let's talk about that.


167
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,606
Let's take a look at an example.


168
00:05:05,676 --> 00:05:07,236
So, this is the game Euclidean


169
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:07,756
Lands.


170
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:09,546
And, what it's showing here, is


171
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:11,356
the device moving around inside


172
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:11,986
of a room.


173
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,936
And, that's really great,


174
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:15,376
because you can see here,


175
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,026
without any text exactly what it


176
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,866
is you need to do, that you need


177
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,366
to move the device within that


178
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:24,596
room, and just turning the


179
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:25,666
device to look at a different


180
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,496
angle isn't going to be enough.


181
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,406
So, without any text, it's


182
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,156
really clear from that fixed


183
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,976
reference of the room, exactly


184
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:35,346
what you need to do.


185
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:37,426
And, usually, most of the time,


186
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:38,606
that is all you're going to


187
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:38,976
need.


188
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:41,396
ARKit is even faster to build


189
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:42,746
that understanding of the world


190
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:44,096
in iOS 12.


191
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:47,136
So, in even more cases that is


192
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:48,316
all you're going to need.


193
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:49,956
You just need to start moving,


194
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,036
and you're ready to go.


195
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,056
But, of course, there are some


196
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:55,646
situations that aren't quite as


197
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,636
well suited to AR.


198
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,836
Maybe you're in a dark room, or


199
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:00,696
it's really reflective, and it's


200
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:04,026
not as easy to -- for ARKit to


201
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:04,796
start building that


202
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:05,606
understanding.


203
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,606
So, it can take ARKit a little


204
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,306
bit of time to get ready.


205
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:11,346
It might not happen immediately.


206
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,126
And, in those situations, if


207
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,236
you're still being told to move


208
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:16,526
your device, you're still


209
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:17,506
looking at something that says


210
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,336
to you, move your device around,


211
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,966
people might start to wonder,


212
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,936
why is the app not working?


213
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:25,356
Does the app not understand the


214
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,436
movement that they're making?


215
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:27,666
And, it might get -- start to


216
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,566
get confusing.


217
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:30,926
So, what you need is some kind


218
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:32,796
of feedback that lets people


219
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:34,156
know that they're not doing


220
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:35,046
anything wrong.


221
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:36,366
They're doing exactly what they


222
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,316
should be doing to get into AR.


223
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:39,916
And, they should just keep doing


224
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,066
it.


225
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:41,556
So, let's take a look at an


226
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:41,976
example.


227
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,146
So, this is how iOS 12's


228
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:50,426
built-in AR apps help guide


229
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:51,446
people into AR.


230
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:53,486
You can see the device moving


231
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:55,586
over the fixed reference of that


232
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:57,346
surface, by showing you that you


233
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:58,206
need to move it.


234
00:06:58,356 --> 00:06:59,456
You can't just keep it in one


235
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,576
place, or rotate it.


236
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:04,036
And then, once you've started


237
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:06,056
moving the device, the surface


238
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,616
transitions into a cube.


239
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:10,806
And, that cube spins with the


240
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,206
movement of the device, giving


241
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,666
you real, connected, direct


242
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,196
feedback that you're on the


243
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:16,916
right path, and you're doing the


244
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:17,506
right thing.


245
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,276
And then, once ARKit has built


246
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:21,406
that understanding, it's all


247
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,946
ready, the cube spins away, and


248
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,516
you're ready to go in your AR


249
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:25,966
experience.


250
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,896
So, that's how the built-in apps


251
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:33,256
in iOS 12 help guide people into


252
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:33,526
AR.


253
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,276
And, your apps should follow


254
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:36,446
those same principles.


255
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:38,636
They should help people know


256
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:39,476
that they need to move their


257
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,016
device, and give them that


258
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,126
feedback that they're doing the


259
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:42,806
right thing.


260
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,586
But, your apps don't need to


261
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:45,786
follow that same style.


262
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:46,666
They don't need to look like


263
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,066
line drawings.


264
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:48,886
AR should feel like an


265
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,306
integrated part of your app.


266
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:52,406
It should feel native to your


267
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,206
app's style.


268
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,466
And, it shouldn't feel like


269
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:56,256
something that's attached on, or


270
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:58,026
this flow is something that's


271
00:07:58,026 --> 00:07:59,106
added on after the fact.


272
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,186
So, the important part is to


273
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:02,556
help people down the right path,


274
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:04,136
but it should feel like part of


275
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:05,386
your app while you're doing


276
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:05,626
that.


277
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:09,026
And, the last thing I want to


278
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,446
talk about for helping get


279
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:12,156
people into AR, is that it's


280
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:14,676
important to balance your


281
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,176
instructions, your guidance, how


282
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,306
you're helping people get into


283
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:19,216
AR with being really efficient


284
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,646
when people already do know what


285
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:21,906
to do.


286
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:24,006
So, if somebody already knows


287
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,156
what to do, they're just going


288
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,216
to start moving their device


289
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:26,846
right away.


290
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:28,296
They don't need any kind of


291
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:29,236
instructions.


292
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:30,876
They don't need anything to tell


293
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:31,576
them to do that.


294
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:33,385
So, don't make them sit through


295
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:34,506
any kind of guidance.


296
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,496
Since ARKit is so much faster,


297
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,186
in a lot of cases, they'll start


298
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,035
moving, ARKit will understand


299
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:41,426
the world, and they'll be ready


300
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:41,936
to go right away.


301
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,326
Alright. So, that's getting into


302
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:48,606
AR.


303
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:50,226
That's how you help guide people


304
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:51,966
into your AR experiences.


305
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,626
Now, let's talk about how to


306
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:56,376
present your content in AR.


307
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:57,666
The different ways that you can


308
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,676
show things in AR, and tips and


309
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:02,126
tricks for all kinds of AR apps


310
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:02,886
and AR games.


311
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,356
And, I want to start with some


312
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:06,196
of the more radical


313
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,076
possibilities of things you can


314
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:08,906
build in ARKit.


315
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,266
Because not every AR experience


316
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,006
has to look like looking through


317
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,306
your device, seeing a camera


318
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,886
preview of the world, and then


319
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,566
placing objects out into space.


320
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,296
There are other options as well.


321
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,306
So, one of those options is to


322
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:25,836
build an AR experience entirely


323
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:26,886
in two dimensions.


324
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:28,566
You don't need to show a camera


325
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:29,246
preview.


326
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:30,696
You don't need any kind of 3D


327
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,376
graphics.


328
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,276
You're using that information


329
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,186
that ARKit gets about the world


330
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:38,546
to present a great AR


331
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:40,646
experiences entirely in 2D.


332
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:42,676
So, let's take a look at an


333
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:43,726
example of that.


334
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,166
This is the game "Rainbrow."


335
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:49,266
And, in Rainbrow, the way you


336
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,396
control you character is by


337
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:51,756
moving your eyebrows up and


338
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:51,956
down.


339
00:09:52,516 --> 00:10:11,500
[ Game Music ]


340
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:19,876
[ Applause ]


341
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,466
So, there's no need of any kind


342
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:23,546
of camera preview here.


343
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,686
There's no need for any 3D


344
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:26,216
graphics.


345
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,396
It's a lot more fun entirely in


346
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,736
2D, but it's still a great AR


347
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:31,396
experience.


348
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,976
So, that was AR in 2D.


349
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:36,936
But, another way, another thing


350
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,036
you can do with ARKit is you can


351
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:40,066
build things that I would


352
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,596
consider to be full virtual


353
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:42,946
reality experiences.


354
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,146
And, what I mean by that, is


355
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,476
that the experiences take you to


356
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:47,466
a different place.


357
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:49,106
They really make you feel like


358
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,166
you're somewhere else.


359
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:51,846
You can walk around the


360
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:52,556
environment.


361
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,016
You can move around within it.


362
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:55,616
You can look in all directions.


363
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,566
And, to me that makes something


364
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,706
really into a virtual reality


365
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,266
experience, even if it is


366
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,046
through a device.


367
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:04,676
And, there's some benefits to


368
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:04,946
that.


369
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,466
You don't need any extra


370
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:06,896
equipment.


371
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:07,786
It works everywhere.


372
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,246
You don't need to wear a headset


373
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:09,936
on your head.


374
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:11,706
It works everywhere you are with


375
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:12,856
the device you already have.


376
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:13,946
You don't need any kind of


377
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:15,446
trackers or anything else.


378
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,826
And, there's some benefits to


379
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,626
looking through a device rather


380
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,336
than being fully immersed.


381
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:22,336
Like, you're never going to


382
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,796
accidentally walk into a wall


383
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,116
because you always have your


384
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:25,986
peripheral vision.


385
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,496
So, ARKit can be a great way to


386
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:30,066
make virtual reality


387
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:30,826
experiences.


388
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,026
We'll take a look at one.


389
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:35,236
So, this is the virtual reality


390
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,706
experience called "Enter the


391
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:37,116
Room."


392
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,256
And, it was developed by the


393
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:39,636
International Committee of the


394
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:40,296
Red Cross.


395
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:44,056
And, in this experience, once


396
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:45,146
you walk into the room, you can


397
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,436
look around in all directions.


398
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:49,326
You can move closer to things.


399
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:50,316
You can inspect them.


400
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:51,496
You can move farther away.


401
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,086
And, the sound comes in, and it


402
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:55,536
feels like it's coming in from


403
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:56,796
outside the room, from all


404
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:57,306
around you.


405
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,446
And, that makes it into a really


406
00:11:59,446 --> 00:12:00,716
powerful experience.


407
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:03,496
And, that's what you can do with


408
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:05,326
virtual reality using ARKit.


409
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:08,356
So, those are some of the more


410
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:10,186
radical options of things that


411
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:11,396
you can build with ARKit.


412
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,986
We can also look at some tips


413
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,206
and tricks that make sense no


414
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:17,266
matter what kind of app it is


415
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:17,936
that you're building.


416
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:19,686
Whether it's a game, or a


417
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:21,736
productivity app, these can work


418
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:22,346
for everything.


419
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:25,286
So, the first thing I want to


420
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,256
talk about here is showing text


421
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:28,656
in AR.


422
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,546
Because text is really


423
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,056
important.


424
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,816
All kinds of AR apps have


425
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,776
different reasons to show text.


426
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,316
If it's a game, maybe you want


427
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,046
to show the title of a level, or


428
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:41,066
some instructions.


429
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,956
Or, maybe for other kinds of


430
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:44,046
apps, you want to label


431
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,896
something in the world, label a


432
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:46,866
virtual object.


433
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:48,696
Maybe show some annotations.


434
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:51,136
But, the important part, no


435
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,406
matter what reason it is that


436
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:54,116
you're showing this text, is to


437
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,546
keep that text readable.


438
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,836
Make it really easy to read.


439
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:01,706
So, the simplest way to show


440
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,826
text in AR, is to put it out


441
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:04,966
into the world, to put it in


442
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:05,616
perspective.


443
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:07,546
And, you know, that can look


444
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:08,286
really cool.


445
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:10,656
But, it also has some drawbacks.


446
00:13:11,386 --> 00:13:12,916
And, one of those drawbacks is


447
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,096
what happens when you look at it


448
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:15,286
from an angle.


449
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:17,066
The letters can, sort of, squish


450
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:17,656
together.


451
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:18,896
It can be a little hard to read.


452
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:21,576
And, another issue is what


453
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:23,126
happens when you take a step


454
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:24,096
back, when you're looking from


455
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:24,866
further away.


456
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:26,826
The text can get really small.


457
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:27,726
It's like trying to read a piece


458
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:29,616
of paper from all the way across


459
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:30,116
the room.


460
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:32,636
So, if you're showing titles, or


461
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:34,126
other kinds of things that maybe


462
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:35,246
people already know, or could


463
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:36,886
get in another way, it can be


464
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:37,946
really cool to show that in


465
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:38,596
perspective.


466
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,306
But, if you're showing something


467
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:41,636
that people really need to read,


468
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:43,736
need to get information from,


469
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:44,966
you might want to try a


470
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:45,706
different option.


471
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:48,986
So, a different option that you


472
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:51,036
can use, is to show your text in


473
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:51,866
screen space.


474
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,966
And, what I mean by screen


475
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,496
space, is that the text is


476
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,116
always the same size.


477
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:58,956
It's always facing you.


478
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,086
It's always head-on.


479
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:01,896
And, that makes it really easy


480
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:02,186
to read.


481
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,596
It doesn't have those problems


482
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:05,236
of what angle you're looking at,


483
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:06,946
or how far away from it you are.


484
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:09,546
But, the important part of


485
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:11,806
showing text in screen space, is


486
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:13,626
that it's still attached to a


487
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:14,706
position in the world.


488
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,976
It's still fixed to the place in


489
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,166
the world that you attach it to


490
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,476
an object, or attach it to some


491
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:21,366
physical feature.


492
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:24,166
And, that makes it really feel


493
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,866
like part of the AR scene.


494
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:28,796
So, screen space text is a great


495
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,096
way to label things, put some


496
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:32,646
annotations into AR, but still


497
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:33,946
make them really readable.


498
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:37,166
So, here's an example of screen


499
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:37,626
space text.


500
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,906
And, this is from Measure, which


501
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:41,126
is part of iOS 12.


502
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:43,046
When Measure shows the


503
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:44,616
measurements, it shows them in


504
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:45,626
screen space.


505
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,046
So, no matter what angle you're


506
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:48,016
looking at those measurements


507
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,866
from, or how far away you are,


508
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,756
they're always incredibly


509
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:51,976
readable.


510
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,126
So, screen space text is great


511
00:14:59,126 --> 00:14:59,956
for readability.


512
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:01,766
But, you should still try and


513
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:03,376
keep how much text it is that


514
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:04,946
you're actually showing in AR to


515
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,606
as little as possible.


516
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:08,756
And, the reasons for that is


517
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,126
when text is placed in the


518
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:12,226
world, you always have to keep


519
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,866
pointing your device at it in


520
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:14,546
order to read it.


521
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,346
If you turn your device to a


522
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,776
more natural reading position,


523
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:19,536
the text is going to go away.


524
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,916
So, if you have more detailed


525
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,376
text, if you're showing details


526
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:26,126
about some kind of object, or


527
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,756
something in the world, you


528
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:29,446
should show those details on the


529
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:30,126
display.


530
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:31,746
And then, people can use all


531
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:33,456
that experience that they built


532
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,996
up using iOS and reading things


533
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,636
on their devices, to read those


534
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,546
details directly on the display.


535
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:43,166
And, when you're showing those


536
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,276
details, when you're coming out


537
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,146
of AR, it's important to have a


538
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:46,896
transition.


539
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:48,916
Because those transitions can


540
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,016
make it really clear what it is


541
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:51,706
you're looking at.


542
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:55,066
What text, what object it is


543
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,786
that those details are


544
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:57,456
referencing.


545
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:58,886
What it is that you're getting


546
00:15:58,886 --> 00:15:59,706
details about.


547
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:02,526
So, let's look at an example


548
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:02,866
there.


549
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:04,476
And, this is also from Measure.


550
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,666
In Measure, when you tap on a


551
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,796
measurement, it comes out of AR


552
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,076
to show the details about that


553
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:13,256
measurement flat on the screen.


554
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,396
And that's great because it's


555
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:16,076
really easy to read.


556
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,626
You don't have to point your


557
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,126
device or your phone at the


558
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:20,616
measurement in order to read it.


559
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,396
But, it's also really clear,


560
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,826
because of the transitions.


561
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:27,746
The transitions show you what


562
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:29,966
measurement it is that you're


563
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,246
looking at details for.


564
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,786
And, they comes out of the


565
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:34,136
measurement, so you're never


566
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:35,186
going to be confused.


567
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:38,366
So, transitions.


568
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,036
They're really great when you're


569
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:42,006
coming out of AR, and going back


570
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:44,086
into AR, for showing details on


571
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:44,756
the display.


572
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:46,616
But, they're also really


573
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:47,916
important when you're just


574
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,206
showing objects in AR.


575
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,236
And, that's because it makes it


576
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:53,356
feel like there's one version of


577
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:53,996
the object.


578
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:55,946
It makes it feel like that


579
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,706
object has its own identity.


580
00:16:57,826 --> 00:17:00,186
And, that's important, because


581
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,996
things in AR are so physical.


582
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:04,165
They have that physical sense.


583
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:05,925
When you see them in AR, they


584
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:06,516
look real.


585
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:08,546
And, things in reality, you


586
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:09,455
can't just copy them.


587
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:10,516
You can't just make multiple


588
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:11,036
copies.


589
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,086
So, it's important to keep that


590
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,606
same principle when you're


591
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:16,056
showing objects in AR.


592
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:18,816
So, this is what happens when


593
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:20,366
you Quicklook at objects in AR.


594
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:22,856
And, it shows a great example of


595
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:23,915
keeping that identity.


596
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:25,566
When you switch from the object


597
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,096
tab to the AR tab, the object


598
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,006
stays in place.


599
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,366
It always stays visible.


600
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,856
It doesn't disappear and then


601
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:32,846
come from somewhere else.


602
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:35,086
And, even when you're deciding


603
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,586
where to place the object here,


604
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:39,576
it always stays visible on the


605
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:40,186
display.


606
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,446
So, it's really easy to see that


607
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,546
there's one version of this


608
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:43,996
object.


609
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,446
And, even when you go back into


610
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:47,726
the app that you were


611
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:50,166
Quicklooking the object from, it


612
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,906
still shows the object


613
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,076
transitioning back to where it


614
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:53,666
came from.


615
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,136
So, it feels like there's one


616
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,156
object moving between different


617
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,156
parts of your app.


618
00:17:58,486 --> 00:17:59,636
And then, into the world, and


619
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:00,516
back out of the world.


620
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:01,906
It doesn't feel like there's


621
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:02,726
multiple copies.


622
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:06,506
Alright. So, that was a bunch of


623
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,086
information in a row about the


624
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,006
different ways that you can


625
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,476
present your content in AR.


626
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:13,766
So, let's do a quick recap of


627
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:14,066
that.


628
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,586
So, first, we looked at the


629
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:17,996
different ways you can make AR


630
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,806
experiences, and we talked about


631
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:21,986
using AR to create entirely 2D


632
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:23,766
experiences, with no camera


633
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,296
preview, and no 3D graphics.


634
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:28,546
We talked about how VR can be a


635
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:30,136
great way to build experiences


636
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:31,876
with ARKit, and make you feel


637
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,486
like you're somewhere else, that


638
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,196
can be really powerful and


639
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:35,926
really immersive.


640
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,446
We talked about using screen


641
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:41,406
space to show text in AR, to


642
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:43,586
make it really readable from any


643
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:45,416
angle, and readable from any


644
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:45,876
distance.


645
00:18:47,186 --> 00:18:48,226
We talked about showing your


646
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,576
details on the screen, so that


647
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:51,516
they're easy to read without


648
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,406
pointing your device at some


649
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,036
specific place in the world.


650
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:57,396
And that you can use all of that


651
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:58,546
same knowledge that you've built


652
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:00,336
up reading things on iOS.


653
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:03,566
And finally, we talked about


654
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,766
transitioning into AR, and out


655
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:08,436
of AR, for showing details flat


656
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:09,266
on the display.


657
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,066
But, also to give objects that


658
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,676
sense of identity, that sense of


659
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:14,826
physicality that's so important


660
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:14,976
in AR.


661
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:21,246
Alright. So, that's presenting


662
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:22,026
content in AR.


663
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,196
So, different ways that you can


664
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:23,916
present it.


665
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,726
And some tips for different


666
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:27,246
types of content that you're


667
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:28,586
going to want to show in your AR


668
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:28,936
apps.


669
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:31,906
Now, let's talk about how we can


670
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,636
interact with that content.


671
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:35,006
Let's talk about interactions


672
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:36,736
that make sense in the world.


673
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:39,666
And, let's start with touch,


674
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:41,786
because touch has been really


675
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:43,646
important all the way back to


676
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:44,876
the beginning of iOS.


677
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:46,636
Multi-touch was there right from


678
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:48,286
the start, and it's been the


679
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,836
most important way to interact


680
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:50,586
with our devices.


681
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,026
And the reason touch is so


682
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,386
important, the reason touch is


683
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:56,506
so great, is that it enables


684
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:57,606
direct manipulation.


685
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:00,586
And, direct manipulation is when


686
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,116
you interact directly with


687
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:03,606
things on the screen, like


688
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:04,956
they're physical objects.


689
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,396
You're not using controls to


690
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:09,386
scroll or to pinch to zoom.


691
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:11,036
You're interacting directly with


692
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:11,696
the content.


693
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:13,126
It's like there's a physical


694
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,826
thing that you're manipulating.


695
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,646
And, that's even more important


696
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:18,286
in AR.


697
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:20,486
Because in AR, as I said before,


698
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:21,876
things are really physical.


699
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:23,306
Objects feel like they're real.


700
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:25,506
They feel like part of the real


701
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:25,966
world.


702
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,286
So, it's really important to use


703
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,866
direct manipulation to make it


704
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:30,926
feel like you're interacting


705
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,726
directly with those objects.


706
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,226
And, direct manipulation is also


707
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:38,496
great because it uses gestures


708
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:40,166
that you already know, that you


709
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,716
have experience with from iOS.


710
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,226
Because those gestures will be


711
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:46,116
the same as any other content on


712
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:46,326
iOS.


713
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,456
They're things that you've been


714
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,396
using for probably a long time.


715
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,836
So, the first one there is how


716
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,036
you can move objects in AR with


717
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:57,056
direct manipulation.


718
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,246
If you want to move objects, you


719
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:00,256
just put your finger down and


720
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,516
drag them to a new place.


721
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:02,756
And, it feels like you're


722
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,526
picking up the object, because


723
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:05,716
it stays under your finger.


724
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:07,346
You get this physical connection


725
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:08,796
to the thing that you're moving.


726
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,606
Another gesture you can do, is


727
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,796
scaling objects.


728
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:17,226
So, in AR, things start out at


729
00:21:17,226 --> 00:21:18,466
their physical size, at their


730
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,506
natural size.


731
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:21,146
But, if you want to change that,


732
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:22,736
you can pinch the object to make


733
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:23,216
it bigger.


734
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:24,766
And, you can pinch out on the


735
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,836
object if you want to make it


736
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:26,376
smaller.


737
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,246
The important things to think


738
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,206
about when you're scaling


739
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,176
objects in AR, is to give some


740
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:32,436
feedback when you're doing it.


741
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,016
Because the change is really,


742
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,406
really big when you take an


743
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:36,796
object and scale it up to 4


744
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,666
times the size.


745
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:40,036
So, it's important to give


746
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:41,466
people feedback, so they


747
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,726
absolutely know what happened.


748
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:44,996
And, the second thing is to make


749
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:47,056
it really easy to go -- to take


750
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,636
the object back to its natural


751
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:49,146
size.


752
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,536
Back to the size that it would


753
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:51,846
be in the physical world.


754
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:54,496
So, you can snap back to 100%,


755
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:56,186
maybe with a haptic, to make


756
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:56,966
that really easy.


757
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,316
Another thing you can do is


758
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:03,366
rotate objects, by putting two


759
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:04,946
fingers on the display, and


760
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:06,036
twisting to rotate.


761
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,296
And, that can be really great,


762
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:09,606
but with all of these two finger


763
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:11,286
gestures, another thing you


764
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,986
should think about is your tap


765
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:13,546
targets.


766
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,866
Because things in AR are always


767
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:16,786
moving as you're moving the


768
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:18,586
device, and they can get really


769
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,086
small if you get further away,


770
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:21,206
or if you scale them down.


771
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:22,546
You should make sure to use


772
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:24,406
really generous tap targets.


773
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,096
So, it's easy to land two


774
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,396
fingers on the object.


775
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,556
And, be sure to use the center


776
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,656
of those two finger touch


777
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:33,406
positions to figure out which


778
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:34,526
object to interact with.


779
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:35,826
Because you might not be able to


780
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:38,156
land two whole fingers, even on


781
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,766
a generous tap target in AR.


782
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:43,676
Alright, so direct manipulation


783
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,126
is really great in AR.


784
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:46,806
It's really important because AR


785
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:47,536
is so physical.


786
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:50,686
But, it's also not quite enough


787
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:51,696
for most AR apps.


788
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:53,346
Because if you have a lot of


789
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:54,406
objects, it can make it hard to


790
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,376
touch the right one.


791
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:56,936
As I said before, the objects


792
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:59,366
are always moving on the display


793
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:00,296
as you're looking at different


794
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,166
places in the world.


795
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:02,456
And, they're staying fixed to


796
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:03,446
that place in the world.


797
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:05,256
So, it can be a little hard to


798
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,096
aim for those objects on the


799
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:07,666
screen.


800
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:10,786
But, the fundamental reason, the


801
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:12,226
number one reason, the real


802
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:15,206
reason that touch is not enough


803
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,266
for AR apps, is that it's


804
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,826
fundamentally two-dimensional.


805
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:20,846
The surface of the display is


806
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,006
two-dimensional, and you're


807
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:23,236
touching on that surface.


808
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,126
That is what made it so great,


809
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:27,566
multi-touch so great for flat,


810
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:28,936
2D apps in iOS.


811
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:31,376
But, AR content, it's placed


812
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,026
into the world.


813
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:33,226
It's part of the world.


814
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,856
So, that means we need some way


815
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:37,266
to interact with that content


816
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:38,846
also in three dimensions.


817
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,196
Because the world is


818
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:40,866
three-dimensional.


819
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:44,566
The answer there is moving your


820
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:45,186
device.


821
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:47,026
Because moving your device, it's


822
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,436
natively three-dimensional.


823
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:49,686
It's three-dimensional


824
00:23:49,686 --> 00:23:50,286
inherently.


825
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:51,966
You can move up and down.


826
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:53,126
You can move left and right.


827
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,826
You can move forward and back.


828
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,506
You can turn in all directions.


829
00:23:56,506 --> 00:23:58,446
You can stand up and move across


830
00:23:58,486 --> 00:23:59,826
the room if you want to go a


831
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:00,666
little bit further.


832
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,746
But, the important part is that


833
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,446
moving your device is fully


834
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:06,236
three-dimensional, and that


835
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,676
really makes it the number one,


836
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:09,756
the primary interaction in AR.


837
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,506
In fact, I would say that moving


838
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,166
your device is more important


839
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:17,096
than touch for AR apps.


840
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:18,766
In fact, it's so natural, it's


841
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:21,356
built in to every AR app by


842
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:21,886
default.


843
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:23,156
The way that you look at


844
00:24:23,156 --> 00:24:24,726
different things in AR is by


845
00:24:24,726 --> 00:24:26,676
moving your device to look at it


846
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:27,886
from different angles, and


847
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:28,726
different positions.


848
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,206
So, it's really natural, and


849
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:32,506
it's also really powerful.


850
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:35,506
And, moving your device, it


851
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,066
accomplishes many of the things


852
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:38,766
that you would have done in a 2D


853
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,746
app by using multi-touch.


854
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:42,846
So, in a 2D app, if you want to


855
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:44,756
see more content, the way you do


856
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:45,996
that is by scrolling on the


857
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:46,646
display.


858
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,446
You scroll down to see something


859
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:48,726
new.


860
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,206
And, that's great in a 2D app,


861
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:54,656
but in AR, you do that in 3D.


862
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:56,456
You see different content, by


863
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:59,006
moving your device to look at


864
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:00,326
the content from different


865
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:01,806
positions, and from different


866
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:02,266
angles.


867
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,586
So, it solves that same problem


868
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,196
of wanting to see more, but it


869
00:25:06,196 --> 00:25:07,376
solves it fully in three


870
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:07,996
dimensions.


871
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:11,096
Similarly, in a traditional 2D


872
00:25:11,096 --> 00:25:11,956
app, if you want to see


873
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:13,786
something bigger, you pinch in


874
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:14,696
on it to make it bigger.


875
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:15,676
You pinch to zoom.


876
00:25:16,026 --> 00:25:17,806
If you want to see it smaller,


877
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:19,216
you pinch out.


878
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,126
You pinch to zoom out.


879
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:24,096
But, in AR, if you want to see


880
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:25,546
something bigger, you can just


881
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:26,666
get closer to the thing you're


882
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,106
looking at.


883
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:28,346
You can just move closer in.


884
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,116
And, if you want to see more


885
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,716
things at once, you want to see


886
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:34,046
things from a wider angle, you


887
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:35,976
can just take a step back, and


888
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:37,156
look at all of the content at


889
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:37,516
once.


890
00:25:38,646 --> 00:25:41,426
So, moving your device, it also


891
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:42,906
replaces what you might have


892
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,546
done by pinch to zoom to see


893
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:47,816
more content in a 2D


894
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:48,536
application.


895
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:52,116
So, movement is really great.


896
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:53,756
It can replace some of those


897
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:54,596
things you might have used


898
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,506
multi-touch for.


899
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,846
You can also use it to build


900
00:25:57,846 --> 00:26:00,396
totally custom interactions for


901
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:01,026
your AR apps.


902
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,786
And, those can be really


903
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:03,326
natural.


904
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,456
Just like using your device to


905
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:06,736
look around at different things,


906
00:26:06,736 --> 00:26:07,766
or to get closer and further


907
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,186
away.


908
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:09,856
So, let's take a look at an


909
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:10,726
example of that.


910
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:12,886
This is Swiftshot, the


911
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,576
multiplayer AR sample game that


912
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:15,506
you might have seen in the


913
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:16,306
Keynote, or you might have


914
00:26:16,306 --> 00:26:16,996
actually tried it.


915
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:19,556
In order to fire a slingshot in


916
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,246
Swiftshot, the way you do it is


917
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,586
you move close to that


918
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:23,136
slingshot.


919
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:24,266
You don't have to pick which


920
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,296
slingshot you're going to fire


921
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:25,976
from a list.


922
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:27,296
You don't have to reach out and


923
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,256
try and aim for it on the


924
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:28,726
screen.


925
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:30,906
You just move close to it, and


926
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:31,716
when you want to fire the


927
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,516
slingshot, you just pull back


928
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:34,016
and release.


929
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:37,046
So, it's incredibly precise,


930
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,516
because you can fire in three


931
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:39,386
dimensions.


932
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,366
You have three dimensions of


933
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,976
precision while you're moving


934
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:42,886
that slingshot, while you're


935
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:43,546
pulling it back.


936
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:45,406
And, that's more than you could


937
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,156
ever do using touch.


938
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:49,196
So, moving your device, it's not


939
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:50,786
only really natural, but it's


940
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:52,866
also more precise than you could


941
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:57,836
ever do using touch in AR apps.


942
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,756
So, moving your device is great,


943
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,906
but sometimes we need to combine


944
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,026
the best of touch and the best


945
00:27:04,026 --> 00:27:05,926
of device movement to create the


946
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:07,336
absolute best interactions.


947
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:09,956
So, let's look at some examples


948
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:10,326
of that.


949
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:12,226
And, let's start with combining


950
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:14,626
direct manipulation with moving


951
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:16,546
your device.


952
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,086
So, Quicklook in AR also offers


953
00:27:19,086 --> 00:27:20,936
a great example of combining


954
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:23,166
device movement and direct


955
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,216
manipulation in AR.


956
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:27,386
If you want to move an object,


957
00:27:27,386 --> 00:27:29,056
of course, you can just drag it


958
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:30,736
to the new position, the same as


959
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:31,596
you saw before.


960
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,116
Touch on the screen and move it


961
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:33,906
to a new place.


962
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:35,886
But, you could also touch down


963
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:37,706
to pick up the object and then


964
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,586
turn the device and release in a


965
00:27:39,586 --> 00:27:40,156
new place.


966
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:42,336
And, that's great, because it


967
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:43,076
gives you the full


968
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:44,736
three-dimensional control of


969
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:46,016
moving your device to pick where


970
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:46,806
you're going to place it.


971
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:49,226
And, it lets you move objects to


972
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:50,586
places that you can't see on the


973
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,316
screen, by picking them up and


974
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:52,716
turning.


975
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:54,896
But, it still keeps that sense


976
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:56,126
of physical interaction.


977
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,266
That sense of direct


978
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,666
manipulation that you had from


979
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,166
picking up the object directly.


980
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,006
So, if you support any kind of


981
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:06,086
moving objects in AR in your


982
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:07,916
apps, you should definitely


983
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,786
support picking up an object


984
00:28:09,946 --> 00:28:11,526
with direct manipulation, and


985
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,586
moving the device to find a new


986
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:17,726
place to put it.


987
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,686
Alright. So, moving your device


988
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:22,016
and direct manipulation is one


989
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,356
way to combine touch.


990
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:25,766
But another way to combine touch


991
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,386
with moving your device is


992
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,826
through indirect controls.


993
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:30,746
And, what I mean by indirect


994
00:28:30,746 --> 00:28:31,736
controls, are controls that are


995
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:33,176
flat on the display.


996
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:35,246
They're not placed in the world.


997
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,006
They're not attached to


998
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:36,526
anything.


999
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,466
They're in a consistent position


1000
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,176
on the display, and you can


1001
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,176
learn that position.


1002
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:42,566
And, that's really great,


1003
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:43,576
because that means they get out


1004
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:44,156
of the way.


1005
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:45,256
Once you've learned that


1006
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,936
position of that control on the


1007
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:49,336
display, it stays in one place.


1008
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,586
You can rest your finger above


1009
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:51,986
it while you're speeding your


1010
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:54,036
time focusing on the rest of the


1011
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:54,326
app.


1012
00:28:54,326 --> 00:28:56,846
So, let's look at an example of


1013
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:57,336
that.


1014
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,416
Here's Zombie Gunship AR.


1015
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,996
You're flying in a gunship above


1016
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:03,616
a horde of zombies, and you


1017
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,496
really need to aim at them.


1018
00:29:04,496 --> 00:29:05,706
You want to focus on aiming.


1019
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:07,156
You don't want to focus on


1020
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:08,516
moving your finger, trying to


1021
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:09,486
figure out where you need to aim


1022
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,126
your finger on the display in


1023
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:12,476
order to fire.


1024
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:14,866
Instead, you can just rest your


1025
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,376
finger above the fire button,


1026
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:18,586
and spend all of your time using


1027
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,256
that full 3D precision of moving


1028
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,116
your device in order to aim


1029
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:23,326
where it is you're firing, to


1030
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:24,356
aim at those zombies.


1031
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,686
So, indirect controls are really


1032
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:31,426
great combined with moving your


1033
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:31,836
device.


1034
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:33,716
But, they're also really great


1035
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,286
because they let apps work


1036
00:29:35,286 --> 00:29:36,036
one-handed.


1037
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:39,256
In AR, no matter what, you


1038
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:42,106
always have to use one hand to


1039
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:43,056
control where it is that you're


1040
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:44,366
looking, at least one hand.


1041
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:45,806
So, if you want to build a


1042
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:47,916
one-handed AR experience, you're


1043
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:48,786
going to need to use really


1044
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,356
reachable controls that are


1045
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,026
really easy to access.


1046
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:55,536
So, an example of that is


1047
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:55,936
Measure.


1048
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:57,786
Measure uses an indirect


1049
00:29:57,786 --> 00:29:59,366
control, the plus button, the


1050
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:00,346
add button at the bottom of the


1051
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:01,976
screen to add points.


1052
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:04,696
And, that control is in a really


1053
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:05,566
reachable spot.


1054
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:07,086
So, even while you're using one


1055
00:30:07,086 --> 00:30:09,026
hand to focus the reticle on the


1056
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:10,946
center of the screen, to


1057
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:11,906
precisely place your


1058
00:30:11,906 --> 00:30:13,546
measurements, you can keep a


1059
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,046
finger placed above that plus


1060
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,716
button to easily add your


1061
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:17,846
measurements, to easily place


1062
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:18,436
those points.


1063
00:30:19,576 --> 00:30:22,096
So, using indirect controls can


1064
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:24,026
be a great way to make it not


1065
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:25,846
only easy to use AR experiences,


1066
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:31,286
but one-handed ones as well.


1067
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,196
Alright. So, that's how to pick


1068
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:34,476
interactions for AR.


1069
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:36,566
You can use direct manipulation


1070
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:37,486
to give that sense of


1071
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:39,236
physicality, and physical


1072
00:30:39,236 --> 00:30:40,006
interaction.


1073
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:41,716
You can move the device, the


1074
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:43,486
primary interaction in AR.


1075
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:45,056
And, you can use really


1076
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:47,086
reachable indirect controls to


1077
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:48,896
focus on the content, rather


1078
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:51,036
than on controls or buttons


1079
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:51,846
interacting with it.


1080
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:54,086
And, that's what I wanted to


1081
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,066
talk to you about today.


1082
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,626
Getting into AR, guiding people


1083
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:59,006
down the right path, and giving


1084
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:00,786
them that direct feedback that


1085
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:01,896
they're doing the right thing.


1086
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:03,706
The ways you can present your


1087
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:06,866
content in 2D and VR, and how


1088
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,826
you can show content to make it


1089
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,316
easy to read, and give objects


1090
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:11,436
that physical identity


1091
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,006
transitioning in and out of AR.


1092
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:15,666
And, the interactions that you


1093
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,286
can use in the world, especially


1094
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:20,016
and primarily moving your


1095
00:31:20,016 --> 00:31:20,646
device.


1096
00:31:20,936 --> 00:31:23,276
So, now I want to bring up Omar,


1097
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:24,256
who's going to talk about making


1098
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:26,126
your models, your 3D models look


1099
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:27,376
really great in AR.


1100
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:27,976
Thank you.


1101
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:35,500
[ Applause ]


1102
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:40,936
>> Thanks, Grant.


1103
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:45,726
Hey, everyone.


1104
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:47,916
I'm really excited to be up here


1105
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:48,956
to talk about some best


1106
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:51,056
practices that you need to keep


1107
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:52,036
in mind while you're developing


1108
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,396
your content for your AR


1109
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:55,136
experiences.


1110
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:57,756
So, we have a lot of different


1111
00:31:57,756 --> 00:31:58,786
pieces of information to cover


1112
00:31:58,786 --> 00:31:59,156
today.


1113
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:00,896
And, whether you're an engineer,


1114
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,736
designer, manager, or an artist,


1115
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:05,816
we wanted to provide you with a


1116
00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:08,046
utility belt of tactics and


1117
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:09,716
definitions, so that you are


1118
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,056
best equipped to craft your own


1119
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,696
exceptional AR contents to


1120
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:14,626
delight people with.


1121
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,766
So, to begin with, let's start


1122
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,336
with some essential concepts to


1123
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:20,376
keep in mind while you're


1124
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:22,206
developing your AR experience.


1125
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:25,036
AR is incredible.


1126
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:27,176
Having the ability to take


1127
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:28,626
anything you can imagine, and


1128
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:29,966
place it into the real world is


1129
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,016
absolutely magical.


1130
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:32,826
And, because of this, people


1131
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,766
tend to expect a lot out of


1132
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:35,876
their AR experiences.


1133
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,326
They expect your 3D content to


1134
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:40,756
render at a smooth and


1135
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:41,586
consistent rate.


1136
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:43,756
It's incredibly distracting when


1137
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:44,946
you're really engaged with the


1138
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,776
content, and you start to move a


1139
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:49,086
bit closer to it, and then, you


1140
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:50,456
want to appreciate those fine


1141
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:51,956
details, and all of a sudden,


1142
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:52,626
wham!


1143
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:54,946
Poor optimization has caused


1144
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:56,616
performance to tank, and now


1145
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:57,446
it's as if you're watching a


1146
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:58,126
slideshow.


1147
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,936
So, to ensure your -- the most


1148
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,216
smoothest performance at all


1149
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:04,846
times, and to keep people fully


1150
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:07,456
engaged with your AR scene, your


1151
00:33:07,456 --> 00:33:08,366
app needs to render at a


1152
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,066
recommended target of 60 frames


1153
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:10,576
per second.


1154
00:33:11,176 --> 00:33:13,326
Now, it's really important to


1155
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,286
maintain this target throughout


1156
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,416
the entire experience.


1157
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,746
Really stress test your content.


1158
00:33:19,086 --> 00:33:20,276
View it from every possible


1159
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:20,636
angle.


1160
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:22,636
You know, move in close, move


1161
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:24,006
back from it, and just make sure


1162
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:25,236
that the performance does not


1163
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:25,876
ever degrade.


1164
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:29,566
You know, maybe someday in the


1165
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:31,046
future, batteries will run for


1166
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:31,326
days.


1167
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:33,336
But, today, make sure that your


1168
00:33:33,336 --> 00:33:35,716
experience is able to have as


1169
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:37,146
minimal of an impact to battery


1170
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,326
life as possible.


1171
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,536
Don't give people the chance to


1172
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:41,976
blame your app for draining


1173
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:42,466
their battery.


1174
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,566
The more power you save, the


1175
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,666
more you want people to come


1176
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:46,906
back to your experience and try


1177
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:47,296
it again.


1178
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:50,476
I mean, I don't know about you,


1179
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:51,696
but whenever I see a battery


1180
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,906
indicator in this stake, I


1181
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,136
seriously feel like I'm going to


1182
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,046
have a panic attack.


1183
00:33:55,376 --> 00:33:56,516
And, we definitely don't want to


1184
00:33:56,516 --> 00:33:57,896
have our AR experiences cause


1185
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:59,466
widespread battery chaos


1186
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:00,536
throughout the lands.


1187
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,876
Remember, only you can prevent


1188
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,166
excessive battery drain.


1189
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,876
I like to look at AR as having


1190
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,216
the power to take anything you


1191
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,085
can imagine and to transport


1192
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:12,826
into the real world.


1193
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,866
People want to explore your


1194
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:16,826
content, so you definitely want


1195
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:17,606
to bring your A game.


1196
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:19,755
Take the time to craft those


1197
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,286
nuanced details into your 3D


1198
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:21,786
content.


1199
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:23,786
Build a cohesive story and


1200
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:24,315
style.


1201
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:25,866
And, remember that every little


1202
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,456
detail, every little touch is an


1203
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,315
opportunity to surprise people.


1204
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:32,606
So, let's say we wanted to make


1205
00:34:32,606 --> 00:34:34,485
an AR experience to be about an


1206
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:34,996
aquarium.


1207
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:37,536
Even in its most abstract form,


1208
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:38,606
I think I would be really


1209
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:39,755
hard-pressed to find anybody who


1210
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:40,806
would believe that this


1211
00:34:40,886 --> 00:34:42,176
marshmallow blob represents a


1212
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:42,585
fish.


1213
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,306
On a positive note, though, our


1214
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,406
app will pretty much rock the


1215
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:47,815
performance numbers if this


1216
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,056
little guy's flopping around.


1217
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,505
So, let's try that again.


1218
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:54,636
Ah, now this is much better.


1219
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:56,496
That is one properly


1220
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:57,386
dead-looking fish.


1221
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,856
See how it exhibits some nice


1222
00:34:59,856 --> 00:35:01,416
details, that once it's running


1223
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,766
in AR will really want to entice


1224
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:05,036
people to move closer to it to


1225
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,126
see all those nuanced details


1226
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:08,726
and explore its features.


1227
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:10,906
We should strive to maintain


1228
00:35:10,906 --> 00:35:12,386
this level of quality with all


1229
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:13,446
the fishes swimming in our


1230
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,426
aquarium, or just floating in


1231
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:17,046
the top in this case.


1232
00:35:17,836 --> 00:35:19,276
Finally, it's important to


1233
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:20,516
remember that people really want


1234
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:21,646
to use your app in a wide


1235
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:22,596
variety of environments.


1236
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:24,406
You want to avoid having your


1237
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:27,136
content stand out in real world


1238
00:35:27,136 --> 00:35:29,136
locations where potentially the


1239
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:30,516
lighting ambient conditions


1240
00:35:30,516 --> 00:35:31,816
could conflict with the story


1241
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:32,626
that you're trying to tell.


1242
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:34,856
So, when working with your


1243
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:36,416
assets, try to avoid using


1244
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,146
colors that are either too


1245
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:39,266
bright or too dark.


1246
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:40,846
And, make sure that you light


1247
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:42,206
your AR scene in a way that it


1248
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,026
casts even lighting on all the


1249
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,416
objects that you're planning to


1250
00:35:45,836 --> 00:35:46,966
render, and at no matter what


1251
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:48,046
angle you view them from.


1252
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,546
You want your AR content to work


1253
00:35:50,546 --> 00:35:51,926
whether it's day or night.


1254
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:54,116
Now, spoiler alert, we're going


1255
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:55,406
to go over some really nice


1256
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:57,256
features in ARKit that will


1257
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,916
enable you to really delight


1258
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,476
people when they see your AR


1259
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,426
content blend and react


1260
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,956
seamlessly to the real world


1261
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:04,426
environment.


1262
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:08,126
So, as you're building your AR


1263
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,196
content, one great tool to help


1264
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:11,486
evaluate your progress is by


1265
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:12,976
using one of our recent


1266
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:15,046
announced iOS 12 features, AR


1267
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:15,496
Quicklook.


1268
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:17,876
Throw some of your assets up on


1269
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,706
iCloud drive, view them using


1270
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:21,926
the Files app on iOS, and


1271
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,096
quickly have the ability to


1272
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:24,346
project it into AR.


1273
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:28,826
Heck, you can even show off your


1274
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:30,586
masterpiece by throwing it onto


1275
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:32,036
a website so that your friends


1276
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,396
can look it up, and you can view


1277
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:34,946
it anywhere, right from Safari.


1278
00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:37,056
It's pretty awesome.


1279
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:38,796
Definitely go back and check out


1280
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,296
the session with Dave and David,


1281
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,786
who go over details of best


1282
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:43,986
practices of how you use AR


1283
00:36:43,986 --> 00:36:46,286
Quicklook, and I'm guarantee


1284
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:47,346
you, it'll probably change your


1285
00:36:47,346 --> 00:36:48,236
life with how you develop your


1286
00:36:48,236 --> 00:36:48,756
assets.


1287
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:52,316
So, now you've taken some time


1288
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:54,126
to consider what people expect


1289
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,896
from our AR experience, let's


1290
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,246
quickly plan out what type of


1291
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:58,516
app we're going to build today.


1292
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:00,196
You know, it's always a good


1293
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:02,046
idea to start thinking this


1294
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:03,836
through before you begin


1295
00:37:03,936 --> 00:37:05,146
creating your 3D content.


1296
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:07,196
As knowing what you want to make


1297
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:08,926
will help narrow down how best


1298
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,006
to optimize your content and


1299
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:12,666
your assets for AR.


1300
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,436
So, you're sitting at your desk,


1301
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:17,006
and suddenly you're struck by


1302
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:17,596
inspiration.


1303
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:19,146
You just came up with the most


1304
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:21,116
absolute brilliant AR experience


1305
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:21,506
ever.


1306
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:23,996
Alright? So, let's step back and


1307
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:25,326
ask ourselves a couple questions


1308
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:25,806
first.


1309
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:28,376
Does this experience really need


1310
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,556
to render hundreds of AR


1311
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:32,166
objects, or will we focus on a


1312
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,326
single hero asset?


1313
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,016
How much detail do we actually


1314
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:36,346
want?


1315
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:38,246
And, what graphical style best


1316
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:39,426
represents what we're trying to


1317
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:39,866
convey?


1318
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:42,546
Have we really paid attention to


1319
00:37:42,546 --> 00:37:43,956
Grant earlier and are thinking


1320
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:45,536
about the level of interaction


1321
00:37:45,536 --> 00:37:46,506
we want people to have with our


1322
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:47,116
experience?


1323
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:49,376
Having a clear answer to


1324
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:50,726
questions like these will help


1325
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:53,026
determine where best to put your


1326
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:54,256
rendering budget when you're


1327
00:37:54,256 --> 00:37:55,726
developing your app.


1328
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:58,876
For example, imagine you're


1329
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,036
building an AR experience


1330
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,676
similar to the IKEA Place app,


1331
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:02,996
where people can preview


1332
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:04,466
different pieces of furniture by


1333
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:06,366
being able to place them in


1334
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:08,056
their home, or in our case,


1335
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,056
outside on their patio.


1336
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:11,256
Now, the stars of the show are


1337
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,106
actually the different furniture


1338
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:14,776
pieces, so you need to present


1339
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:16,746
highly detailed objects that


1340
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:18,306
closely mirror the real world


1341
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:19,346
counterparts.


1342
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:22,346
In this case, it is a good idea


1343
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:23,976
to make sure that you spend a


1344
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:26,046
little extra time in your


1345
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:27,506
rendering budget on these single


1346
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,696
hero assets, because their level


1347
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:31,136
of quality can essentially make


1348
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:31,896
or break a sale.


1349
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:35,866
On the other hand, you decide


1350
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:36,776
that you've had enough of


1351
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:37,836
accidentally stepping on those


1352
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:40,766
little, tiny, plastic bricks of


1353
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:42,056
agonizing pain that your kids


1354
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:43,106
start laying around the house.


1355
00:38:43,106 --> 00:38:44,716
So, in order to preserve your


1356
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:45,766
sanity, you build an AR


1357
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:46,796
experience so they can play


1358
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:47,726
around with as many of these


1359
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:48,936
blocks as they can possibly


1360
00:38:48,936 --> 00:38:50,876
imagine, similar to Playgrounds


1361
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:51,116
AR.


1362
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:52,766
And, save yourself from ever


1363
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,116
having to experience brick pain


1364
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:54,406
again.


1365
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,596
In an app like this, where you


1366
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:57,466
potentially have a lot of


1367
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,446
objects being rendered and


1368
00:38:58,446 --> 00:39:00,806
interacted with, you want to


1369
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,566
basically create very simple,


1370
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:04,886
low-poly models with a flat


1371
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,316
colorful material, so that you


1372
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,666
can have a ton of them onscreen,


1373
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:09,106
and still have really good


1374
00:39:09,106 --> 00:39:09,696
performance.


1375
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:12,786
So, now that we've asked


1376
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:13,696
ourselves these important


1377
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:15,446
questions, it's time to set up


1378
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:16,366
our AR canvas.


1379
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:17,846
Just like painters like to set


1380
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:19,366
up their canvas in space before


1381
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:20,926
they begin work, we would like


1382
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:22,636
to have a couple suggestions of


1383
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:24,746
how to set up your project up


1384
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:25,856
front, in order to position


1385
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:27,566
yourself for optimal success.


1386
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:31,146
We are big fans of creating a


1387
00:39:31,146 --> 00:39:32,366
focus square to determine where


1388
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:33,226
to start placing your AR


1389
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:33,686
content.


1390
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:35,676
And, if you're using SceneKit,


1391
00:39:36,016 --> 00:39:36,876
right there on the bottom of the


1392
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:37,886
screen, you have the option to


1393
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:39,266
actually activate the statistics


1394
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:39,566
panel.


1395
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,446
This will allow you to see your


1396
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,616
current frames per second, as


1397
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:44,176
well as how many polygons there


1398
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:45,516
are visible on the screen at any


1399
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,746
given time.


1400
00:39:46,746 --> 00:39:47,656
Which should be very helpful as


1401
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:48,796
you start to build out your app


1402
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:49,866
and put all the different


1403
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:50,566
elements into it.


1404
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:53,576
So, now that we have a starter


1405
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:54,976
scene up and running, I was


1406
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,396
thinking, what will be a good


1407
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,686
example AR app to help get over


1408
00:39:58,686 --> 00:39:59,566
these best practices?


1409
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:01,876
So, I'm not really an outdoorsy


1410
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:03,876
guy, but coming to California, I


1411
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:05,336
find that here a lot of people


1412
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:05,506
are.


1413
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,086
So, I've been trying to connect


1414
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:07,646
with nature.


1415
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:09,776
You know, go camping, maybe make


1416
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:12,036
a campfire for once, and yet it


1417
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:13,196
really didn't happen.


1418
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:14,156
So, instead I thought, let's


1419
00:40:14,156 --> 00:40:15,196
just throw it into an app, and


1420
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:15,806
see how it goes.


1421
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:18,386
And we're going to call it


1422
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:19,016
CampfiAR.


1423
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,086
I know, it's perfect, right?


1424
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:24,956
Now, we can work on building out


1425
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:26,816
a detailed, single object, and


1426
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:28,126
bring all the joys of being


1427
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,456
outdoors without the fear of any


1428
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:31,376
of those bugs or fresh air.


1429
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:35,616
We decided to render with a


1430
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:37,396
stylized, semi-realistic, and


1431
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:38,506
playful graphical style.


1432
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,126
And, apply unique details to the


1433
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:42,726
use of careful application of


1434
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:44,336
some key, physically-based


1435
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:45,346
material properties.


1436
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:47,796
These choices mean that we could


1437
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:48,946
potentially use a lot of


1438
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,426
polygons to render the content


1439
00:40:50,426 --> 00:40:52,526
on the screen, but why deprive


1440
00:40:52,596 --> 00:40:53,986
people of the ability to spend


1441
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:55,296
multiple hours staring at our


1442
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,226
beautiful campfire?


1443
00:40:56,876 --> 00:40:57,916
Let's avoid going down that


1444
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,896
route, and work towards


1445
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:00,486
optimizing our scene by using a


1446
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:01,896
few tricks of the trade.


1447
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:05,636
So, we'll begin by focusing on


1448
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:07,156
the foundational structure of 3D


1449
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:08,556
objects, the mesh.


1450
00:41:09,086 --> 00:41:10,736
And describe the typical


1451
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,186
development flow that will allow


1452
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:13,736
you to create highly detailed


1453
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:15,636
models, but still maintain a low


1454
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:17,706
poly count for all the models in


1455
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:18,156
your scene.


1456
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:19,826
And, for those of you who might


1457
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:21,126
not know, poly count is


1458
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:22,336
essentially the number of


1459
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,086
polygons, typically triangles,


1460
00:41:24,296 --> 00:41:25,496
that a mesh is composed of.


1461
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,046
So, one of the first things we


1462
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:29,806
like to do, is lay out the basic


1463
00:41:29,806 --> 00:41:31,086
structure of an AR scene by


1464
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:32,636
using these simple meshes.


1465
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:34,676
We find using this type of


1466
00:41:34,676 --> 00:41:35,876
white-boxing technique to be


1467
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:37,456
really helpful for testing out


1468
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:38,936
some basic interactions, as well


1469
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:41,056
as seeing how well the objects


1470
00:41:41,156 --> 00:41:42,326
fit into the real world, what


1471
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:43,406
kind of scale are they at?


1472
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:45,796
You know, actually, I think this


1473
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:47,186
campfire looks really great.


1474
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:48,066
I think we're going to call it a


1475
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:48,716
day here.


1476
00:41:49,046 --> 00:41:50,066
Let's just call this done and


1477
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:50,456
ship it.


1478
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:51,316
Thanks everyone.


1479
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:53,106
I'm off to the afterparty, and


1480
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:54,256
-- wait.


1481
00:41:54,256 --> 00:41:55,826
So, that didn't look like a


1482
00:41:55,826 --> 00:41:56,566
campfire to you guys?


1483
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:58,486
Oh, alright.


1484
00:41:58,486 --> 00:41:59,226
Sorry. Really?


1485
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:02,276
My bad. Let's jump back to


1486
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,876
actually building out this


1487
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:04,626
campfire mesh.


1488
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:07,136
I want to give a quick high/low


1489
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:08,796
review of what a mesh is, and


1490
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,216
the basic data structures that


1491
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:10,786
comprise it.


1492
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:12,596
So, now you can think of a mesh


1493
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,226
as being a collection of


1494
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:15,886
triangles that are arranged in


1495
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:17,536
3D space that will form a


1496
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:19,156
surface for you to apply


1497
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:20,116
materials on.


1498
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,486
And, the corners of these


1499
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:24,306
triangles are actually made up


1500
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:25,686
of points called vertices, which


1501
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:26,846
hold different pieces of


1502
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,736
information, such as its


1503
00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:30,106
position in space, UV


1504
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,506
coordinates for texture


1505
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:33,116
application, as well as a very


1506
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:34,166
important property that we'll go


1507
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,956
over later called the normals.


1508
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:38,836
Well, since I got busted for


1509
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,356
trying to ship early, I wanted


1510
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:41,726
to redeem myself by building out


1511
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,356
one of the most gorgeous


1512
00:42:43,636 --> 00:42:45,016
campfires in the world.


1513
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:46,706
Take a look at the details of


1514
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:47,216
this camp.


1515
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:48,616
Look at that fish and those


1516
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:49,096
branches.


1517
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:51,126
You can see all the intricate


1518
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:52,996
details of the scales, as well


1519
00:42:52,996 --> 00:42:53,976
as the etchings found on the


1520
00:42:53,976 --> 00:42:54,266
bark.


1521
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:57,266
But, man, my performance has


1522
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:57,546
tanked.


1523
00:42:58,116 --> 00:42:59,716
And, that poly count has gone up


1524
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:01,016
to almost about a million


1525
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:02,086
polygons for this screen.


1526
00:43:02,906 --> 00:43:04,736
So, I'm already in hot water,


1527
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:06,466
and I don't want to get in any


1528
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:07,536
more trouble, so we better go


1529
00:43:07,536 --> 00:43:08,406
back and fix this.


1530
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:09,706
As I'm concerned about the


1531
00:43:09,706 --> 00:43:11,126
impact that this will have on


1532
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:12,846
battery life, as well as how


1533
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:14,226
people are able to perceive and


1534
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:15,616
interact with this AR scene.


1535
00:43:16,116 --> 00:43:17,196
So, let's see what we can do to,


1536
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:18,466
kind of, help reduce the number


1537
00:43:18,466 --> 00:43:19,246
of polygons here.


1538
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:22,656
Most 3D authoring tools have


1539
00:43:22,656 --> 00:43:24,146
specific functions that make it


1540
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:25,796
easy for you to reduce the


1541
00:43:25,796 --> 00:43:26,966
actual complexity of your


1542
00:43:26,966 --> 00:43:27,466
models.


1543
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:29,336
Here, we've reduced the number


1544
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:31,266
of polygons associated with the


1545
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:32,996
high-density model of the fish.


1546
00:43:33,956 --> 00:43:35,846
But, notice that, as we zoom in,


1547
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,846
many of the details have been


1548
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:37,326
lost.


1549
00:43:37,736 --> 00:43:38,616
But, don't fret.


1550
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,246
We can use certain material


1551
00:43:40,246 --> 00:43:41,406
properties later on that will


1552
00:43:41,406 --> 00:43:42,286
bring back a lot of those


1553
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,166
missing details.


1554
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,336
The key here is to build a solid


1555
00:43:46,336 --> 00:43:48,116
foundational mesh that uses a


1556
00:43:48,116 --> 00:43:49,766
minimal amount of polygons.


1557
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:51,086
So, let's put aside the


1558
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,166
high-density mesh for now.


1559
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,376
And, let's focus on building up


1560
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:54,686
this low-density mesh as we move


1561
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:55,056
forward.


1562
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:58,106
Alright, so I'll admit that this


1563
00:43:58,226 --> 00:43:59,736
isn't looking quite as good as


1564
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:01,316
before, but man, you can take a


1565
00:44:01,316 --> 00:44:02,206
look at that performance.


1566
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:03,876
Not only have you saved a crazy


1567
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:05,616
amount of overhead by reducing


1568
00:44:05,616 --> 00:44:06,816
the number of polygons found on


1569
00:44:06,816 --> 00:44:08,316
the screen, but we're able to


1570
00:44:08,316 --> 00:44:10,416
add a bunch of 3D objects to


1571
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:12,276
this scene to make it even more


1572
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:12,916
robust.


1573
00:44:13,716 --> 00:44:14,826
And, if you recall, in our


1574
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:16,346
previous high-density mesh, we


1575
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:17,866
were running at about 30 frames


1576
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:18,266
per second.


1577
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:19,536
But, now we're back to 60


1578
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:19,936
frames.


1579
00:44:20,586 --> 00:44:22,666
And, we were close to about, I


1580
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,086
think about a million polygons,


1581
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:26,216
and now it's down to 9,000.


1582
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:27,406
This is incredible.


1583
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:29,416
Because of this, we are well on


1584
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,896
our way to having those


1585
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:31,906
performance specification that


1586
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:32,426
we desire.


1587
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:34,776
A really solid frame rate with


1588
00:44:35,026 --> 00:44:36,546
minimal impact to the battery


1589
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:36,886
life.


1590
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:39,646
So, now that we have this


1591
00:44:39,646 --> 00:44:41,506
optimized model in our campfire


1592
00:44:41,506 --> 00:44:42,396
scene, let's see how we can


1593
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:44,026
bring back some of those details


1594
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:45,696
that we lost by working on what


1595
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:47,096
some of these different material


1596
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:49,086
properties and techniques that


1597
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,586
will ensure that our model looks


1598
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:52,306
as good as possible while still


1599
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:53,666
maintaining that great level of


1600
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:54,156
performance.


1601
00:44:54,156 --> 00:44:56,766
So, you may have heard this time


1602
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:57,786
before, physically-based


1603
00:44:57,786 --> 00:44:59,256
rendering thrown about regarding


1604
00:44:59,256 --> 00:45:00,246
modern 3D rendering.


1605
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,716
It's a pretty complex topic that


1606
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:03,916
will take a lot more time than


1607
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,486
we actually have in this session


1608
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:06,156
to go over.


1609
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:08,266
But, the basic concept describes


1610
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:09,856
the ability to take the


1611
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:11,356
application of your different


1612
00:45:11,356 --> 00:45:12,796
material properties onto your


1613
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,766
mesh, in order to have it react


1614
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:16,666
realistically to the simulated


1615
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,866
lights found in your AR scene.


1616
00:45:19,456 --> 00:45:20,546
And, moving forward, all the


1617
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:21,206
materials that we'll be


1618
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:22,696
discussing will conform to this


1619
00:45:22,696 --> 00:45:23,436
shading technique.


1620
00:45:24,586 --> 00:45:25,296
If you want further details


1621
00:45:25,296 --> 00:45:26,376
about this concept, there's a


1622
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:29,596
great WWDC 2016 talk that goes


1623
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:30,896
over details about


1624
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,036
physically-based rendering as it


1625
00:45:32,036 --> 00:45:33,186
applies to SceneKit, called


1626
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:34,736
Advances in SceneKit Rendering.


1627
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:37,276
Now, with that said, let's start


1628
00:45:37,356 --> 00:45:38,466
talking about our first material


1629
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:40,056
property, albedo, or what is


1630
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:41,296
sometimes lovingly referred to


1631
00:45:41,296 --> 00:45:42,836
as the base or diffuse color


1632
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:43,316
property.


1633
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,516
So, let's jump back into


1634
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:46,076
CampfiAR.


1635
00:45:47,016 --> 00:45:48,006
Previously our base measure's


1636
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:48,886
looking a little bit boring,


1637
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,066
with the gray material


1638
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:51,626
associated with it, but after


1639
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:52,956
you apply albedo, you start to


1640
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:54,356
see that it looks a lot better.


1641
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:55,756
But, the campfire is still


1642
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:56,996
missing a lot of those small,


1643
00:45:57,076 --> 00:45:58,436
finite details that were


1644
00:45:58,436 --> 00:45:59,456
originally found in that


1645
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,406
high-density mesh.


1646
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:02,096
As you move closer to the


1647
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:04,046
campfire, you'll notice that all


1648
00:46:04,046 --> 00:46:05,016
the surfaces are relatively


1649
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:05,366
flat.


1650
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:06,846
And, this is something that


1651
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:07,906
we'll definitely correct later,


1652
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:09,146
but first let's dive into the


1653
00:46:09,146 --> 00:46:10,186
albedo property a little bit


1654
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:10,446
more.


1655
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:13,966
Think of the albedo as basically


1656
00:46:13,966 --> 00:46:15,266
being the base mesh of the


1657
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:16,326
various objects in your AR


1658
00:46:16,326 --> 00:46:16,656
scene.


1659
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:18,496
This is the material property


1660
00:46:18,496 --> 00:46:20,246
that you typically use to apply


1661
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:22,076
textures to the surface of your


1662
00:46:22,076 --> 00:46:22,376
model.


1663
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:24,676
If you recall, your mesh


1664
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:25,846
contained different vertices,


1665
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:26,946
that held different pieces of


1666
00:46:26,946 --> 00:46:27,586
information.


1667
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:29,916
The ones you see here are


1668
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,286
actually called UV coordinates,


1669
00:46:31,336 --> 00:46:33,166
which help map out how pixels


1670
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,236
from various texture maps are


1671
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:35,576
actually applied to the model.


1672
00:46:36,606 --> 00:46:37,996
And, after we've worked with


1673
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,746
these textures, we've applied


1674
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:41,356
the abel material to this


1675
00:46:41,356 --> 00:46:42,576
property on the fish.


1676
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:45,286
So, now we've essentially


1677
00:46:45,286 --> 00:46:46,886
applied a texture to our fish, I


1678
00:46:46,886 --> 00:46:47,856
want to remind you about the


1679
00:46:47,856 --> 00:46:49,656
fact that you never know where


1680
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:50,206
people are never going to


1681
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:51,126
experience your app.


1682
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:52,896
You want to be able to have your


1683
00:46:52,986 --> 00:46:54,506
content fit in as many different


1684
00:46:54,506 --> 00:46:55,626
scenarios as possible.


1685
00:46:55,706 --> 00:46:57,606
So, you want to take care in


1686
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,206
selecting the right albedo value


1687
00:46:59,726 --> 00:47:01,056
that are neither too bright or


1688
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:01,416
dark.


1689
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:03,776
As, you want this to work in a


1690
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:04,746
wide variety of different


1691
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:05,456
situations.


1692
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:07,856
So, our fish has got a skin, but


1693
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:08,886
we're still missing a lot of


1694
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:10,286
details from this, and the other


1695
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,746
objects found in the scene.


1696
00:47:12,136 --> 00:47:13,626
So let's go back into how we can


1697
00:47:13,626 --> 00:47:14,636
start bringing back a lot of


1698
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:16,866
those details through the use of


1699
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:18,236
the normal material property.


1700
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:20,656
So, as we jump back into


1701
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:22,466
CampfiAR, let's see how we can


1702
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,916
bring back some of those details


1703
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,436
that we moved from optimization.


1704
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,476
This can be done through the use


1705
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:28,676
of a special texture called a


1706
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:30,706
normal map, which you can see


1707
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:32,056
here as the blue tinted maps


1708
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:33,476
that are now applied to our AR


1709
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:33,786
scene.


1710
00:47:34,576 --> 00:47:36,016
These maps allow you to add


1711
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:38,276
those fine surface details back


1712
00:47:38,276 --> 00:47:39,526
into your models, without the


1713
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:40,876
need to add any additional


1714
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:41,336
geometry.


1715
00:47:42,036 --> 00:47:43,276
Now, after applying the normal


1716
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:45,046
maps, you can see how the fish


1717
00:47:45,046 --> 00:47:46,676
exhibits some scales, as well as


1718
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:48,306
making the branches show just a


1719
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:49,256
tiny bit more detail.


1720
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:51,276
Also if you take a look at the


1721
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:52,296
statistics panel, you'll notice


1722
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:53,456
that there was absolutely no


1723
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:55,256
change in the number of polygons


1724
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:56,176
related to this model.


1725
00:47:56,336 --> 00:47:58,946
It's magical, isn't it?


1726
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:01,236
So, how do we make this normal


1727
00:48:01,236 --> 00:48:01,446
map?


1728
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,196
Let's see a closer look at one


1729
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:05,156
of the branches, and see what we


1730
00:48:05,156 --> 00:48:06,216
can do to make this work.


1731
00:48:06,626 --> 00:48:07,936
In most modern 3D modeling


1732
00:48:07,936 --> 00:48:09,346
applications, artists have the


1733
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:10,406
ability to generate these normal


1734
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:12,496
maps by projecting details from


1735
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:14,236
a high-density mesh over to a


1736
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:14,986
low-density one.


1737
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:16,556
So, here you can see what the


1738
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:17,936
normal map looks like on the


1739
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,176
branches after they've been


1740
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:20,636
generated from this high-density


1741
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:21,046
mesh.


1742
00:48:21,756 --> 00:48:23,296
And, after applying the normal


1743
00:48:23,296 --> 00:48:24,786
map, you start to notice all


1744
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:25,826
those nice details that were


1745
00:48:25,826 --> 00:48:27,276
originally lost come back into


1746
00:48:27,276 --> 00:48:27,756
this model.


1747
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:28,876
But we still are able to


1748
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,446
maintain that high performance,


1749
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:31,656
of the low-poly mesh.


1750
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:34,386
So, you may be wondering why the


1751
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,456
normal map looks kind of


1752
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:37,356
strange, well the colors of the


1753
00:48:37,356 --> 00:48:38,836
normal map actually represent


1754
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:40,626
visual representations of the


1755
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,236
vector data.


1756
00:48:41,236 --> 00:48:43,816
And, determine how the normals


1757
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:45,446
on the surface model will be


1758
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:47,866
offset in order to change the


1759
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:48,566
way that light is being


1760
00:48:48,566 --> 00:48:50,526
reflected, and our key to making


1761
00:48:50,526 --> 00:48:51,196
this effect work.


1762
00:48:51,706 --> 00:48:53,766
That was a bit of a mouthful, so


1763
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:54,936
let's dive a little bit more


1764
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:57,006
into this property, because


1765
00:48:57,276 --> 00:48:58,636
normals we feel are a really


1766
00:48:58,636 --> 00:48:59,326
important topic.


1767
00:48:59,946 --> 00:49:00,946
And, we want to spend a couple


1768
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:02,846
more minutes just going into how


1769
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:04,786
truly spectacular these can be.


1770
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:07,206
The art of manipulating normal


1771
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:08,626
vectors are one of the key tools


1772
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:10,396
that AR creators have in order


1773
00:49:10,396 --> 00:49:12,906
to add a lot of the significant


1774
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:14,416
details back into their model.


1775
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:16,706
So, what the heck is a normal


1776
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,206
vector, and are there strange


1777
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:19,016
vectors as well?


1778
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:20,916
Well, no there's no strange


1779
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,926
vectors unless you forgot your


1780
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:24,046
high school trig, but normal


1781
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:25,566
vectors lie perpendicular to the


1782
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:26,906
surface of the mesh, and are


1783
00:49:26,906 --> 00:49:28,146
associated with each mesh


1784
00:49:28,146 --> 00:49:28,766
vertex.


1785
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:30,266
So, why do we need these


1786
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:30,746
normals?


1787
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:33,406
Well, in order to see our


1788
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:34,666
object, you need to place


1789
00:49:34,716 --> 00:49:36,416
simulated lights into your 3D


1790
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:36,936
engine.


1791
00:49:37,796 --> 00:49:39,446
Normal vectors allow 3D engines


1792
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:40,826
to calculate how these lights


1793
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:41,906
are actually reflected off the


1794
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:43,126
surface of these materials.


1795
00:49:43,616 --> 00:49:45,026
Similar to how light behaves in


1796
00:49:45,026 --> 00:49:46,156
the real world, and are


1797
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:47,376
essential to making sure that


1798
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:49,286
your AR scenes mimic reality.


1799
00:49:49,846 --> 00:49:52,016
What's interesting is that by


1800
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:53,786
modifying these normals, you can


1801
00:49:53,786 --> 00:49:54,906
trick the engine to thinking


1802
00:49:54,906 --> 00:49:56,156
that your surface is actually


1803
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:57,756
more detailed than it really is,


1804
00:49:58,136 --> 00:49:59,276
without need to add any


1805
00:49:59,276 --> 00:49:59,946
additional geometry.


1806
00:50:00,046 --> 00:50:01,896
If you take a look at this


1807
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:03,246
example, you can see a simple


1808
00:50:03,246 --> 00:50:04,866
sphere, being rendered with flat


1809
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:05,236
shading.


1810
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:06,836
What this means, that the


1811
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:08,196
normals associated with each


1812
00:50:08,196 --> 00:50:09,776
face of the mesh are pointing in


1813
00:50:09,776 --> 00:50:11,556
the exact same direction, as


1814
00:50:11,556 --> 00:50:12,686
seen by the 2D diagram.


1815
00:50:13,586 --> 00:50:15,376
Now, when you -- when light


1816
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:16,676
reacts to this surface, you'll


1817
00:50:16,676 --> 00:50:18,366
be actually able to notice all


1818
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:19,936
the different polygons


1819
00:50:19,936 --> 00:50:21,246
comprising this mesh due to


1820
00:50:21,246 --> 00:50:22,856
being evenly lit across each


1821
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:23,286
face.


1822
00:50:23,776 --> 00:50:25,866
Here, though, we're using the


1823
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:27,496
exact same model, but leveraging


1824
00:50:27,496 --> 00:50:28,866
a technique called smooth or


1825
00:50:28,866 --> 00:50:29,716
phong shading.


1826
00:50:30,346 --> 00:50:31,756
Notice that the normals are


1827
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:33,186
actually gradually changing as


1828
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:34,356
you move across the surface of


1829
00:50:34,356 --> 00:50:34,996
the polygon.


1830
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:37,736
With the engine calculates the


1831
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:40,076
reflection off of this model,


1832
00:50:40,076 --> 00:50:41,096
it'll give the impression of a


1833
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:43,016
smooth, curved surface due to


1834
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:44,636
the gradual interpolation of


1835
00:50:44,636 --> 00:50:45,296
these normals.


1836
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,206
What's really awesome is that


1837
00:50:48,206 --> 00:50:49,486
these two models have the exact


1838
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:50,366
same number of polygons


1839
00:50:50,366 --> 00:50:51,146
associated with them.


1840
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:52,186
But, through this normal


1841
00:50:52,186 --> 00:50:54,016
manipulation, the object will


1842
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:54,946
seem to have a much more


1843
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:56,626
smoother and detailed surface,


1844
00:50:56,976 --> 00:50:58,466
without the need to, again, add


1845
00:50:58,466 --> 00:50:59,756
or change any of the geometry


1846
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,036
associated with this mesh.


1847
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:03,966
Whew. Alright, so we've gone


1848
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:05,356
through enough about normals.


1849
00:51:05,356 --> 00:51:06,776
Let's, kind of, go over what it


1850
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:07,846
takes to add a little bit more


1851
00:51:07,846 --> 00:51:09,426
shiny to your scene.


1852
00:51:10,216 --> 00:51:12,066
CampfiAR is definitely starting


1853
00:51:12,066 --> 00:51:12,526
to look better.


1854
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:14,756
But, some of these normal maps


1855
00:51:14,756 --> 00:51:15,706
[inaudible] but some of these


1856
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:16,886
parts seem a bit dull,


1857
00:51:17,406 --> 00:51:18,416
especially the objects that you


1858
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:19,786
expect to be shiny or


1859
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:20,806
reflective, kind of like the


1860
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:21,916
kettle or the fish in this


1861
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:22,136
scene.


1862
00:51:23,286 --> 00:51:24,576
What we see here is the results


1863
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:26,356
of applying a metal map to our


1864
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:26,886
AR scene.


1865
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:29,766
A metal map is used to determine


1866
00:51:29,766 --> 00:51:31,146
which object surfaces should


1867
00:51:31,146 --> 00:51:33,016
exhibit reflective properties.


1868
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:34,966
Once the material property's


1869
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,756
activated, notice how shiny and


1870
00:51:36,756 --> 00:51:38,326
reflective the area's we've


1871
00:51:38,326 --> 00:51:39,306
designated as being metallic


1872
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:39,626
are.


1873
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,256
And, on the kettle as well as


1874
00:51:41,406 --> 00:51:42,476
the scales of the fish.


1875
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:45,956
So, let's focus specifically on


1876
00:51:45,956 --> 00:51:46,276
the kettle.


1877
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:48,056
We'll begin by taking the


1878
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:49,796
original albedo map, and then


1879
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:51,166
apply a metal map to the


1880
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,446
metalness property of this


1881
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:52,836
material.


1882
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:55,106
After the application of the


1883
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:56,706
metal map, the 3D render will


1884
00:51:56,706 --> 00:51:58,006
actually designate the surface


1885
00:51:58,006 --> 00:52:00,466
to be reflective in the areas on


1886
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:01,446
the map that were actually


1887
00:52:01,446 --> 00:52:01,626
white.


1888
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:03,316
And, despite begin called


1889
00:52:03,316 --> 00:52:04,326
metalness, it doesn't


1890
00:52:04,326 --> 00:52:05,336
necessarily mean that your


1891
00:52:05,336 --> 00:52:06,886
object needs to contain metal.


1892
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:08,336
Rather, we're just letting the


1893
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,296
3D engine know that this object


1894
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:11,416
should exhibit, kind of, a


1895
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:12,906
reflective surface.


1896
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:16,016
Now, it's best to use the


1897
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:17,176
metalness map on your model,


1898
00:52:17,526 --> 00:52:19,336
like our kettle here, when it


1899
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,266
has both a mixture of metallic


1900
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,466
and non-metallic surfaces.


1901
00:52:23,066 --> 00:52:24,276
It's a simple grayscale map,


1902
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:25,676
where the level of metalness


1903
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,646
ranges from being black, for


1904
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:29,006
non-metal surfaces, to white,


1905
00:52:29,006 --> 00:52:30,166
for metallic surfaces.


1906
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:32,256
And, it allows for a single


1907
00:52:32,256 --> 00:52:34,836
material to be used to represent


1908
00:52:34,836 --> 00:52:35,906
both reflective and


1909
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:37,466
non-reflective surfaces on your


1910
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:38,126
single object.


1911
00:52:38,926 --> 00:52:41,216
However, this kettle's a bit


1912
00:52:41,276 --> 00:52:42,066
crazy reflective.


1913
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:43,966
And, doesn't really quite


1914
00:52:44,016 --> 00:52:44,966
provide the look that we're


1915
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:45,466
hoping for.


1916
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:47,636
So, in this case, we want to


1917
00:52:47,636 --> 00:52:49,146
potentially vary the amount of


1918
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:50,456
reflectivity, as well as


1919
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:51,906
simulate the fact that all


1920
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,576
surfaces are not perfectly


1921
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:54,006
smooth.


1922
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,526
And, they actually might exhibit


1923
00:52:55,816 --> 00:52:58,056
slight small, microabrasions to


1924
00:52:58,056 --> 00:52:58,696
their surface.


1925
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,466
And, this is where the roughness


1926
00:53:01,466 --> 00:53:02,446
material property comes into


1927
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:02,736
play.


1928
00:53:04,066 --> 00:53:05,516
So, returning back to CampfiAR,


1929
00:53:06,066 --> 00:53:07,246
you can see how the reflective


1930
00:53:07,246 --> 00:53:08,776
surfaces are a bit too smooth.


1931
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:10,986
As we layer on the roughness


1932
00:53:10,986 --> 00:53:12,316
maps, you can see that we are


1933
00:53:12,316 --> 00:53:13,746
going to modify both the kettle


1934
00:53:13,746 --> 00:53:15,226
and the fish to adjust the way


1935
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:16,026
that they're reflecting.


1936
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,816
And then, after we apply the


1937
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:19,316
roughness material property to


1938
00:53:19,316 --> 00:53:21,116
both of these objects, you can


1939
00:53:21,146 --> 00:53:22,306
clearly see the reduction of the


1940
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:22,926
reflectivity.


1941
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:25,066
This combination of roughness


1942
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:26,516
and metalness properties are


1943
00:53:26,516 --> 00:53:28,486
another important concept to


1944
00:53:28,486 --> 00:53:28,996
focus on.


1945
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:30,356
So, let's dive a little bit


1946
00:53:30,356 --> 00:53:31,396
deeper into the roughness


1947
00:53:31,436 --> 00:53:34,086
material property.


1948
00:53:34,186 --> 00:53:36,076
Use roughness to simulate micro


1949
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:38,216
surface details, which in turn


1950
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,686
will affect the way light is


1951
00:53:39,736 --> 00:53:41,216
being bounced off that surface.


1952
00:53:41,846 --> 00:53:43,086
If the roughness property is set


1953
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:45,236
to completely smooth, then light


1954
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:46,796
will bounce off of your surface


1955
00:53:46,796 --> 00:53:47,266
like a mirror.


1956
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:49,196
As you increase the roughness of


1957
00:53:49,196 --> 00:53:50,666
the material, light reflects


1958
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,006
over a wider range of angles.


1959
00:53:52,336 --> 00:53:54,016
Here, we're slowly scaling a


1960
00:53:54,016 --> 00:53:55,816
constant roughness value between


1961
00:53:56,086 --> 00:53:57,956
no roughness to max roughness on


1962
00:53:57,956 --> 00:53:58,786
the kettle itself.


1963
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:02,326
And, this is a good way of being


1964
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,486
able to simulate the concept of


1965
00:54:04,486 --> 00:54:06,456
having microsurfaces, and


1966
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:07,606
blurring reflection to the point


1967
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:09,396
where you might not see any


1968
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:10,706
reflectivity depending on which


1969
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,106
range you put your value to.


1970
00:54:13,576 --> 00:54:16,536
So, for the kettle, we've taken


1971
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:17,746
the original metal surface, and


1972
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:19,416
instead of just applying a


1973
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:21,476
constant roughness value to it,


1974
00:54:21,876 --> 00:54:23,006
we actually applied a roughness


1975
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:23,176
map.


1976
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:25,436
And, this will help designate


1977
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:27,146
the surfaces where we will be


1978
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:29,656
scattering the light more often,


1979
00:54:29,656 --> 00:54:30,786
and more than others.


1980
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,956
Once we've applied the roughness


1981
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:34,926
map, we get to see the real


1982
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:36,346
final look of the reflectiveness


1983
00:54:36,346 --> 00:54:37,346
of this kettle, which is a lot


1984
00:54:37,346 --> 00:54:38,906
less shiny as before.


1985
00:54:40,106 --> 00:54:42,406
Now, a combination of this


1986
00:54:42,486 --> 00:54:43,826
metalness property and this


1987
00:54:43,826 --> 00:54:45,586
roughness property really make


1988
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:46,976
your reflective AR models look


1989
00:54:46,976 --> 00:54:47,566
phenomenal.


1990
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:49,656
Roughness can be used to tweak


1991
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:50,926
how much of your objects will


1992
00:54:50,926 --> 00:54:51,756
reflect the environment.


1993
00:54:52,046 --> 00:54:53,586
And, can really be used to add a


1994
00:54:53,586 --> 00:54:54,636
lot more realism to your


1995
00:54:54,636 --> 00:54:55,626
metallic surfaces.


1996
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:57,706
You can use this roughness map


1997
00:54:57,826 --> 00:55:00,076
to add additional minor details


1998
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:01,436
as we've done here, to make our


1999
00:55:01,436 --> 00:55:02,366
kettle look a little more


2000
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:02,946
scuffed up.


2001
00:55:04,066 --> 00:55:05,726
Now, to close out materials, we


2002
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:06,316
have two more material


2003
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:07,356
properties that I want to


2004
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:09,256
discuss to further refine your


2005
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:11,546
models, and have a good balance


2006
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:12,646
between performance and


2007
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:13,276
aesthetics.


2008
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:16,416
Ambient occlusion is a material


2009
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,686
property that is used to provide


2010
00:55:17,686 --> 00:55:20,216
your model with self-shadowing,


2011
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,476
which in turn can lead to adding


2012
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:23,016
additional depth and details to


2013
00:55:23,016 --> 00:55:23,856
your AR models.


2014
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:27,026
Now, while normal maps are great


2015
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:28,296
for applying significant amount


2016
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:30,486
of details back into your AR


2017
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:32,296
model, you can use ambient


2018
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:33,946
occlusion to really hammer in


2019
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:34,796
those details.


2020
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:36,386
Here, we're visualizing the


2021
00:55:36,386 --> 00:55:37,496
ambient occlusion maps for


2022
00:55:37,646 --> 00:55:39,786
CampfiAR, and it's a bit of a


2023
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:41,036
difficult effect to demonstrate,


2024
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:42,246
as it's meant to be relatively


2025
00:55:42,246 --> 00:55:42,616
subtle.


2026
00:55:42,616 --> 00:55:44,226
But, see if you can notice the


2027
00:55:44,226 --> 00:55:45,806
additional shadows on the logs,


2028
00:55:45,896 --> 00:55:47,086
as well as certain areas near


2029
00:55:47,086 --> 00:55:48,006
the bottom of the kettle.


2030
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:50,336
In our case here, it's kind of


2031
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:51,456
like playing Where's Waldo?


2032
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:53,356
with shadows, so let's focus in


2033
00:55:53,356 --> 00:55:56,876
on the logs in the scene.


2034
00:55:57,086 --> 00:55:58,726
So, here we're showing you the


2035
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:00,686
normal maped logs before.


2036
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:02,436
Now, there's some great details


2037
00:56:02,436 --> 00:56:03,756
found in the ridges, but we can


2038
00:56:03,756 --> 00:56:04,746
definitely improve some of these


2039
00:56:04,746 --> 00:56:05,256
areas.


2040
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:07,436
Now, as we look at the ambient


2041
00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:08,626
occlusion map, you can see how


2042
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:10,366
we've added some regions of


2043
00:56:10,696 --> 00:56:11,386
self-shadowing.


2044
00:56:11,386 --> 00:56:12,956
So, lower portions of the log,


2045
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,176
as well as around the small


2046
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:15,026
embedded stumps.


2047
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:17,746
And, after we apply the map to


2048
00:56:17,746 --> 00:56:19,196
our ambient occlusion property,


2049
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:20,746
I hope you can see the benefits


2050
00:56:20,746 --> 00:56:22,286
of adding those baked detail


2051
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:24,036
shadows without the need of


2052
00:56:24,036 --> 00:56:25,516
using expensive dynamic lights


2053
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:26,066
in your scene.


2054
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:30,266
When working in AR, we recommend


2055
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:31,426
that you actually bake your


2056
00:56:31,426 --> 00:56:32,766
ambient occlusion into a map.


2057
00:56:33,316 --> 00:56:34,086
Which is what we've done for


2058
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:34,456
CampfiAR.


2059
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:36,426
Rather than use the alternative,


2060
00:56:37,086 --> 00:56:39,056
such as screen space ambient


2061
00:56:39,326 --> 00:56:40,306
occlusions, which is a


2062
00:56:40,306 --> 00:56:41,886
camera-based post-process


2063
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:43,286
effect, and can potentially lead


2064
00:56:43,286 --> 00:56:45,256
to poor rendering performance in


2065
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:47,076
your scene.


2066
00:56:47,176 --> 00:56:48,336
And, last but certainly not


2067
00:56:48,336 --> 00:56:50,686
least, be frugal with the use of


2068
00:56:50,686 --> 00:56:51,526
your transparency in your


2069
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:52,346
materials materials.


2070
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:53,926
If you must use transparencies,


2071
00:56:54,126 --> 00:56:54,956
we recommend that you use


2072
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:56,336
separate materials for objects


2073
00:56:56,336 --> 00:56:57,506
where you see a combination of


2074
00:56:57,716 --> 00:56:59,066
transparent and non-transparent


2075
00:56:59,066 --> 00:56:59,696
surfaces.


2076
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:02,356
In general, when working with AR


2077
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:04,256
content, the use of a lot of


2078
00:57:04,256 --> 00:57:05,216
transparent surfaces can


2079
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:07,376
potentially have a huge impact


2080
00:57:07,376 --> 00:57:09,106
on performance, especially if


2081
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:10,206
you are having transparent


2082
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:11,036
surfaces that are, kind of,


2083
00:57:11,036 --> 00:57:12,526
stacked in front of each other


2084
00:57:12,606 --> 00:57:13,286
when you're viewing them.


2085
00:57:13,716 --> 00:57:14,726
This is known as overdraw, and


2086
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:15,196
it's something that you


2087
00:57:15,196 --> 00:57:16,526
definitely want to avoid when


2088
00:57:16,526 --> 00:57:17,306
you're working in AR.


2089
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:19,256
Whew. Alright.


2090
00:57:19,476 --> 00:57:20,826
I hope everybody's still with


2091
00:57:20,826 --> 00:57:21,996
me, as that was quite a lot to


2092
00:57:21,996 --> 00:57:22,486
go through.


2093
00:57:23,036 --> 00:57:24,646
So far, we've focused mostly on


2094
00:57:25,126 --> 00:57:27,156
how the AR content will react to


2095
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:28,786
the simulated spotlights found


2096
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:29,826
in our 3D engines.


2097
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:31,276
But now, it's time to focus on


2098
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:32,576
some ways to make our content


2099
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:33,966
seem like it's actually part of


2100
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:34,506
the real world.


2101
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:37,696
A fantastic option to use to


2102
00:57:37,696 --> 00:57:38,846
compensate for varied lighting


2103
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:40,226
conditions is to leverage one of


2104
00:57:40,306 --> 00:57:44,636
ARKit's well known features, and


2105
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:45,326
light estimation.


2106
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:47,116
Let's begin by activating this


2107
00:57:47,116 --> 00:57:48,126
functionality and see how it


2108
00:57:48,126 --> 00:57:48,736
affects our kettle.


2109
00:57:49,156 --> 00:57:50,286
Notice that how when the ambient


2110
00:57:50,286 --> 00:57:51,406
light changes in intensity in


2111
00:57:51,406 --> 00:57:52,906
the real world, a similar


2112
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:53,766
adjustment is made to the


2113
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:55,316
ambient light in our AR scene.


2114
00:57:56,436 --> 00:57:57,676
The way this works is that ARKit


2115
00:57:57,676 --> 00:57:59,256
analyzes each frame of the


2116
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:01,286
video, and uses them to estimate


2117
00:58:01,286 --> 00:58:02,306
the lighting condition of the


2118
00:58:02,306 --> 00:58:02,936
real world.


2119
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:05,076
It is an absolutely magical


2120
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:06,756
feature that helps assure that


2121
00:58:06,756 --> 00:58:08,136
the amount to light applied to


2122
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,776
your AR content matches what you


2123
00:58:09,776 --> 00:58:10,546
see in the real world.


2124
00:58:10,546 --> 00:58:13,536
Now, that we have magical light


2125
00:58:13,536 --> 00:58:15,026
wizards living in our AR scene,


2126
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:16,086
let's discuss shadows.


2127
00:58:16,796 --> 00:58:18,756
Shadows in AR are really, really


2128
00:58:18,756 --> 00:58:19,416
hard to get right.


2129
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,176
Your shadow needs to be able to


2130
00:58:21,176 --> 00:58:22,506
work in a wide variety of


2131
00:58:22,506 --> 00:58:23,206
situations.


2132
00:58:23,386 --> 00:58:25,096
Remember that people can be


2133
00:58:25,096 --> 00:58:26,206
potentially using your app


2134
00:58:26,356 --> 00:58:26,776
anywhere.


2135
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:28,516
And, if your AR shadows differ


2136
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:29,766
from the ones that are seen in


2137
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:30,796
the real world environment, it


2138
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:31,976
can be relatively jarring for


2139
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:32,676
your experience.


2140
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:35,136
Here, we have tried to


2141
00:58:35,226 --> 00:58:36,936
incorrectly cast a dynamic


2142
00:58:36,936 --> 00:58:39,396
shadow by using a directional


2143
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:40,996
light as a sharp angle in our 3D


2144
00:58:40,996 --> 00:58:41,286
engine.


2145
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:43,686
Shadows are a great way to make


2146
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,866
objects actually feel grounded


2147
00:58:44,866 --> 00:58:45,716
in the real world, but in this


2148
00:58:45,716 --> 00:58:47,066
case, it doesn't really match


2149
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:48,256
the shadows being seen in the


2150
00:58:48,256 --> 00:58:49,156
surrounding environment.


2151
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:50,716
It's like we're purposely trying


2152
00:58:50,716 --> 00:58:52,046
to defy the laws of physics


2153
00:58:53,816 --> 00:58:53,926
here.


2154
00:58:54,136 --> 00:58:55,316
Instead, we suggest that you


2155
00:58:55,316 --> 00:58:56,326
place your directional light


2156
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:58,076
directly overhead, and play a


2157
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:58,846
little bit around with the


2158
00:58:58,846 --> 00:59:00,526
intensity of that effect to make


2159
00:59:00,526 --> 00:59:02,536
sure that it actually feels a


2160
00:59:02,536 --> 00:59:03,476
little bit more subtle.


2161
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:05,136
This will allow your shadows to


2162
00:59:05,136 --> 00:59:06,216
work in a lot more different


2163
00:59:06,216 --> 00:59:08,016
situations, and a lot more


2164
00:59:08,016 --> 00:59:08,786
different scenarios.


2165
00:59:09,606 --> 00:59:10,926
An alternative to this is


2166
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:12,076
actually using a method where


2167
00:59:12,076 --> 00:59:13,186
you can create your own drop


2168
00:59:13,186 --> 00:59:14,356
shadow, rather than using


2169
00:59:14,356 --> 00:59:15,576
dynamic lights in your scene,


2170
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:17,556
which can get expensive, and can


2171
00:59:17,556 --> 00:59:19,446
severely affect performance if


2172
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:20,516
you're rendering a lot of 3D


2173
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:20,966
content.


2174
00:59:21,736 --> 00:59:23,956
Take the time to craft those


2175
00:59:24,296 --> 00:59:25,256
really good shadows.


2176
00:59:25,256 --> 00:59:26,746
And ensure that they will fit in


2177
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:28,736
as many real world situations as


2178
00:59:28,796 --> 00:59:29,166
possible.


2179
00:59:29,746 --> 00:59:32,306
Ah, environment maps.


2180
00:59:33,086 --> 00:59:34,486
If you really want to astound


2181
00:59:34,486 --> 00:59:35,866
people, you definitely want to


2182
00:59:35,866 --> 00:59:37,326
use these maps, especially on


2183
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:39,166
those AR objects that exhibit


2184
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:39,886
reflectivity.


2185
00:59:40,796 --> 00:59:41,946
It'll make it seem like your AR


2186
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,746
content exists right here, in


2187
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:44,366
the real world.


2188
00:59:44,836 --> 00:59:46,336
And, to make it super easy to


2189
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:48,086
leverage their powers we want to


2190
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:49,606
show you how one of the new


2191
00:59:49,606 --> 00:59:52,176
features in iOS 12 and ARKit


2192
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:54,006
2.0, automatic environmental


2193
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:55,586
mapping, can help you achieve


2194
00:59:55,586 --> 00:59:56,026
this effect.


2195
00:59:57,576 --> 00:59:58,826
If you take a close look at the


2196
00:59:58,826 --> 01:00:00,306
kettle, originally we're using a


2197
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:01,726
baked environment map that has a


2198
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:02,976
kind of blush tinge to it.


2199
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:05,246
Once we've activated the


2200
01:00:05,246 --> 01:00:06,836
automatic environmental mapping,


2201
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:07,996
notice how the kettle now


2202
01:00:07,996 --> 01:00:09,216
reflects a lot of the ground,


2203
01:00:09,286 --> 01:00:10,706
and the surrounding color of the


2204
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:11,786
current environment that we're


2205
01:00:11,786 --> 01:00:11,986
in.


2206
01:00:12,616 --> 01:00:13,856
You can even see a little bit of


2207
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:15,656
the green from the grass that


2208
01:00:15,656 --> 01:00:16,496
this kettle's sitting in.


2209
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,896
This is a fantastic feature


2210
01:00:19,176 --> 01:00:20,486
that'll really help ground your


2211
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:22,266
objects into the real world, and


2212
01:00:22,266 --> 01:00:23,616
with careful use of roughness,


2213
01:00:24,156 --> 01:00:25,126
can really enhance the


2214
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:26,736
believability of your scene.


2215
01:00:28,536 --> 01:00:30,346
So, now why is automatic


2216
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:31,846
environmental mapping so


2217
01:00:31,846 --> 01:00:32,976
actually incredible?


2218
01:00:33,436 --> 01:00:35,516
Typically, these maps are used


2219
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:37,036
to simulate the ability of


2220
01:00:37,076 --> 01:00:39,116
metallic surfaces to mirror the


2221
01:00:39,116 --> 01:00:40,056
environment around them.


2222
01:00:41,106 --> 01:00:43,156
You can see example of a cube


2223
01:00:43,156 --> 01:00:44,006
environment map here.


2224
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,426
Now, before ARKit added


2225
01:00:46,426 --> 01:00:47,846
automatic environmental mapping,


2226
01:00:47,946 --> 01:00:48,886
you had to provide your own


2227
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:50,086
image, and hope that it was


2228
01:00:50,086 --> 01:00:51,146
generic enough to work in a


2229
01:00:51,146 --> 01:00:52,936
large variety of situations that


2230
01:00:52,936 --> 01:00:54,046
your app may be used in.


2231
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:56,986
But now, with ARKit 2.0, you can


2232
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,006
kiss those sleepless night,


2233
01:00:58,006 --> 01:00:59,176
fretting about whether your


2234
01:00:59,176 --> 01:01:00,356
environment map is actually


2235
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,516
ruining your AR experience.


2236
01:01:02,786 --> 01:01:04,116
For more information about


2237
01:01:04,116 --> 01:01:05,316
environmental mapping, and other


2238
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:07,236
new features found in ARKit 2.0,


2239
01:01:07,556 --> 01:01:08,426
please check out the talk by


2240
01:01:08,426 --> 01:01:09,616
Arsalan and Reinhard called


2241
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:10,886
What's New in ARKit 2.


2242
01:01:11,446 --> 01:01:13,986
And now, to close out CampfiAR,


2243
01:01:14,286 --> 01:01:15,956
let's put all this together, and


2244
01:01:15,956 --> 01:01:17,526
add the final touches to the


2245
01:01:17,526 --> 01:01:18,056
campfire.


2246
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:21,006
With a little bit of animations


2247
01:01:21,006 --> 01:01:21,996
and [inaudible] effects, along


2248
01:01:21,996 --> 01:01:23,336
with the applications of all the


2249
01:01:23,336 --> 01:01:24,636
techniques discussed today,


2250
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:26,966
CampfiAR is ready for primetime.


2251
01:01:27,676 --> 01:01:29,076
Now, if I ever get the crazy


2252
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:30,576
urge to go outside, I can


2253
01:01:30,576 --> 01:01:32,526
suppress those urges, and stay


2254
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:34,556
safely at my desk, enjoying the


2255
01:01:34,596 --> 01:01:36,636
joys of simulated outdoors with


2256
01:01:36,636 --> 01:01:37,276
CAmpfiAR.


2257
01:01:38,046 --> 01:01:39,086
Who needs EpiPens?


2258
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:41,946
Not this guy.


2259
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,566
We went through lot of different


2260
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:44,306
topics today.


2261
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:45,896
So, I quickly want to reiterate


2262
01:01:45,896 --> 01:01:46,786
some of the important things to


2263
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,156
keep in mind while you're


2264
01:01:48,156 --> 01:01:48,866
developing your app.


2265
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:51,796
Remember that your app can be


2266
01:01:51,796 --> 01:01:52,926
used in a wide variety of real


2267
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:54,426
world conditions, so always make


2268
01:01:54,426 --> 01:01:55,766
sure aesthetic choices allow


2269
01:01:55,766 --> 01:01:57,196
your content to blend almost


2270
01:01:57,196 --> 01:01:57,616
anywhere.


2271
01:01:58,656 --> 01:02:00,066
Once you've decided what kind of


2272
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,676
AR experience you wish to build,


2273
01:02:01,946 --> 01:02:04,166
adhere to what you think your


2274
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:05,626
rendering budget is, and work as


2275
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:07,116
many optimizations as you can to


2276
01:02:07,116 --> 01:02:08,586
get that smooth performance and


2277
01:02:08,586 --> 01:02:09,596
efficiently use your power.


2278
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,076
And, finally leverage the use of


2279
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:13,626
various material properties, as


2280
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:15,046
well as the built-in features of


2281
01:02:15,046 --> 01:02:17,016
ARKit to get your AR content


2282
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:18,626
looking great, in order to


2283
01:02:18,626 --> 01:02:20,446
delight people who use your app.


2284
01:02:21,206 --> 01:02:22,836
And, for your reference, here's


2285
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:23,866
a table of all the material


2286
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:25,486
properties we worked with today


2287
01:02:25,486 --> 01:02:26,596
to build out CampfiAR.


2288
01:02:26,596 --> 01:02:28,616
