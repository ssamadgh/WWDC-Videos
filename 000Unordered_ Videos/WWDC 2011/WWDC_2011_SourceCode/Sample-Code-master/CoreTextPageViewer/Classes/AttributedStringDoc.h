/*
    File: AttributedStringDoc.h
Abstract: Manages the construction of AttributedStrings from xml/plist documents. These documents are generated on Mac OS X using the AttributedStringDoc Gen sibling project to this demo. It takes an RTF document created using TextEdit, reads it into an AttributedString, and finally proceeds to serialize it into a format (xml/plist) that is readable by the AttributedStringDoc class. In fact, the AttributedStringDoc class is also used on the desktop to serialize the file.
 
 This class also keeps track of the characteristics of the document: background colors, frames for each page, page number display, and number of columns to display.
 
 Note that this file is used in samples for iOS and Mac OS X and has platform-dependent code.
 
 Version: 1.0
