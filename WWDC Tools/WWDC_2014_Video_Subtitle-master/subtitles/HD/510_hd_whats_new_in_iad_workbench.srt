1
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:14,716
>> Good morning.


2
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,846
And welcome to WWDC
session on iAd Workbench.


3
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,726
I'm Paresh Rajwat and I'm
here with my colleague,


4
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,616
Ravi Chittari, to share with
you how we're evolving the iAd


5
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:27,626
Workbench platform.


6
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:31,576
We have some awesome stuff we
are bringing to you this fall,


7
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:33,656
and I can't wait to
share it with you.


8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,996
But before we go there, knowing
some of you are probably new


9
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,406
to advertising, and perhaps
hearing the word iAd Workbench


10
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:42,236
for the first time.


11
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,426
Let's start with two
foundational questions.


12
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,576
Why advertise?


13
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:49,956
And why iAd?


14
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:54,136
Let's start with the first
question: why advertise.


15
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:59,806
Say you developed this app, you
put a lot of time and energy


16
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:04,426
in it and you put
it on the App Store.


17
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:05,966
Now two things can happen.


18
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:11,526
First, users can find
your app, or second,


19
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:14,506
you can find users for your app.


20
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:18,276
Users will find your app
if they know about you,


21
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:21,336
or your app is featured in one


22
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:24,726
of the categories
in the App Store.


23
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:27,076
But with thousands
of apps coming


24
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:30,586
on the App Store every
day, natural discovery


25
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:33,206
of your app becomes
increasingly difficult


26
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,986
and you don't have
much control on it.


27
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,136
So what can you do
to take more control


28
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:43,436
of the success of your app?


29
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,776
You can advertise.


30
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:49,036
When you advertise, you
can find the right users


31
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:50,716
that will make the difference.


32
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:56,116
And when it comes to advertising
your apps or your products


33
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,786
to millions of Apple
costumers around the world,


34
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,376
iAd is your best choice.


35
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:11,316
Why? Because iAd is part of
Apple, and we know Apple users,


36
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:14,036
all 800 million of them.


37
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:18,886
We know what apps and other
items content they downloaded


38
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,236
and we know how and
when they use it.


39
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,966
Last June, we introduced
iAd Workbench.


40
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:31,066
It's self-service mobile
advertising platform


41
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:36,186
that provides you the simplest
way to promote your product


42
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:38,846
to millions of Apple
users around the world.


43
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:42,496
Since we introduced
iAd Workbench,


44
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:44,906
we have successfully
helped developers,


45
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:50,056
many of them advertising for the
very first time, drive millions


46
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:52,706
of visits to their
iTunes product pages.


47
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:56,906
iAd Workbench is
open to everyone.


48
00:02:57,986 --> 00:03:01,506
And you can promote
anything using iAd Workbench.


49
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,796
You can promote your apps.


50
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:08,436
You can promote your products,
your brands, your service,


51
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:11,256
including your iTunes content,


52
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:14,656
whether it's music,
books or movies.


53
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:19,756
Last June when we
introduced iAd Workbench,


54
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:22,266
we started in the U.S.
as the first market.


55
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,896
And then a few months
after that,


56
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,886
we expanded internationally.


57
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:31,136
iAd Workbench is now
available in 14 countries


58
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,116
and expanding rapidly.


59
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:37,986
Now creating a campaign using
iAd Workbench is very easy.


60
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,536
You can create one in
just a few minutes.


61
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:48,036
To demonstrate, why don't I have
Ravi show you how easy it is


62
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,446
to advertise using
iAd Workbench.


63
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,256
>> Thank you, Paresh.


64
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:53,256
Good morning everyone.


65
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,206
I'm Ravi Chittari from
iAd Engineering team.


66
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,566
I'm here to demo iAd Workbench.


67
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:06,256
In this demo, you will see how
easy it is to promote an app.


68
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:10,656
During this demo, you will see
several options, but I'm going


69
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,196
to focus on a few and
will cover more later.


70
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,786
Let's get started.


71
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:21,666
iAd Workbench is accessible
through iadworkbench.apple.com.


72
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,846
All you need is an
Apple ID to log in.


73
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:30,026
When you log in, the first page
you go to is the Dashboard.


74
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:32,926
Dashboard is a summary
of all the campaigns,


75
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:35,266
and also it gives basic metrics.


76
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,156
To get into the campaign
creation flow,


77
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:39,916
let's click on Create Campaign.


78
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:47,486
The first choice you have is
what do you want to promote?


79
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,316
App or a Product?


80
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:55,096
Let's select App.


81
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:59,256
Below are the three apps that
are published to the App Store


82
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,846
from my developer account.


83
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:05,416
iAd Workbench automatically gets
all the apps that you published


84
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,786
to the App Store and
makes it available here


85
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,666
so you can promote
through campaigns.


86
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,716
Let me select Klara.


87
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:19,896
For a bid type, my goal
is to drive downloads.


88
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,786
I'm going to select
CPC, cost per click.


89
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:26,506
Let me name my campaign.


90
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:37,966
Clicking on Next will take
me to step 2, Targeting.


91
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:40,936
Targeting is all about
finding the right audience


92
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:41,546
for your campaign.


93
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,746
We have two options,
Auto and Manual.


94
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:49,166
In case of Auto, iAd finds
the right audience for you.


95
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,786
In case of Manual, you get to
set the targeting preferences.


96
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,956
Let me set up Auto.


97
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:57,986
Next, country where
your ad is going to run.


98
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,066
I'm going to select
United States.


99
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:05,286
Next, Ad. Ad is a combination
of Creative and Destination.


100
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:08,456
I'm going to select
Banner for Creative


101
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:10,366
and Destination: iTunes.


102
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:15,136
iTunes destination refers to
the App Store product page


103
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,796
where user can review
the app details


104
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,176
and download the app
right from there.


105
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,116
Next, flight dates.


106
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:26,646
These are the dates during which
your campaign is going to run.


107
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:30,446
The default started is today
and ended is a month from now.


108
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,806
Let's leave it as is.


109
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:33,826
Next, budget.


110
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,166
How much money you are willing
to spend on this campaign?


111
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,406
Let me enter 2,000 dollars.


112
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,996
Daily Spend Goal is
automatically calculated.


113
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:47,916
CPC Bid: how much you are
willing to pay per click,


114
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,506
the maximum you're
willing to pay per click.


115
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:54,546
You may enter 50 cents.


116
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,456
Let's leave the CPA
Goal optional.


117
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:01,496
Clicking on Calculate will
give us the estimated number


118
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:04,726
of impressions and tabs.


119
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:08,516
If you want to see more
impressions and tabs,


120
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,526
you can change the combination
of targeting, budget,


121
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:17,056
and bid, and you'll see more.


122
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:18,586
Next, let's name our line.


123
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,876
I've used the term "line"
several times in this page.


124
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:23,216
What is line?


125
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:27,576
A line is a combination of
targeting, budget, and bid.


126
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:29,626
You can have several
lines in a campaign.


127
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,626
I'm going to name this
line, My Simple Auto Line.


128
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:39,756
Clicking on Next will take me
to the Targeting Summary page


129
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,856
where all the lines are listed.


130
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:44,436
For this campaign, we
have just one line.


131
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,626
You can always add more lines by
clicking on Create Line button.


132
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:54,226
Clicking on Next will take us to
step 3, which is Creating an Ad.


133
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,846
The first choice we have
is selecting a device


134
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:58,876
where your ad is going to run.


135
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,726
Klara is a universal app,
so the system detected that


136
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:05,136
and gave iPhone,
iPad on Universal.


137
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:06,556
Let's select Universal.


138
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:09,286
For language, let's
stick with English.


139
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:10,916
We have more choices
there as well.


140
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,796
Then let's define the creative.


141
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:18,166
There are two choices, Using a
Template and From My Desktop.


142
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:23,966
From My Desktop is
upload your own Banner.


143
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:27,366
But for now, let's
select templates.


144
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:31,276
We have built several templates
for you to make it easy.


145
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:36,666
As you can see, there
are different formats


146
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,466
for these templates.


147
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,476
Let me select marigold.


148
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:46,106
For title, let's give
the name of the app.


149
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:50,106
And for message, few
words about your app.


150
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:56,776
And for Call to Action, you
have several predefined ones


151
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,626
or you can always
enter a custom text.


152
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,486
I'm going to select
Download Now.


153
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:06,526
And here is the preview of
how your Banner is going


154
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,306
to look on the device.


155
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:10,106
You can click on View All Sizes


156
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:14,126
to see how we have prepared
this creative for iPhone, iPad,


157
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,056
portrait and landscape.


158
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:19,956
That's how simple it is.


159
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,056
Let's select their
destination, iTunes.


160
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:29,006
As you saw, as soon as I
selected the destination,


161
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:34,886
it's pointing to the
Klara iTunes product page.


162
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:38,056
For this ad to go live,
we need to associate this


163
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:40,316
with the line that
we just created.


164
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:45,056
I'm assigning to the line.


165
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:52,476
We give that name, Marigold 1.


166
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,686
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page


167
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,436
where you will see all the ads


168
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:58,806
that are created
for this campaign.


169
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:03,926
And you can always
create more Ads from here


170
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:05,566
by clicking on Create Ad.


171
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:09,066
Clicking on Next will take us
to the Campaign Summary page


172
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,946
where you can review all
the details in one place.


173
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:13,896
Where you're promoting,


174
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:16,946
what you're targeting,
what are your ads.


175
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,856
In case you have not
set up the payment yet,


176
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,636
which is a credit card,
you can always click here,


177
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:25,816
but let's Submit.


178
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:32,236
When you submit, the
creatives are submitted


179
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:33,966
for iAd's Certification review.


180
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,976
Once they are approved,
your campaign goes live.


181
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:39,746
That's how simple it is.


182
00:10:40,926 --> 00:10:42,086
Back to you, Paresh.


183
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:47,686
>> So next, let's take a deeper
dive at the tools, options,


184
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,676
controls, flexibility you have


185
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:53,596
in making advertising
work using iAd Workbench.


186
00:10:53,976 --> 00:11:02,526
We'll look at the choices you
have in choosing your audience,


187
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:08,326
the controls you have in
setting your price, the tools


188
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:11,446
and options you have to create
an ad that will make an impact,


189
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,366
and finally, the data
and insights you have


190
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:18,936
to understand your campaign
performance and optimize.


191
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,826
Let's start with
choosing your audience.


192
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:26,596
Selecting the right audience
for your app or product is key.


193
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,126
With iAd Workbench, we
make it very easy for you


194
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:32,516
to define your audience.


195
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:37,896
At the highest level,
you have two options.


196
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:39,686
Auto and Manual.


197
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:44,766
Auto targeting, which you saw
in the demo is the simplest


198
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:47,726
and probably the most powerful
option we have on iAd Workbench.


199
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:52,386
This is where iAd does all
the heavy lifting for you.


200
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,656
If you want control,
you can choose Manual.


201
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:01,396
When you choose Manual,
you'll have several options


202
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:03,666
to define your audience.


203
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:07,516
On the left side, you see
simple targeting options


204
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:12,256
like gender, age,
geo, and device.


205
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,566
You can choose, for age, you
can choose specific age groups


206
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:17,636
that you want to target.


207
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:23,206
For geo, you can choose
or specify states and DMAs


208
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:24,786
that you want to
target for your users.


209
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:29,366
On the right side, there are
some very powerful options.


210
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:35,046
Starting to the top, iTunes
Preferences is an option


211
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,486
that is exclusive to iAd.


212
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,036
This is where the
power of the App Store


213
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:44,026
and the iTunes Store
comes together


214
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:45,686
to help you find
the right audience.


215
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:51,616
When you make a selection here,
you're basically selecting users


216
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:57,066
who have actually downloaded
content in that category.


217
00:12:57,066 --> 00:13:01,406
So if you were to promote
a health and fitness app,


218
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,716
wouldn't it be great if you
could choose the audience


219
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,406
who like to download
health and fitness apps,


220
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:12,696
or who like to download
fitness and workout music.


221
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,856
With iAd Workbench,
you can do that.


222
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:17,776
It's very powerful.


223
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:22,206
The next three options
lets you define


224
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,766
where your ad wants-where
you want to show your ad,


225
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,206
which is App Channels.


226
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:30,336
When you want to show
your ad, that's scheduling


227
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:34,546
and how often do you want to
show an ad to a particular user,


228
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,076
which is frequency capping.


229
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:40,046
You can mix and match
any of these options


230
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,816
to define the right
audience for your campaign.


231
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:48,586
Next, let's look at the
flexibility you have


232
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:49,606
in setting your price.


233
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:55,046
With iAd Workbench, you
can choose how you want


234
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,236
to pay for your campaign.


235
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,606
If you want to pay for every
click, you can choose CPC.


236
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,806
If you want to pay for
every thousand impressions,


237
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:05,676
you can choose CPM.


238
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:10,416
The bid you enter is the
maximum you're willing to pay


239
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:12,006
when you win the auction.


240
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:16,086
iAd Workbench is a
bidded marketplace.


241
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:20,286
And on this platform, you
have the peace of mind to know


242
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:27,106
that you only pay a penny more
than the next highest bidder.


243
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:30,616
Now let's look at the options
you have in creating your ad.


244
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:33,256
There are a range
of options you have


245
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,066
when it comes to
selecting your ad.


246
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:40,876
You can have Banner Ads, Video
Ads, which are also known


247
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:45,246
as pre-roll, and Rich-Media Ads
if you want higher engagement


248
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:50,786
of the users with your ads.


249
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,426
Banner ads provide a
direct path to action.


250
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:58,016
Upon tap of a banner, you
can take a user directly


251
00:14:58,046 --> 00:15:01,016
to an iTunes product page
or to a mobile website.


252
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:04,816
Upon tap of a banner,
you can also take a user


253
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:10,146
and show them a video and then
take them to iTunes product page


254
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:11,386
or to a mobile website.


255
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,706
Let's take a look as an example
how a banner ad looks like.


256
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:21,456
Here's an app, you see the
ad will render at the bottom.


257
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:25,416
After a few seconds,
the ad will refresh,


258
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:28,916
the user engages with the ad.


259
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:33,316
And when the user clicks on it,


260
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:35,066
the user is taken
to the App Store.


261
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,266
The user can download
the app at this point.


262
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:42,036
Now once the user
downloads the app,


263
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,916
you don't show the same
download ad again to this user,


264
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:52,646
which means you don't waste your
money showing your ads to users


265
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,466
who already have your app.


266
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:58,696
Next is Video ads.


267
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:03,406
Video ads play automatically
before a video content.


268
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,866
They play directly
in fullscreen mode.


269
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:10,196
With video ads, you can also
have an optional call to action


270
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:11,836
which will take the user


271
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,896
to an iTunes product
page or a mobile website.


272
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:17,606
Here's an example of a video ad.


273
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,196
>> [Background Music]
You can chase light,


274
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:22,316
or let the light chase you.


275
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,776
Introducing LightRight,


276
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:26,896
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.


277
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:34,626
LightRight for iPhone, now
available in the App Store.


278
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,376
>> As you noticed, there
was a Learn More link


279
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,496
at the bottom of that video.


280
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,686
The user clicks on that Learn
More link and the user is taken


281
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:42,676
to the iTunes product page.


282
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:45,036
You can also have the user
go to a mobile website.


283
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:51,276
If you want to create rich-media
ads for more higher engagement,


284
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,906
you can do that using
iAd Workbench as well.


285
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,976
Upon tap of a banner, you
can immerse your users


286
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,676
into a very custom product
or brand experience.


287
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:06,046
You can choose any combination
of features and any combination


288
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:08,386
of call to actions to
create a rich-media ad.


289
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,356
I'll show you an example


290
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:14,586
that the client had actually
used really good features


291
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:16,376
to create a great experience.


292
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:17,675
Let's take a look.


293
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:19,326
Here's the app.


294
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,756
You see the ad being rendered.


295
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:27,056
The user taps on the ad,
and is taken-is immersed


296
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:28,185
into a brand experience.


297
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,056
The user can browse through
the pictures gallery.


298
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:39,776
The user is still
within the app.


299
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,566
You can take the
user to Facebook


300
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,486
so you can have a
Facebook integration.


301
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:46,206
You can have the user like
your page on Facebook.


302
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:52,906
You can have the reservations
module within the ad.


303
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,916
And finally, you can even
integrate the app download right


304
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,176
from this place.


305
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,016
So as you see, you
can do a lot of things


306
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,226
when it comes to rich-media ads.


307
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:08,126
Now that awesome ad was
created using a free tool


308
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:12,606
that is available to everyone
which is called iAd Producer.


309
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:19,196
With iAd Producer, you can
create highly interactive


310
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:19,846
rich-media ads.


311
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:24,266
They made it so easy for
you that you can just drag


312
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,916
and drop your assets
in a visual layout.


313
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,056
Or you can customize
the visual layout.


314
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:35,526
We provide you with an extensive
library of over 500 blueprints


315
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:37,156
which are like templates.


316
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:39,516
And when you use one
of these blueprints,


317
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,466
they come with built-in
performance and analytics


318
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:46,166
so you can see how your user
is engaging and interacting


319
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:47,996
with the rich-media ad.


320
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,436
And finally, with
iAd Producer 4.2


321
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,786
that was introduced
just two weeks ago,


322
00:18:53,826 --> 00:19:00,156
you have integrated iAd Producer
with Workbench, which means,


323
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,656
if you create an ad
using iAd Producer,


324
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,466
you can now upload it
directly on to Workbench.


325
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:12,516
And when you go to Workbench,
you'll have it available to use.


326
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,516
So once you create
your campaign,


327
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:20,326
your campaign is
running and you want


328
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,906
to see how the campaign
is performing.


329
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:26,126
When it comes to
campaign performance,


330
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:28,866
we provide you rich analytics


331
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,556
that helps you understand
how your campaign is doing


332
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,046
so you can take the
right actions.


333
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:36,556
We give you data,
performance metrics,


334
00:19:36,556 --> 00:19:38,946
as well as conversion metrics
which includes, you know,


335
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,906
what your spend is,
your capture rate is,


336
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,556
number of impressions you
got, as well as the downloads


337
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,946
that you've received so
you can tune your campaign.


338
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,236
We provide you this
data at every level


339
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,366
at the aggregate
campaign level as well


340
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:59,966
as at lower line and ad levels.


341
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:03,936
You can also download this
data as a .CSV file from any


342
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,876
of the analytic screens.


343
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:10,256
So, at this point, I'll ask
Ravi to walk us through some


344
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,676
of these tools and
options that we talked


345
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,766
about to make your
advertising work.


346
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,796
>> Thank you, Paresh.


347
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:22,926
In this demo, I'm going
to walk you through some


348
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:24,926
of the core concepts that
Paresh has mentioned,


349
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:29,596
touch and targeting, some of
the new ad formats analytics.


350
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,886
Let's get started.


351
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,936
I've been working on a
campaign I'm halfway through it,


352
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:39,056
let's finish this
campaign together.


353
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:46,086
I created a campaign and
created just one line


354
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:50,376
with a manual targeting
and I want


355
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,116
to finish-show you
what targeting I've set


356
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:57,416
up by editing the
line and later,


357
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,896
we'll add ads to this one.


358
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:10,146
A targeting option, we're going
to select as Manual and this-and


359
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,576
for the country, let's
leave it as United States.


360
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:17,026
And these are the
different targeting options


361
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:18,186
that we have available.


362
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:23,256
You can see all the options
on the left-hand side.


363
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:26,566
On the right, you will see the
options that we have selected.


364
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,176
By default, it's All.


365
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:35,936
Next, I'm going to target
few of the app references.


366
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:43,886
I'm going to select Lifestyle,
Photo and Video and Travel.


367
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:48,896
Then for App Channels, I
want to do similar thing.


368
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,946
I'm going to do Lifestyle,


369
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:56,946
I'm going to do Photo
and Video and Travel.


370
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:02,076
You can always select
more based upon,


371
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,066
you know, how it's performing.


372
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:08,486
For app type, last time we
did for creative: banner.


373
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:12,026
This time we're going to
do video as a creative


374
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:14,716
to a website as a destination.


375
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:17,666
My goal here is to drive
traffic to the website.


376
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:23,706
And for flight dates,
let's leave it as a default


377
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:27,226
and I've given some
spend, budget and bid here.


378
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:35,076
Let's go to the next step
where we can create an ad.


379
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:39,726
Here we have two choices,
a banner or a video.


380
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,776
Let's select video.


381
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:48,486
And where your ad-you want
your ad to run for devices


382
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,746
for maximum reach,
let's pick Universal.


383
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:54,926
For language, let's
keep it at English.


384
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,556
And here we are at a step where
we need to upload a video file.


385
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:05,436
iAd Workbench supports
two formats


386
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:09,216
for the video file,
.M4V and .MOV.


387
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:11,156
There are few more
specs here right here.


388
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,586
We encourage you to follow
the specs so you don't trip


389
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:15,666
on any validation errors.


390
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,656
Let's upload.


391
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:24,936
The file is being
uploaded from my laptop


392
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:28,556
to the Workbench
servers right now.


393
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:30,156
Once the file reaches
the servers,


394
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:34,006
the file will be transcoded
to multiple formats


395
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,336
to suit the devices
and resolutions


396
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:41,836
like iPhone high res, low res,
iPad high res and low res.


397
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:44,656
It's uploading right now.


398
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,386
Let it take its time.


399
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,556
I guess everybody is using
the network bandwidth I guess.


400
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:58,876
So, right now it seems like
the file has reached the server


401
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:00,926
as you saw the status
changed to Formatting.


402
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,886
This is when the video
transcoding is happening.


403
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:09,026
It's actually transforming the
video to suit the other devices.


404
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:12,536
Let's take a quick review.


405
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,776
>> [Background Music]
You can chase light


406
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:22,906
or let the light chase you.


407
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:24,356
Introducing LightRight,


408
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:27,676
an iOS bookmarking
tool for natural light.


409
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:37,796
LightRight for iPhone, now
available from the App Store.


410
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:38,536
>> That was a cool video.


411
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:42,056
I just want to highlight
one thing here.


412
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:48,446
For you as an advertiser,
prepare one file


413
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,056
to one technical
specification and be assured


414
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:57,746
that your ad-video ad is going
to run on all the Apple devices


415
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:06,136
in the best way possible,
so, that's how simple it is


416
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:10,806
to create a video ad here.


417
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:15,466
Use this ad format, we encourage
you to take advantage of it.


418
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:16,776
Let's select the destination.


419
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:19,916
As I said I'm going
to the website.


420
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,076
You can view the URL right here.


421
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:33,356
And then it will ask you for
the destination, for the name.


422
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,706
I like the name LightRight
website here.


423
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:38,276
So I'm going to leave it as is.


424
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:40,776
For this app to go live, you
need to assign to the line.


425
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:43,316
I'm going to assign to the video
line that I created earlier.


426
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:47,986
Let's name the ad.


427
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,476
I'm going to name it
as My Awesome Video.


428
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:00,446
Clicking on Next will take
us to the Ad Summary page.


429
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:07,456
So, that's the demo of the
powerful ad format video ad.


430
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:14,676
So far in my two
demos, we mainly focused


431
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:17,276
on creating a campaign,
on editing a campaign,


432
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,926
focused on a little bit on
targeting and ad formats.


433
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:24,146
Once a campaign is
created, the next thing


434
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:27,686
to focus is monitoring the
performance of the campaign


435
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:33,136
to ensure that it is going
towards the goal you have set


436
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:33,526
out for.


437
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,306
In order to monitor the
performance of the campaign,


438
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:41,206
we have some analytics.


439
00:26:42,576 --> 00:26:44,846
So, next, I want you to
take-I want to take you


440
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:45,846
to the analytics pages.


441
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:51,626
I have these two campaigns
that have been running


442
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,066
for the last 6 months.


443
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,886
I want to show the
performance of these campaigns.


444
00:26:57,086 --> 00:27:01,406
As you see the Dashboard
used the basic metrics spend,


445
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:04,486
impressions, TTR
and conversions.


446
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:09,386
You can click on any of these
metrics and go into the details.


447
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:14,556
By default, it gives
Since Campaign Start


448
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,426
and you have different custom
data groups you can select


449
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:21,356
that we have prepared for you.


450
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,146
Let me select last 30 days.


451
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:29,076
That's the spend for the last
30 days for this campaign.


452
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:32,456
Seems like we are spending
more in the weekends


453
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:34,786
and spend is coming down
during the weekdays.


454
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:38,986
You have different
metrics that you can view.


455
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:40,166
I've listed here.


456
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:48,276
And you can overlay any
metric on top of it.


457
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:50,746
Or if you want to compare
how you've been spending,


458
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,056
compare to the previous period,


459
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:56,316
you can always select
Compare with Previous Period.


460
00:27:57,256 --> 00:28:01,496
That gives you how the last 30
days is performing as opposed


461
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:06,296
to the previous 30 days.


462
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:08,246
Overlay is a pretty neat feature


463
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:17,166
where you can overlay any metric
here and compare to the spend.


464
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,596
I ordered average CPA metric.


465
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:22,226
It seems like we are doing less


466
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:23,646
than 2 dollars for
download here.


467
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:28,286
Let's go into the lines.


468
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,906
By default, it gives you
the cumulative number.


469
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:36,936
You can always select
Time, Time Series graph


470
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,376
to see how the lines
are performing.


471
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:42,116
It seems like we are spending
more on this line than this one.


472
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:50,026
And you can do similar
analysis on ad side as well.


473
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,066
By default, it gives you
the spend for cumulative.


474
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:56,466
You can always change
the metrics and change


475
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:57,566
to the time series graph.


476
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,626
We're pretty close on
these two ads here.


477
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:04,786
Let me go back to
the summary and find


478
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:05,686
out a couple of things here.


479
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,886
You can easily toggle between
a graph and a table view


480
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:10,156
if you choose to do so.


481
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:16,536
Or if you can scroll down and
you can click on Download CSV


482
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:22,136
to get a file onto your
desktop and do offline analysis.


483
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,676
And Download CSV is available
across the board on Dashboard


484
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:28,946
on every analytic
space that we have.


485
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:35,176
So, that's a quick
overview of, you know,


486
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:37,576
how to measure the
performance of your campaign.


487
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,056
All the data that I've been
showing in last 5 minutes,


488
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:44,376
that data is available
through the API.


489
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:48,346
So, next, I'm going to drop you
through the complete overview


490
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:51,216
of iAd Workbench API that
we have released this year.


491
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:54,966
So, your-you are an advertiser.


492
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,586
You have created
multiple campaigns


493
00:29:58,286 --> 00:30:00,336
and managing all
those campaigns.


494
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:03,756
And you want to scale
beyond the web interface.


495
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,696
API is for you.


496
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,076
Say you're an advertiser who
wanted to get the metrics


497
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,216
and incorporate it to
your own dashboards.


498
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:16,356
API is for you.


499
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,586
Let's get into the-more details.


500
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:22,456
You can also use it
for bulk operations.


501
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,176
API has two broad categories.


502
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:37,576
Reporting, where you can get the
metrics and perform the offline


503
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:38,636
and real-time analysis.


504
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:42,966
What do I mean by
real-time analysis here?


505
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,406
You can write a program for
example that runs at the top


506
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:50,446
of every hour, get some
metrics, analyze the data


507
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,296
and modify your campaign data.


508
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:57,426
You can trace the bid, start
and stop a campaign ad.


509
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,456
That's what I'm talking
about real-time analysis.


510
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:04,296
For offline analysis, you
can do your own dashboards.


511
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:11,196
And campaign management, you
can get the campaign details,


512
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:13,956
update the critical
campaign data and start


513
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,926
and stop campaign lines or ads.


514
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,996
Let's get into some very basics.


515
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,256
We're talking about API here.


516
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:29,876
For communication, API
uses JSON or HTTPS.


517
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:33,326
We want to keep the data
protocol pretty simple


518
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,896
so it's easy to understand
and it's easy to test.


519
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:41,266
We use JSON for data protocol
and secure HTTPS for security.


520
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:50,306
The next: authentication, we use
client certificates, private key


521
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:55,106
and access token as a
combination for authentication,


522
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,776
making it a very
strong authentication.


523
00:31:57,286 --> 00:32:02,616
And for key management, we want
to make it as easy as possible


524
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,896
so you can be having
web interface


525
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:08,086
for that on Workbench app.


526
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,466
So, how do you initiate
this API?


527
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:17,826
We have three basic
steps: download keys,


528
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,676
verify keys and integrate.


529
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:25,886
Go to Workbench,
go to the API page,


530
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,126
click on the Download
link to download the keys.


531
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:32,696
When you download the keys,
we give you a .zip file


532
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:34,446
that has keys and
sample programs.


533
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:39,826
And sample programs are
already embedded with your keys.


534
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:42,616
Run those sample programs
and verify the keys.


535
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:47,686
And then download the
API programming guide,


536
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:53,096
write your own programs,
deploy them on your servers


537
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:56,196
and integrate, that's
how simple it is.


538
00:32:57,946 --> 00:33:00,296
Let me quickly walk you through
some of the core methods here.


539
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:05,996
We have InitSession for session
initialization, which is key


540
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,506
because you need to pass the
sessionId for every method


541
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:11,476
that you are going to call
in your program for API.


542
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:18,106
Campaign method-metadata methods
to get the campaign details,


543
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:20,226
reporting API to
get the metrics.


544
00:33:20,226 --> 00:33:26,626
And campaign management
API to update the details


545
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:32,446
as well as start and stop.


546
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:33,856
Now, I'm going to
walk you through some


547
00:33:33,856 --> 00:33:36,926
of the sample program that
I've already done using the


548
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:39,136
highlighted methods
here, InitSession,


549
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:45,746
GetCampaignDetails
and UpdateLine.


550
00:33:45,746 --> 00:33:49,836
So, here is a sample program,
sample method where I'm trying


551
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:53,666
to pass access token,
prepare the request tab,


552
00:33:55,596 --> 00:34:00,386
post it to the server
then get the response back


553
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:03,646
and read the session from that,
sessionId from the response.


554
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:08,786
Once I get the sessionId,
I pass the sessionId


555
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:14,826
to getCampaignDetails method,
get the campaign IDs and filter


556
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:18,246
by running state, post
that to the server,


557
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:20,646
get the response back.


558
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:27,686
Next, for the campaign details
I got, I'm passing the LineId


559
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:29,005
for which I want to
increase the bid.


560
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:33,426
So I gave the line-SessionId,
LineId and the CPMBid,


561
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:40,096
post to server, and
get the response back.


562
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,275
That's how simple it is
to write the programs


563
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:49,206
to communicate with the API.


564
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:55,545
Powerful, secure and easy
to use, go try it out.


565
00:34:56,146 --> 00:35:00,746
With this, I'm going to
pass on to Paresh to walk us


566
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:02,026
through what's coming next.


567
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:03,486
There you go Paresh.


568
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,496
>> Thank you, Ravi.


569
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:08,286
It's fascinating what
you can do with the APIs


570
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,816
and how you can make bulk
changes to your campaigns


571
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:12,176
from your own user interface.


572
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:17,506
So, what's coming this fall?


573
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:21,146
So far, we've talked about
how iAd Workbench can help you


574
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:22,706
acquire new customers.


575
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:25,556
But that's just half the battle.


576
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:30,566
For you to grow your business,
you also need to re-engage


577
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:34,586
with your existing customers
and have them do more


578
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:39,566
of what you want, whether it's
spending more time in your app,


579
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:42,966
buying more of your products,
or even trying your new apps.


580
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:47,116
I came across a study
recently on the web


581
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:49,866
by a mobile analytics
firm, Localytics,


582
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:53,196
which said 22 percent
of the apps


583
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:58,286
that were downloaded were used
only once and over 60 percent


584
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,416
of them were used
less than 10 times.


585
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:05,516
Now, you want users
to frequently engage


586
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:07,346
with your app or your website.


587
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:11,766
Let's take a few examples
how engaged-re-engaging


588
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:14,076
with your customers can
help you grow your business.


589
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:19,816
First example is
about a game app.


590
00:36:20,706 --> 00:36:26,536
So you came up with a new iPad
version of your iPhone game.


591
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:32,326
Now, who will be the best
customers for this new app?


592
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:37,156
Of course, the users who
use that game on the iPhone.


593
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:44,296
What if you had a way to
connect with these customers


594
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:48,056
and inform them about
your new game?


595
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,126
And what if you could inform
them about this new game


596
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:56,966
when they are on their iPad?


597
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:59,296
Or, say you enhanced your app


598
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:01,466
and you added more
levels more game levels


599
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:05,886
or you have more things that
you want to sell in your app.


600
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:10,636
What if you had a way to
re-engage with the users


601
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:17,196
and show or promote these
levels only to users


602
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:20,416
who have reached certain
levels in your game


603
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:23,436
or show this merchandise
only to users


604
00:37:23,436 --> 00:37:28,086
who actually buy
merchandise like this?


605
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:32,796
And what about all those
users who downloaded your app


606
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:37,386
but haven't used it
in the last two weeks?


607
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:40,496
What if you had a way
to reconnect with them


608
00:37:41,356 --> 00:37:45,496
and motivate them to try-come
back and try your app again?


609
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:47,936
And what if you could
connect with them


610
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,046
when they're not in your app?


611
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:51,756
Let's take another example.


612
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,446
A retail app.


613
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:57,026
Say you have a retail app.


614
00:37:57,336 --> 00:38:00,576
Now, you have users who browse
through your product catalog


615
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,206
and add things to
the shopping basket.


616
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:08,896
Many of these users exit the
app before they actually make


617
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,706
a purchase.


618
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:16,416
What if you had a way to find
these users and bring them back


619
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:19,126
to finish the purchase and what


620
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:22,266
if you could bring them
back exactly at the point


621
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,326
where they had left
in the shopping basket


622
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,766
so they can finish the
transaction in next step.


623
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:33,776
And if you want to send offers
to your loyal customers,


624
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,416
what if you could
show these offers


625
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,496
to your loyal customers
irrespective


626
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:40,616
of what iOS device they are on?


627
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:47,066
And for users and your
customers who have items


628
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:50,326
in their wish list, what if
you could reconnect with these


629
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:54,436
and inform them when the items
on the wish list are on sale?


630
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:59,626
Now, in each of these
examples that we talked about,


631
00:38:59,826 --> 00:39:02,086
we talked about reconnecting


632
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,856
with a specific group
of audience.


633
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:08,486
Whether it's all the customers
who have downloaded your app


634
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:12,896
or the dormant users who
haven't used your app,


635
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:17,936
or the loyal users who do
purchases for you, or the users


636
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:22,186
who have an abandoned cart
on your shopping-on your app.


637
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:28,696
We call this group of
audiences as "segments".


638
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:32,976
Now there are probably
a million ways you could


639
00:39:32,976 --> 00:39:34,116
segment audiences.


640
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:38,246
You know your business and
your app, and your users best.


641
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:42,156
So you will segment your
users the way you want it.


642
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:45,326
And for you to easily
create segments,


643
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:49,876
we're introducing a new
functionality this fall


644
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:54,346
with iOS 8 which we call
Audience Segmentation.


645
00:39:55,736 --> 00:39:59,026
Building segments using Audience
Segmentation is very easy.


646
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,386
You can do it in just two steps.


647
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:08,686
The first one is you get
segment IDs from iAd Workbench.


648
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:14,496
Now, every segment is unique
so it has a unique segment ID.


649
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,846
You can download the segment
IDs from iAd Workbench.


650
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:20,286
Once you get the segment IDs,


651
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:24,546
you then integrate those
segment IDs in your app.


652
00:40:26,496 --> 00:40:29,886
You map the user behavior of
the functionality you have


653
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,466
in the app with these
segment IDs.


654
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,596
And when the user demonstrates
a particular user behavior


655
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:40,226
or reaches a functionality,
say reaches a particular level,


656
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:42,776
you instrument it in a way


657
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:48,136
that you automatically make API
call using the new iOS 8 SDK,


658
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:52,636
and pass that segment
ID onto Workbench.


659
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,736
Now when you do that,


660
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:59,366
your segments will automatically
start getting populated


661
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:00,296
on iAd Workbench.


662
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:03,986
Here's an example where
segmentation was done based


663
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:05,976
on time spent in an app.


664
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:10,616
To avail your segments, users
who have spent less than 1 hour


665
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:17,486
in the app, 1 to 10 hours, 10 to
20 and 20 plus hours in the app.


666
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:21,106
Now, if you were to reconnect
or re-engage with these users,


667
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:25,066
you would probably have a very
different strategy when it comes


668
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,506
to reengaging you with users
who have spent less than an hour


669
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:32,306
in your app compared to who
have spent more than 20 hours.


670
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:36,256
Here's another example


671
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:39,296
where segmentation is
based on levels of use.


672
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:44,536
Whenever a user reaches
a particular level,


673
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:47,276
they go from level 1 to level 2.


674
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:50,826
The API call that I talked
about is automatically made


675
00:41:50,826 --> 00:41:52,466
from the client side
from your app


676
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:54,866
and the right segment
ID is passed


677
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:57,736
and the user gets added
to this new segment.


678
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:01,616
So once you do segmentation
this way using iOS 8,


679
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:07,456
we can unlock some amazing
things which brings us


680
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,376
to the second thing that
we're introducing this fall,


681
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:12,096
we call it Audience Insights.


682
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:17,776
When your segments reach a
particular threshold of users,


683
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:22,576
we will show you unique audience
insights into your segments,


684
00:42:23,826 --> 00:42:26,826
all for free at no charge.


685
00:42:27,356 --> 00:42:29,306
These insights are
based on iTunes data.


686
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:33,556
So we'll show you how the
distribution is of the users


687
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:35,976
in your segment, the
demographic distribution.


688
00:42:36,936 --> 00:42:40,236
How age, gender, household
income distribution is


689
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:41,076
for these users.


690
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:46,666
We'll show you the top regions,
the top countries, top states,


691
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:51,556
DMAs these users come from, the
top languages these users have


692
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:53,976
on their devices as well


693
00:42:53,976 --> 00:42:56,176
as the top iTunes
preferences of these users.


694
00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:58,906
So you know what are the things
they really like to download.


695
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:02,086
Now once you have
these unique insights,


696
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,566
you can take some
very tangible actions.


697
00:43:06,256 --> 00:43:12,026
If you know the demographics of
your audience in the segment,


698
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:17,416
you can fine tune your app to
suit more of the demographics.


699
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:23,556
If you know the top regions and
the languages of your audience,


700
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:27,136
you might want to consider
localizing your app.


701
00:43:27,976 --> 00:43:30,736
If you have an English
app and you know


702
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,176
that the top region
is Asia Pacific


703
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:37,626
and the top language is
Japanese, you might want


704
00:43:37,626 --> 00:43:39,126
to make a Japanese app.


705
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:42,126
If you created a segment
of all your loyal users,


706
00:43:42,816 --> 00:43:45,756
now you understand
the characteristics


707
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,606
of those audience.


708
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:51,676
And then using Workbench
targeting, you can find more


709
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:55,096
of the same and you can
build your audience pool.


710
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,176
And finally, with
audience segmentation


711
00:43:58,926 --> 00:44:00,596
and audience targeting together,


712
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:03,966
we can bring you
another big thing


713
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:06,266
which we are also
introducing this fall


714
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:09,476
and we call it Audience
Retargeting.


715
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:15,786
Audience retargeting lets you
re-engage with every segment


716
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,916
that you have in
a customized way


717
00:44:18,176 --> 00:44:19,766
so you can give a
custom experience


718
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:21,506
through each of your segments.


719
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:25,306
So now when you have
those dormant users


720
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:28,916
who didn't use your
app, you can re-engage


721
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,856
with those users
with that segment.


722
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:34,626
Show them a custom message,
motivate them to come back


723
00:44:34,626 --> 00:44:35,526
and try your app again.


724
00:44:36,026 --> 00:44:40,966
And when you have users who
have reached a certain level


725
00:44:41,216 --> 00:44:43,026
and you want to push
them to the next level,


726
00:44:44,096 --> 00:44:46,946
you can create a
segment of the users


727
00:44:46,946 --> 00:44:48,746
who have reached say level 2.


728
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:51,946
Show them a custom
message about level 3.


729
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:56,306
When they engage with
that, take them to level 3,


730
00:44:57,306 --> 00:45:01,886
not open the app, deep link
them directly to level 3.


731
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,706
And those users who
had an abundant cart


732
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,976
in your retail app,
you can now re-engage


733
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:12,156
or retarget those
users irrespective


734
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:17,216
of what device they are on and
bring them back to your app.


735
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:23,176
And not only bring them
back, deep link them directly


736
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,486
to the shopping basket,


737
00:45:25,396 --> 00:45:30,256
so in the next step they
can finish the purchase.


738
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:31,786
So really anything is possible.


739
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:37,046
For each of your segments, you
can create that awesome message


740
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,746
and take the user to
wherever you want in the app


741
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:42,366
or even to any website.


742
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:45,096
Now that's not it.


743
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:49,656
With audience retargeting,
we'll actually find those users


744
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:52,756
for you on any iOS device.


745
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:58,106
So now when you had that example
but you introduce your iPad app,


746
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:03,736
a new app, now you can
find you iPhone app users


747
00:46:04,976 --> 00:46:06,096
when they're on the iPad.


748
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:11,326
So what we are introducing
here is a cross-app,


749
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,656
cross-device retargeting.


750
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:16,656
That is huge.


751
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:20,726
What else is unique about this?


752
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:24,186
The first thing is
automation that comes with it.


753
00:46:25,036 --> 00:46:28,536
When you build segments
using iOS 8,


754
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:32,056
your segments are automatically
updated in real-time.


755
00:46:33,396 --> 00:46:38,126
No more of manually harvesting
idea phase, sharing them


756
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:39,026
with your network partners.


757
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:43,716
Your data is most secure
when it's in one place.


758
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:47,536
And there's no better
place than Apple iAd.


759
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:51,266
When you create segments this
way, segmentation is automated,


760
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:54,786
audience insights run
based on segmentation,


761
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,206
that's real-time updated as well


762
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:01,606
as the audience retargeting
is updated in real-time.


763
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,406
The next thing is Privacy.


764
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,606
Audience retargeting and this
entire solution we talked


765
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:12,646
about is deeply integrated
with iOS.


766
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:15,576
So you get all the benefits


767
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:18,136
of the built-in privacy
controls that come with it.


768
00:47:18,576 --> 00:47:21,726
The solution complies with
the Limit Ad Tracking.


769
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:26,496
So now if you have a user
who has Limit Ad Tracking on,


770
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:30,256
that user is removed
automatically from the segments.


771
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:33,006
So the user is not retargeted.


772
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:35,476
Everything is automated.


773
00:47:36,306 --> 00:47:37,396
You have nothing to worry about.


774
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:42,756
So with Audience
Segmentation, Audience Insights,


775
00:47:43,316 --> 00:47:45,516
and Audience Retargeting,


776
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:50,186
iAd becomes-iAd Workbench
becomes a complete solution.


777
00:47:51,256 --> 00:47:54,616
You can, not only acquire
new users and new customers,


778
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:59,566
you can now understand your
existing users and re-engage


779
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:01,336
with them to grow your business.


780
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:03,466
What else is coming?


781
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:07,256
We'll be introducing two
new ad formats this fall.


782
00:48:08,356 --> 00:48:11,546
Interstitial ads which are also
called as fullscreen banners


783
00:48:12,686 --> 00:48:15,346
and Medium Rectangle
also call as MREC.


784
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:18,556
Both these ad formats
will be available


785
00:48:18,556 --> 00:48:20,706
on iPad as well as on iPhone.


786
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:24,926
So with that, you will have
four ad formats to choose:


787
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:30,346
the banner ads, video ads,
interstitials and MREC.


788
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:33,366
The next is we're going


789
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:36,556
to continue enhancing
the iAd Workbench APIs.


790
00:48:37,476 --> 00:48:39,876
We'll introduce iAd
Workbench API 2.0


791
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:42,866
which will give you a
full read-write campaign


792
00:48:42,866 --> 00:48:43,896
creation capability.


793
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:47,576
So if you work with a
Demand Side Partner,


794
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:51,886
also called as DSP, you
can now have your DSP plug


795
00:48:51,886 --> 00:48:55,876
into iAd Workbench and
create and manage campaigns


796
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:59,066
on your behalf from their
own UI ad interface.


797
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:01,176
That's a move towards
programmatic buying,


798
00:49:02,016 --> 00:49:04,946
automated way of
booking campaigns


799
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:06,506
and managing them
from your own UI.


800
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:09,246
We'll also provide you APIs
for segmentation that we talked


801
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,776
about just in-a little bit ago.


802
00:49:11,536 --> 00:49:13,746
And finally, we'll continue
with the geo expansion.


803
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,736
We'll go in more countries
and there is bunch more things


804
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:17,716
that we have in plans for you.


805
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:22,976
So to summarize, as
you saw in the demos


806
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:25,946
and throughout the talk, iAd
Workbench is the simplest way


807
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:27,416
for you to reach Apple users.


808
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:31,276
It's very powerful and
it's open to everyone.


809
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:34,436
So if you haven't tried
iAd Workbench yet,


810
00:49:35,396 --> 00:49:41,246
go to iadworkbench.apple.com and
log in with just your Apple ID.


811
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:44,126
Make sure you take advantage of
the APIs that we reviewed today.


812
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:47,166
And the new ad formats
that are available now


813
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:48,166
and coming in fall.


814
00:49:49,526 --> 00:49:53,366
And finally, the key thing,
make sure you enable your app


815
00:49:54,636 --> 00:49:58,126
for segmentation so you
can get those free insights


816
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:01,046
that we just talked about
and you can also re-engage


817
00:50:01,446 --> 00:50:02,476
with your current customers.


818
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:06,846
If you have more
questions, please reach


819
00:50:06,846 --> 00:50:08,836
out to our evangelist,
Mark Malone.


820
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:16,816
We have lots of documentation
on iAd Online Workbench Help.


821
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:21,126
And you can also find us in
the Apple Developer Forum.


822
00:50:21,656 --> 00:50:26,186
There was a session which
is very related to some


823
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:27,896
of the things that we
talked about today.


824
00:50:27,896 --> 00:50:29,076
It was yesterday.


825
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:32,416
In case you missed it, make
sure you watch it later on.


826
00:50:33,486 --> 00:50:34,986
In that session,
we talked about how


827
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:36,966
to use the API for segmentation.


828
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:38,156
So if you're interested in that,


829
00:50:38,156 --> 00:50:40,496
make sure you take
a look at that.


830
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:40,886
That's it.


831
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:43,386
Thank you and have a great WWDC.
