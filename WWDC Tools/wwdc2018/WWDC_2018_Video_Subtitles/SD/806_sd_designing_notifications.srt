[ Applause ]


3
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:25,306
>> Good morning.


4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,066
Good morning, everyone.


5
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:28,956
How's it going.


6
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:31,106
It's nice to see everyone today.


7
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:32,336
Hopefully you've enjoyed the


8
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:33,256
conference this week.


9
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:35,896
We're really happy to be here to


10
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:36,966
start off the last day.


11
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,386
So, my name is Jon Dascola, and


12
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:40,356
later I'll be joined by my


13
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:41,716
colleague Heena Ko.


14
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,366
We're both designers on the


15
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,876
human interface team here at


16
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:45,206
Apple.


17
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:46,696
And we're going to talk about


18
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,076
designing great notifications.


19
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,416
So, this year in iOS 12, we


20
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,616
introduced a lot of great


21
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:54,306
feature to really enhance the


22
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,036
notification experience, both


23
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:57,636
for you and everyone that uses


24
00:00:57,636 --> 00:00:58,136
your apps.


25
00:00:58,496 --> 00:00:59,616
And we think these features are


26
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:01,536
really powerful, and could


27
00:01:01,536 --> 00:01:03,266
create a meaningful, but also


28
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:06,086
mindful experience for everyone.


29
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:08,636
But, before we get into what's


30
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,066
new, I think it would be helpful


31
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,596
to take a trip down memory lane


32
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:13,466
and see how the notification


33
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,916
experience has evolved over the


34
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,396
years, because knowing how we


35
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,036
got here will help us make a


36
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:18,686
better future.


37
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:21,586
So, when iPhone launched, every


38
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:23,496
alert was a blue box, model


39
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:23,776
alert.


40
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:24,916
Do you guys remember this?


41
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:26,866
Every notification, every


42
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:28,646
message, every invitation, it


43
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,076
was an interruption that needed


44
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:31,676
to be dealt with immediately.


45
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:33,306
Nothing would be on the lock


46
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,416
screen, so at times, it was


47
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,236
pretty cumbersome when you'd


48
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,186
unlock the phone, right?


49
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:38,706
Whatever missed messages you


50
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,096
received were backed up and


51
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,876
would appear a single box at a


52
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:42,236
time.


53
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:43,656
So, you could either ignore


54
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:45,806
them, one at a time, or if you


55
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,146
wanted to reply, you launched


56
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:48,306
into the app to take action.


57
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:52,036
Then, in iOS 4, as more apps


58
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,306
were sending push notifications,


59
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:54,746
we started to queue them up on


60
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:55,426
your lock screen.


61
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:57,036
So, now people could see all of


62
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:58,666
their missed notifications at a


63
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,466
glance and choose the specific


64
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,786
one they wanted to interact


65
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:01,876
with.


66
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,796
A swipe on that row would launch


67
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:05,346
into the app but all the other


68
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:06,586
ones would be dismissed from the


69
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:07,126
lock screen.


70
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,246
And they all went up to


71
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,056
notification center.


72
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:11,536
And that was a way to access all


73
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:12,526
the other things you had missed.


74
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:14,646
So, because so many


75
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,646
notifications were being


76
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,136
accumulated, this became a


77
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,766
really useful place to go and to


78
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,616
see all the other activity on


79
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:22,676
your phone.


80
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,506
Next, we introduced rich


81
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:25,196
notifications.


82
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,606
As the quantity of notifications


83
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,536
was increasing, we wanted to


84
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,666
increase their quality.


85
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:32,786
Rich notifications are a great


86
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,266
way to provide more context and


87
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,806
information around each


88
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:36,496
notification.


89
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:38,116
That way you can see one,


90
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:39,996
understand what it's for and get


91
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:41,176
the extra information that you


92
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,526
need to take action.


93
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:44,116
And it all happens right in


94
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:44,366
line.


95
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:45,976
You don't need to launch into


96
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:47,226
the app and lose the context of


97
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:47,826
what you're doing.


98
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,256
And that leads us to where we


99
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:51,816
are today and all the work that


100
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:52,836
we've done to enhance the


101
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:54,786
notification experience in iOS


102
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:55,036
12.


103
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:57,456
So, we're going to talk about


104
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,266
some features that make the


105
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,166
world better for you, as app


106
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:00,746
developers.


107
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,346
Ways to make your notifications


108
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,036
more valuable, useful, and


109
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:04,606
organized.


110
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,016
And then, we'll talk about how


111
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,226
those features can create a


112
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:08,656
better experience for everyone.


113
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,336
But before we get going, can we


114
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:13,876
take a moment and be candid?


115
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,596
Can we talk about the current


116
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:16,866
state of notifications?


117
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,856
Maybe not always the greatest.


118
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:20,936
You know, people are getting a


119
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:21,826
lot of interruptions.


120
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:23,206
And they're not always for the


121
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:24,266
right reasons, right.


122
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,456
And we have way more apps than


123
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,166
ever before.


124
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:28,196
And they're sending more


125
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,376
notifications than ever.


126
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:31,906
And because people are seeing so


127
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:33,446
many notifications, it's so


128
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,766
important to make sure that


129
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:35,936
we're creating a really great


130
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:37,656
experience for everybody that


131
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:38,326
uses your app.


132
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:40,676
Because the best notifications,


133
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,916
they're for connecting and


134
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,146
communicating with people.


135
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:44,666
I mean, that's what makes iPhone


136
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,306
great, that real human


137
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:46,756
connection.


138
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:49,226
And then, you know, we have


139
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:50,216
social notifications.


140
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,676
I totally understand how these


141
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:52,416
are important, right?


142
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:53,796
People want to stay on top of


143
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:54,676
their digital lives.


144
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:56,416
Everyone likes their likes.


145
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,346
And then there's even the


146
00:03:58,346 --> 00:03:59,566
occasional notification about


147
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,736
new sneakers or something, that


148
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,126
could be super fun and really


149
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:02,566
useful.


150
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,576
But not all of these things all


151
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:05,136
of the time.


152
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,446
Again, all things in moderation.


153
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,836
So, as more apps are continuing


154
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:11,576
to send more notifications and


155
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:13,626
taking more of our attention, we


156
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:14,496
really have to make sure we're


157
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:16,676
doing the right thing.


158
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:17,736
We need to remember that the


159
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:18,935
best notifications are for


160
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:20,716
connecting people and delivering


161
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,156
meaningful information.


162
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:24,086
Now, I know none of you here


163
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:25,536
would ever do any of this, but


164
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,146
there are some app developers


165
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,466
that maybe go a little bit


166
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:29,076
overboard.


167
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:30,706
And this year, we've created a


168
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,096
UI that makes it easier for


169
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,006
people to control how their


170
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,336
notifications are delivered.


171
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,516
And there's even an option to


172
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,436
turn off all the notifications


173
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:40,326
from an unhelpful app.


174
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:42,766
So, in iOS 12, when you receive


175
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,756
a notification on the lock


176
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:46,486
screen, you could swipe left and


177
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,146
access some actions, and you'll


178
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:49,336
notice this year, we've added a


179
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,066
manage button.


180
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:52,726
Tapping that brings in our newly


181
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,946
designed quick tuning UI, which


182
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,366
allows you to configure how the


183
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,996
notifications from that app are


184
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:58,686
being delivered.


185
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:02,266
So, at the top, the first option


186
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,246
is to deliver quietly.


187
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:05,066
And these quiet notifications


188
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,976
will be send directly into your


189
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:08,406
notification center without


190
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:08,926
interruption.


191
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,286
It did not appear on the lock


192
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:10,696
screen.


193
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:12,386
It did not play a sound or


194
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,386
haptic, or present as banners.


195
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,666
And I think this is a really


196
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,386
great option for an app that's


197
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:18,536
sending you notifications that


198
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:19,056
you want.


199
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:20,816
Content that you're interested


200
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,376
in, but you don't necessarily


201
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:24,246
need to be interrupted by for


202
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:25,246
every new post, right?


203
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,446
So, you can access these


204
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,296
notifications now on your own


205
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:28,736
terms.


206
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,876
But also, right here in the card


207
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:33,876
is a button to turn off all


208
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,236
notifications from that


209
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:35,936
particular app.


210
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:38,226
And we think having that


211
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,636
shortcut is really handy.


212
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:41,736
But having to use it, it's not a


213
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,156
great experience for anyone.


214
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,646
We don't want people to have to


215
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:45,936
turn off notifications because


216
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:47,436
they're annoyed or frustrated.


217
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,396
And as developers you don't want


218
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:50,536
to lose the privilege to reach


219
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,056
out to those individuals, right?


220
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:53,676
So, by the time we're done here,


221
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:54,476
we want to make sure that you


222
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:55,406
have all the tools and


223
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:56,936
information you need to make


224
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:57,816
sure you're sending only the


225
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,506
most meaningful notifications


226
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:00,096
that you can.


227
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:02,406
Because if you send great


228
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:03,966
notifications, you'll be, making


229
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,016
everyone who uses your app


230
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:05,376
happy.


231
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,126
And if you've got happy people


232
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,616
using your app, that's going to


233
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:09,396
make you happy.


234
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,396
And if you guys are all happy


235
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,416
and they're happy, that's going


236
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,666
to make Heena and I real happy


237
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,026
today.


238
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:15,996
And being happy is good, right?


239
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:18,836
So, let's get into it and talk


240
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,116
through the notification journey


241
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:21,216
and how to create the best


242
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:22,506
notification experience.


243
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,146
We're going to start with the


244
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:25,336
first run prompt, in that


245
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:27,476
initial agreement and talk about


246
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:28,616
all the best ways for you to


247
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:29,916
make sure your notifications are


248
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,206
allowed and delivered.


249
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:33,666
Then we'll talk about the best


250
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,216
ways to provide value with all


251
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,116
the notifications that you're


252
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:36,526
sending.


253
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:39,016
Better ways to organize your


254
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:40,526
content with notification


255
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:40,926
grouping.


256
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:42,516
And finally, how to make the


257
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:44,386
most of rich notifications to


258
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:45,826
create a really useful and


259
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,126
holistic notification


260
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:47,706
experience.


261
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,916
So, let's get started and talk


262
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,226
about that first prompt in


263
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:52,266
asking for permission to send


264
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:52,896
notifications.


265
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:55,006
This is a familiar screen,


266
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:55,356
right?


267
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:57,436
It's your one and only


268
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:58,666
opportunity to receive


269
00:06:58,736 --> 00:06:59,516
permission to send


270
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:00,176
notifications.


271
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:01,676
And it's an important moment.


272
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,236
And you should remember that


273
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:04,276
you're asking someone to make


274
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:05,626
the difficult decision here.


275
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,076
I mean put yourself in their


276
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:07,746
shoes right.


277
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:08,926
They just downloaded your app.


278
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:10,316
They're excited to give it a run


279
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:11,186
for the first time.


280
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:11,896
And then all of the sudden,


281
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,446
they're interrupted.


282
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:14,096
And then they're asked make this


283
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:15,476
decision about receiving


284
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,246
notifications.


285
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:18,256
How are they supposed to know,


286
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:18,526
right?


287
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:20,016
Especially if it's presented


288
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:21,656
without any context and you're


289
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:22,656
not letting them know why


290
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:24,996
notifications are valuable, and


291
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,416
if they've really had any time


292
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,676
to experience your app.


293
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:28,856
I mean why should they tap


294
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:29,286
allow?


295
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,136
So, this happens, right?


296
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:31,946
They don't.


297
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:33,386
And that was it.


298
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,586
You had one shot, one


299
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,026
opportunity to send


300
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:37,676
notifications.


301
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,206
And that was your only way to


302
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:39,996
ask for permission.


303
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:42,416
Well, in iOS 12, that's no


304
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,116
longer the case.


305
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,456
We've created a new feature that


306
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:46,886
allows you to send notifications


307
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:48,616
directly and only into


308
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:50,236
notification center, without


309
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,506
running that initial prompt.


310
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,596
It's your choice.


311
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,186
You can continue to show the


312
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:55,866
prompt and ask for the privilege


313
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:56,916
to send notifications to the


314
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,236
lock screen with the risk of


315
00:07:59,236 --> 00:07:59,886
being denied.


316
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:01,356
Or, you can choose to deliver


317
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,126
your notifications quietly and


318
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:04,476
directly in the notification


319
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:04,746
center.


320
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:06,976
So, they'll appear like this in


321
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,146
your notification center list.


322
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:09,366
And if we look a little more


323
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,046
closely, you'll see the content


324
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,316
within the notification platter


325
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:13,976
is presented as it always is.


326
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,506
Your information comes through


327
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:16,646
as a normal notification.


328
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,336
But at the bottom, we extend


329
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,616
down the platter and we add some


330
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:21,026
buttons.


331
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:23,126
Now the prompt is integrated


332
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,426
within a notification.


333
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:25,746
It's less disruptive.


334
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:27,236
It's a non-model experience.


335
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,736
So, you won't be stopped when


336
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:29,716
you're in the middle of using


337
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,276
that app and being asked about


338
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:31,946
notifications.


339
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,256
You see the prompt right when


340
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:33,746
you're looking at your


341
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,535
notifications center.


342
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,876
And the prompt now provides more


343
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:38,535
information.


344
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:40,596
It's presented with in an actual


345
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:41,316
notification.


346
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:42,716
So, I can see what sort of


347
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:43,986
content the app will provide.


348
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,786
And now, I'll have a better


349
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,116
understanding of their purpose


350
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:48,876
so I can better judge their


351
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,866
quality, and be better informed


352
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:51,846
to make that decision.


353
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,006
So, let's look at some different


354
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:55,456
categories of apps and talk


355
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:56,466
about how they might go about


356
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,406
requesting permission.


357
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:59,456
So, we have social apps, news


358
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,716
apps, games.


359
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:02,856
And let's focus on a news app


360
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:03,416
for a moment.


361
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,986
Let's imagine we're creating a


362
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,816
new news service from scratch


363
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:08,526
and we're working out our


364
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:09,286
notifications.


365
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,166
Well, should we go to the


366
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,316
directed notification center


367
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:12,426
route?


368
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,916
I mean that seems like a good


369
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:14,586
idea, right?


370
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:15,816
I mean there's a group of people


371
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:16,876
out there that are interested in


372
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:17,326
news.


373
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,476
Maybe they're curious about


374
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:19,526
what's going on in the world.


375
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,856
But they don't feel the need to


376
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:22,356
be interrupted for every single


377
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:23,396
article that's posted.


378
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:24,646
You know, especially if they've


379
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:25,676
just downloaded the app and


380
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:26,716
they're unsure of the content


381
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:27,446
they might receive.


382
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,026
I think the directed history


383
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:32,046
route makes a lot of sense.


384
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,716
But, you know I also see a very


385
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:35,186
clear use case to ask for lock


386
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,426
screen access too, right?


387
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:37,936
People love breaking news.


388
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,116
They want to be on top of what's


389
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:40,666
going on in the world, as soon


390
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,616
as it happens, right?


391
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:44,746
I get it. So, what do we do?


392
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:46,926
Well, if we start with the new


393
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,206
world and talk about the cases


394
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:49,526
that could be sent directly to


395
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:50,446
notification center.


396
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:53,536
So, if your app is sending


397
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:54,806
content that can be consumed


398
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:56,706
passively, and doesn't require


399
00:09:56,706 --> 00:09:58,386
critical or timely responses,


400
00:09:58,626 --> 00:09:59,446
then I think the directed


401
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:00,766
notification center route is


402
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,656
your best approach.


403
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,116
It ensures that your content is


404
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:03,676
delivered.


405
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:04,856
It won't interrupt people.


406
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:06,686
And most importantly, it gives


407
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,346
them an opportunity to see your


408
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:09,556
content and try your


409
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:10,916
notifications before they have


410
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:11,656
to commit to it.


411
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:13,796
So, if our news app is sending


412
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,616
longform articles, I think that


413
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,416
makes sense, right?


414
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,666
Or, social apps.


415
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,766
I think they can deliver their


416
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,826
likes and comments quietly.


417
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:22,456
Games that are sending out


418
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:23,636
promotional notification.


419
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,766
Examples like that, I think they


420
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,246
make sense to go direct to


421
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:28,036
notification center.


422
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:31,156
Now let's take a moment and talk


423
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:32,976
about the traditional route.


424
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:34,056
What sort of use cases make


425
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:34,586
sense here?


426
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,366
Well, if your apps need to


427
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,996
deliver notification content


428
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:39,846
immediately, if people need to


429
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:40,996
see your notifications the


430
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:42,436
moment that they're posted.


431
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,486
Or your app requires an urgent


432
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,566
response to notifications, ask


433
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:47,226
for permission.


434
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,716
You know, maybe that news app is


435
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:50,626
breaking news.


436
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,796
Or your social app has a big


437
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:54,776
messaging component, or games


438
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:55,426
where you need to see your


439
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:56,196
friends online.


440
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:57,586
If you've got an app like that,


441
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,306
then go for it.


442
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:00,316
I think that makes a ton of


443
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,656
sense to ask for lock screen


444
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:02,156
access.


445
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:03,716
But if you do, there's a few


446
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:05,016
things to keep in mind while


447
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:05,736
you're designing that


448
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:06,436
experience.


449
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,626
Because if you do create a great


450
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,016
experience here, I think it will


451
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,866
greatly increase the probability


452
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,156
that your notifications are


453
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,676
going to be allowed.


454
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,646
So, don't prompt or send this


455
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,096
alert as soon as people launch


456
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,186
your app for the first time.


457
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,426
You know, give them a moment to


458
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:22,786
experience your app, what you've


459
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:23,716
built and what you have to


460
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,156
offer.


461
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:26,706
And find a place within your app


462
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:27,556
to explain why your


463
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:28,556
notifications are going to be


464
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:29,136
valuable.


465
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:30,376
Let them know why you're sending


466
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:31,176
notifications.


467
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:32,786
And more importantly, why they


468
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:33,996
need to appear on the lock


469
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:34,366
screen.


470
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,906
And finally, that prompt, well


471
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,116
post it at the right time.


472
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:40,486
Present it when someone


473
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:42,756
understands the reason why


474
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:43,336
they'll be receiving


475
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,406
notifications from your app.


476
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:45,516
Like if you're a delivery


477
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,166
service, wait for someone to


478
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,936
complete their order and explain


479
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,246
the notifications will update


480
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,406
them on its progress.


481
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:52,876
Or if you're a travel app,


482
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,736
notifications will be for flight


483
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,496
delays and gate changes, right.


484
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,676
Because in either scenario, with


485
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,026
the direct to notification


486
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,086
center route or this one we want


487
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,666
you to have the best opportunity


488
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,086
to deliver your notifications.


489
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:09,766
So, that's what's new when


490
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:10,916
asking for permission to send


491
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,686
out notifications.


492
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:13,046
Remember, it's up to you.


493
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:14,976
Both approaches are valuable and


494
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,086
both should be considered.


495
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:17,296
It's a decision that you're


496
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,026
going to need based on your app


497
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:20,856
and your app's particular


498
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:21,316
content.


499
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:24,586
So, now that you've taken all


500
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,136
the right steps to make sure


501
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,186
people will be receiving your


502
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:28,016
notifications.


503
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:29,476
Let's talk about how to make


504
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:30,536
sure you're setting the best


505
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:32,456
content in making notifications


506
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:34,476
like extremely valuable for


507
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:34,926
everyone.


508
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:37,636
And why is it so important that


509
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:38,446
we're sending out great


510
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:39,246
notifications?


511
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,436
It's because our attention is


512
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:42,066
valuable.


513
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:45,156
Our attention is precious.


514
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:47,036
Right? Interrupting people, it's


515
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:48,146
a real privilege.


516
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:49,836
And we need to respect that.


517
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,456
I mean you've all felt this


518
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:51,716
right?


519
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:52,986
You're trying to focus on


520
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:54,716
something, you're in the zone.


521
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:56,006
I mean maybe it's happened this


522
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:56,996
week, you're updating all your


523
00:12:56,996 --> 00:12:58,116
apps to adopt these great new


524
00:12:58,116 --> 00:12:59,456
APIs and then all the sudden


525
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,036
[ding].


526
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:01,736
You're interrupted.


527
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,126
And you stop.


528
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,416
And you lose focus.


529
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,246
And when the wrong thing comes


530
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:07,366
at the wrong time it's


531
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:07,946
frustrating.


532
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,306
So, you've got to be extra


533
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:10,736
considerate when we're sending


534
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:11,426
notifications.


535
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,386
First off, we need to make sure


536
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,206
we're sending great content and


537
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:18,686
providing the highest quality of


538
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:19,196
information.


539
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:20,216
Everything you said in a


540
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,696
notification has got to be


541
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:22,216
meaningful.


542
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:23,946
Every notification should


543
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:25,366
provide a specific purpose.


544
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:26,726
Each notification should have a


545
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,426
specific message to communicate


546
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:29,566
or a task to complete.


547
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:31,306
Notifications are not just a


548
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,696
reason to get people to launch


549
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:33,346
into your app.


550
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,256
So, Dark Sky, it's a really


551
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,666
lovely weather app that sends


552
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,626
particularly meaningful


553
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:39,356
notifications.


554
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:41,826
See, I think the interesting


555
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:43,786
thing about the weather is you


556
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:45,756
really need to know about the


557
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,346
weather once it's different.


558
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,516
You know, if there's a change in


559
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:49,136
conditions.


560
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:50,916
And that's when Dark Sky sends


561
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,946
these notifications, right?


562
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:52,986
Rain is starting soon.


563
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:54,056
That's what I need to know.


564
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:54,986
Just really smart.


565
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:57,996
Door Dash is another great


566
00:13:57,996 --> 00:13:58,436
example.


567
00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:01,566
You get your notification when


568
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:02,236
your food arrives.


569
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:03,816
I mean everybody gets excited


570
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:04,686
when their dinner is here, like


571
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:05,566
what more do you need to know?


572
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:06,236
It's perfect.


573
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:08,736
And HQ does the right thing with


574
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:09,576
their notifications.


575
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:12,926
For a live game that requires


576
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:14,446
you to be online at a specific


577
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:16,186
time, a notification like this,


578
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:19,356
it makes a ton of sense.


579
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,306
So, what do they all have in


580
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:20,726
common?


581
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,296
Well, all those notifications,


582
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:24,026
they served a clear purpose.


583
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:25,386
They were presented for a


584
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:27,336
specific reason with real


585
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,006
information.


586
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,366
They weren't just empty


587
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,816
invitations to launch into your


588
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:31,026
app.


589
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:34,806
So, now that you're sending out


590
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:35,986
really great content.


591
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,616
It's important to consider when


592
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:38,846
you're sending that content.


593
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,516
So, be considerate when you


594
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,826
deliver notifications.


595
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:43,626
And reminders is great.


596
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,136
You can choose whether you want


597
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:45,926
your notification to be


598
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,866
delivered by time, or by


599
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,446
location.


600
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:49,916
So, you get the appropriate


601
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,106
content whenever you need it.


602
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:54,216
And Headspace is great, they're


603
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,166
one of my favorite apps.


604
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,606
It's a meditation app that


605
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:58,146
really helps with focus and


606
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:58,576
clarity.


607
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,296
So, I think it's appropriate


608
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:02,026
that they let me choose when a


609
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,916
reminder comes through.


610
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:03,956
Because it would be terribly


611
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,766
ironic if they were the ones


612
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:06,716
sending me frustrating


613
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:08,586
notifications at inopportune


614
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:09,556
times throughout the day.


615
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,046
Headspace is really great.


616
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:13,486
And here, I love this screen


617
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:14,326
with CNN, right.


618
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,516
After you allow alerts, they ask


619
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,536
you to choose the alert


620
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,226
frequency.


621
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,006
So, it's up to me to decide how


622
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,336
often I would like to receive


623
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:21,996
their content.


624
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:23,656
It's such as smart way to manage


625
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,026
and configure your notifications


626
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:25,276
you know.


627
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:26,856
Because as a user, now I have


628
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:28,276
some expectations around what


629
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,576
that notification experience


630
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:29,916
will be.


631
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,746
And here's a notifications from


632
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:33,326
Duolingo.


633
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:36,436
So, I was trying to learn a new


634
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:36,926
language.


635
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,646
I got a bit distracted here


636
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,986
working on this presentation, so


637
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:40,936
I missed a few sessions.


638
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,766
And rather than continuing to


639
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,186
send me notifications that I'm


640
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,826
not interacting with, they


641
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:46,716
decided to pause them.


642
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,216
And I just think that's really


643
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:49,816
considerate.


644
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:51,326
Because I could totally


645
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,546
understand the argument right,


646
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,776
why they might want to send me


647
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:55,586
more notifications at a time


648
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,936
like this and really encourage


649
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,416
me to get back and re-engage


650
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:58,976
with the app.


651
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,806
But with the new tuning features


652
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,366
we announced, if I get annoyed


653
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,826
by those notifications, I can


654
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,666
easily turn them all off.


655
00:16:06,346 --> 00:16:07,936
So, for them, doing the right


656
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,846
thing in the short term, while


657
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,046
it might seem like the harder


658
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,686
decision to make, I think it's


659
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:13,676
going to pay off in the long


660
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:13,896
run.


661
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,586
So, in all cases, it's really


662
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,416
important to consider how and


663
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:19,656
when you're delivering


664
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:20,506
notifications.


665
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:23,746
And finally, we want to make


666
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,116
sure your people are in control


667
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,186
of the content that they're


668
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:26,726
receiving.


669
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,136
I mean there's a real trust


670
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:29,376
relationship that's created when


671
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:30,546
someone allows notifications


672
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:31,106
from your app.


673
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,186
They're making space for you to


674
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:33,986
interrupt them with your


675
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:34,856
content, right?


676
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:36,356
And as we've discussed, it


677
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,856
should be really valuable.


678
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,446
But not all things have that


679
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:41,716
same level of value or


680
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:43,606
importance to all people.


681
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,396
So, let's talk about giving


682
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:46,706
everyone control on how their


683
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,086
content is delivered, right?


684
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:49,486
So, we've redesigned settings


685
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,786
this year to more clearly


686
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:52,676
visualize the different delivery


687
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:53,856
methods of notifications.


688
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:55,736
We hope that with more clear and


689
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:57,876
graphic UI, it will make it


690
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,306
easier for people to adjust how


691
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:00,246
they're receiving your different


692
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:00,886
notifications.


693
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:02,966
And if you notice at the bottom


694
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:04,826
here, we've also added a link to


695
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,425
your third-party custom


696
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,366
notification settings.


697
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,366
And providing that link is even


698
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,086
more important now because of


699
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:13,205
our new tuning UI.


700
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,846
Because if someone decides to


701
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,146
tap turn off, we don't just


702
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:18,496
immediately stop all the


703
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,886
notifications from that app, but


704
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:21,356
we present a confirmation step.


705
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,356
So, in this action sheet, you


706
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:24,736
could choose to turn off all


707
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:25,596
notifications from the


708
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:28,106
particular app, or tap a button,


709
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,316
to go into that app's particular


710
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:31,726
custom notification settings.


711
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,376
And again, we want people to be


712
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,856
in control of the types of


713
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:36,116
content that they receive.


714
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:37,816
So, while we hope that turn off


715
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:39,196
everything button is a last


716
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:40,926
resort, we want to encourage


717
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,376
people to get into your app


718
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,276
settings and customize the


719
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:45,936
notification categories you have


720
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:47,016
in a more granular way.


721
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:49,176
So, with this extra visibility


722
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:51,076
you know it's really important


723
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:51,976
to make sure these settings


724
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:52,966
pages are well-designed.


725
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:54,296
So, let's look at a few


726
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:54,686
examples.


727
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,066
ESPN is an app with really


728
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:58,836
detailed settings.


729
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:00,246
And they've done a great job


730
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:00,936
with their design.


731
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,096
There's like a great sense of


732
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,396
hierarchy and all of their


733
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:05,486
content is tailored to my


734
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:05,936
interests.


735
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:07,726
And when I drill down and see


736
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,456
the screen, they have specific


737
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,926
details for each type of


738
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:11,916
notification that you can


739
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:12,346
receive.


740
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,686
You know, basketball is


741
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:14,586
different than baseball.


742
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:15,876
Right. I have all the controls


743
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,736
that I need to receive exactly


744
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:19,216
the right notifications from


745
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:19,736
ESPN.


746
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,916
And "The New York Times" app is


747
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,276
great.


748
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,876
I have the options to configure


749
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,106
the different categories or


750
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,066
different sections that are


751
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:27,606
alerting me.


752
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:30,626
You know I might not find sports


753
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,196
or politics helpful, but I can


754
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,736
still receive breaking news and


755
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:34,536
top stories.


756
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:35,976
And I think this is really smart


757
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:36,966
for "The New York Times" to have


758
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:37,396
implemented.


759
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:38,666
Because not everyone may


760
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,596
appreciate interruptions every


761
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,106
single category that they offer.


762
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:43,976
So, for allowing this topic


763
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:45,876
level control, it assures people


764
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:47,706
to configure the experience to


765
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:49,346
their liking without resorting


766
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,376
to turning off all notifications


767
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:52,336
from that app.


768
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:54,896
So, it's really important, this


769
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,136
set of control is supported in


770
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,746
your app in a well-designed way.


771
00:18:57,746 --> 00:18:58,526
All right.


772
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,216
So, those are the important


773
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:02,376
things to remember when creating


774
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,096
notifications.


775
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:04,166
Now, you're going to be sending


776
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,196
out some really valuable


777
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:05,876
information.


778
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:08,596
The next thing is to talk about


779
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:09,716
notification grouping.


780
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,426
And this is a new feature in iOS


781
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:12,926
12 to help everyone keep their


782
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:14,486
notifications, you know all


783
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,436
those great, and valuable


784
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:17,096
content you'll be receiving,


785
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:18,516
more organized.


786
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:21,176
So, in iOS, we've always


787
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,726
appreciated the convenience of


788
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,036
seeing notifications on the lock


789
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:24,356
screen.


790
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:26,826
The chronological list is really


791
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:27,766
helpful to organize.


792
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:30,936
And it's great to see the


793
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,616
content of notifications without


794
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:33,446
having to interact with the


795
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:34,096
device.


796
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,266
You just pick up the phone and


797
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:37,596
everything is there, it's all


798
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:37,966
visible.


799
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,656
But you know, there gets to be a


800
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:41,606
point where that long


801
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,326
chronological list starts to


802
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:43,956
break down.


803
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,296
Whenever there's a lot of


804
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:46,416
different content coming on the


805
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,106
screen, right?


806
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:48,496
Especially multiple messages, or


807
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:49,276
if you have group chats


808
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:50,526
happening all at the same time,


809
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:51,756
it's really difficult to follow.


810
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,216
So, that's when we decided to


811
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,586
start grouping notifications.


812
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,946
Now, all your related content is


813
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,796
organized together.


814
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:01,016
A simple tap on each group


815
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,496
expands it open and you can


816
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:04,206
interact with each notification


817
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:04,956
individually.


818
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,196
And by default, notifications


819
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:08,646
will group together by app.


820
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:11,226
And for most cases, that make


821
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:11,796
sense.


822
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:13,716
But you know there's some


823
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:14,946
circumstances when sorting them


824
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:16,736
out in a more detailed way can


825
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:17,286
be helpful.


826
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:19,236
And messages is a perfect


827
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:19,686
example.


828
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,136
I don't think it would be the


829
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,646
most useful thing to see every


830
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:23,916
missed message from every


831
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,376
conversation thread and group


832
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,786
chat you're having all lumped


833
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:28,176
together into a single group.


834
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,356
So, to more clearly organize


835
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:32,136
everything we create a new group


836
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:33,486
for each conversation.


837
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,836
And we call each individual


838
00:20:34,836 --> 00:20:35,866
group a thread.


839
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:38,696
So, let's take a moment and talk


840
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,556
about notification threads and


841
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:41,896
what the best ways may be to


842
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:42,886
organize your content.


843
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:44,686
So, notification grouping uses


844
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:46,276
the existing thread identifier


845
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:46,636
API.


846
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,016
This API was introduced as part


847
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,326
of the notification content


848
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:50,956
extensions.


849
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,366
We expanded its use to create


850
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,326
notification groups.


851
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,736
The thread identifier can be any


852
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:58,256
string that you want and the


853
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,626
notifications with the same


854
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,216
thread identifier are all


855
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:01,826
grouped together.


856
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:02,756
That's it.


857
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:03,646
Super simple.


858
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:07,556
So, threads make a lot of sense


859
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:08,256
and you have separate


860
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,756
conversations to group together.


861
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,096
But what about other types of


862
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:11,646
content?


863
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:12,936
How should we handle grouping in


864
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:13,436
those cases?


865
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:14,946
Well, let's look at news.


866
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,636
Each source is broken out into a


867
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:17,346
separate thread.


868
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:19,426
You can see there's a group from


869
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:20,406
"The New York Times."


870
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:23,946
A group for Quartz, and a group


871
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:25,026
from "The Washington Post."


872
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:27,746
And it's a really helpful way to


873
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,596
find and organize content


874
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:32,196
delivered from the news app.


875
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:33,546
And let's look at another


876
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:33,976
example.


877
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,946
Podcasts. They really do the


878
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:36,716
smart thing with their


879
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:37,526
notifications.


880
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:39,946
They create a special thread


881
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:41,376
that groups together all of your


882
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:42,486
new episodes.


883
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:44,076
And what they do is they


884
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:45,616
resisted the temptation to


885
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,876
declare each individual Podcast


886
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:48,936
a separate thread.


887
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:51,076
Because remember, threading is


888
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,186
about consolidating and


889
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,406
organizing your content.


890
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:54,776
So, when scrolling through your


891
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:56,046
notification history, I think


892
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,596
it's a much better experience to


893
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,976
see all new Podcast episodes in


894
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,776
a single group, rather than a


895
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:03,056
bunch of discrete groups


896
00:22:03,296 --> 00:22:05,146
separated out and mixed together


897
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,606
amongst all of your other missed


898
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:07,326
notifications.


899
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:08,796
Because, if there's a single


900
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,716
group, a tap will expand it open


901
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:12,386
and reveal all of the related


902
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:12,956
content.


903
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:14,776
Everything is together.


904
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,646
Everything is organized.


905
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:20,406
And everything is easy to find.


906
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:21,456
So, while threads can be


907
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,046
incredibly valuable, it's really


908
00:22:23,046 --> 00:22:24,516
important to not create too


909
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:24,906
many.


910
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:26,696
They should be used to highlight


911
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:27,976
and distinguish meaningfully


912
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:29,596
different types of content.


913
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:31,326
So, remember it's okay to leave


914
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,716
the default behavior of grouping


915
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:33,826
all of your apps notifications


916
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:34,136
together.


917
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:35,306
Often that's going to be the


918
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,406
best experience for people to


919
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:38,066
find and interact with your


920
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:38,446
content.


921
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:41,146
All right, so that's


922
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:42,646
notification grouping, and I


923
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:43,506
think we're doing pretty good so


924
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:43,836
far.


925
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:45,006
You know, people have agreed to


926
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:46,356
receive your notifications now.


927
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:47,736
You're respecting their


928
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:48,326
attention.


929
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,746
You're sending good content at


930
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:50,716
relevant times.


931
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:52,206
If it makes sense for your app,


932
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:53,136
you're grouping your content


933
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,546
together by a few relevant


934
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:55,026
threads.


935
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,176
We're moving.


936
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:57,646
Now, we need to make sure the


937
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:59,076
rich notifications are rounding


938
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:00,476
out the experience.


939
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:03,336
And it's just so important, it's


940
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:04,566
really important to create


941
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,016
useful rich notifications.


942
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:07,466
Because as I mentioned earlier,


943
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:08,806
rich notifications are a way to


944
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,576
provide more context and


945
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,236
information to each


946
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:12,976
notification.


947
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:14,916
Now, we want people to take


948
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,706
action on them, without losing


949
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:17,916
the context of what they're


950
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:18,386
doing.


951
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:21,096
I say, like every notification


952
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,286
should be like a little


953
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:23,516
self-contained package of


954
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:25,416
information to allow me to


955
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,846
complete a specific task.


956
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,256
I shouldn't have to launch into


957
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,106
the app to find value in a


958
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:30,806
notification.


959
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:32,366
And photos is a great example.


960
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:33,726
I can see that my friend added a


961
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:35,126
new image to a shared photo


962
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:35,526
stream.


963
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:37,966
And with 3D touch, when I touch


964
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,326
on it, I can see the big,


965
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:41,616
full-sized version of the image


966
00:23:41,616 --> 00:23:42,486
that was added.


967
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:44,036
And below there's a description.


968
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,556
And with the quick action


969
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:46,956
buttons, I can either like it,


970
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:48,586
or leave a comment right in


971
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:48,886
line.


972
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:50,186
I don't need to leave the


973
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:51,486
context of what I'm currently


974
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:53,056
doing to take action on the


975
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:53,746
notification.


976
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:54,736
I tap like.


977
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,646
I swipe it away and I'm back to


978
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:57,226
the lock screen.


979
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:00,226
Calendar is another great


980
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:00,636
example.


981
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:02,316
I see I have an invitation to an


982
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,346
event on my lock screen.


983
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:05,306
And I use 3D touch and press on


984
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:07,836
it, I see my availability right


985
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:08,676
in the notification.


986
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:10,466
Again, I don't need to launch


987
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:12,156
into Calendar to see my day.


988
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:13,616
And then there's some great


989
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:14,716
quick options below.


990
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:15,946
I can accept the invitation


991
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:16,816
right in line.


992
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:19,986
So, if we look at messages, with


993
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:21,136
our new notification grouping


994
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:22,916
UI, my conversation with Heena


995
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:24,166
is all grouped together.


996
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:26,306
Now, when I press on the


997
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:27,886
notification group, I'm seeing


998
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:29,756
all of that group's content


999
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:30,306
together.


1000
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:32,896
All of the individual platters


1001
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:33,926
that were stacked in the group


1002
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:35,656
are consolidated together in


1003
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:36,196
this view.


1004
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:37,756
I can read the entire thread


1005
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:38,206
right here.


1006
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:41,376
And now, in iOS 12, we've added


1007
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:42,796
interactivity to the rich


1008
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:43,786
notification views.


1009
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:46,366
So, you can double tap on a


1010
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,316
specific messages bubble and


1011
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:49,796
access our tap back UI.


1012
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:52,196
So, I tap like, and I can send


1013
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:53,526
that acknowledgment right back


1014
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:53,886
to Heena.


1015
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:57,646
So, as we mentioned, if you've


1016
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:59,066
created individual threads for


1017
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,486
your content, you can also have


1018
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:02,516
a threaded or consolidated rich


1019
00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:03,206
notification.


1020
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:04,906
So, if we look at Podcasts.


1021
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:06,566
All of their new episodes are


1022
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:07,996
grouped together here on the


1023
00:25:07,996 --> 00:25:08,546
lock screen.


1024
00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:10,646
When I press on that stack, I


1025
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:12,186
get a single rich notification


1026
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:13,756
that summarizes each of the new


1027
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:15,426
Podcast episodes that have been


1028
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:15,846
released.


1029
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:17,856
There's a custom design with


1030
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:18,806
each show's artwork.


1031
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,376
The episode title and a short


1032
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:21,906
description.


1033
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:23,786
And because we can have discrete


1034
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:25,416
tap regions, there are separate


1035
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:27,086
play buttons for each episode.


1036
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:28,546
I mean, I just think this


1037
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:29,446
example is great.


1038
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:30,756
It checks all the boxes for


1039
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:32,196
making a great rich


1040
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:32,976
notification.


1041
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,086
There's detailed content, nice


1042
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:37,526
images, custom controls, and


1043
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:38,376
rich interactions.


1044
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,146
It's a great way to finish the


1045
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:42,736
notification experience.


1046
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:47,116
So, to summarize, when it comes


1047
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:48,646
to that first run experience,


1048
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:50,416
you have the question, did you


1049
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,836
ask for lock screen access, or


1050
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:52,996
deliver quietly in the


1051
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:53,836
notification center.


1052
00:25:54,226 --> 00:25:55,266
Well, I think it depends on your


1053
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:55,766
content.


1054
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:56,956
Is it timely?


1055
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,216
Does it require an urgent


1056
00:25:59,216 --> 00:25:59,846
response?


1057
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,726
Then go on, ask for permission


1058
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,816
to send notifications to the


1059
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:03,386
lock screen.


1060
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:05,286
If you're sending passive


1061
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:07,106
content that doesn't require an


1062
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,636
immediate response, then


1063
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:09,936
delivering directly to


1064
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,146
notification center could be the


1065
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:13,196
right approach.


1066
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,216
But either way it's your


1067
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:15,976
decision to make.


1068
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:17,186
This should be based on the


1069
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:20,866
needs of your app.


1070
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:22,216
Next, we need to make sure we're


1071
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,066
really providing value with our


1072
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,036
notification content and sending


1073
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:27,346
just like the highest quality


1074
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:28,026
notifications.


1075
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:30,086
So, they need to be meaningful


1076
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:30,636
content.


1077
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,026
We should be sending specific


1078
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:32,646
information.


1079
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:34,996
Notifications are not just a


1080
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,626
reason to launch into the app.


1081
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,916
And we've got to have a


1082
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,036
well-designed settings and


1083
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:41,446
configuration UI so people can


1084
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:42,836
easily tailor their notification


1085
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:46,166
experience from within your app.


1086
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,016
Notification grouping it's a


1087
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,096
great way to organize your


1088
00:26:49,136 --> 00:26:49,696
content.


1089
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,556
So, by default, all notification


1090
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:52,596
from your app will group


1091
00:26:52,636 --> 00:26:53,096
together.


1092
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:54,896
And you can use the threat


1093
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:56,856
identifier to create threads, if


1094
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:58,756
you need more nuanced grouping.


1095
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:01,136
But remember, only create


1096
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:02,396
threads when necessary.


1097
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:04,106
Don't overdo it.


1098
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,886
And finally, rich notifications


1099
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,496
should be created to provide


1100
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,036
that extra bit of content around


1101
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:10,786
the notification.


1102
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:13,336
Each notification should be a


1103
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:14,926
specific task to complete.


1104
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:18,096
You can add images, video,


1105
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,816
audio, and custom content.


1106
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:22,986
And now, interactivity to create


1107
00:27:22,986 --> 00:27:24,606
a holistic notification


1108
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:25,156
experience.


1109
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:29,496
So, I mean that was a lot,


1110
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:29,736
right?


1111
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:30,956
That was a lot to take in, a lot


1112
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:32,566
to do, a lot to consider.


1113
00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:33,896
But, it's not everything.


1114
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:35,336
There's still something else to


1115
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:35,896
consider.


1116
00:27:35,896 --> 00:27:38,106
And for a lot of people it's the


1117
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:39,066
most important.


1118
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,546
And it's definitely the most


1119
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:41,886
personal part of the


1120
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:43,096
notification experience.


1121
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:44,786
The Apple Watch.


1122
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,496
So, I'd like to invite my fellow


1123
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:48,366
designer, Heena Ko here, to talk


1124
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,006
about making great notifications


1125
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:50,986
on the Apple Watch.


1126
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:51,896
Thank you.


1127
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:57,136
[ Applause ]


1128
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:58,266
>> Thanks, Jon.


1129
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:03,826
Okay. So, we just heard about


1130
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:06,726
the importance of notifications


1131
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,416
on the phone.


1132
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,806
So, why think about


1133
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:10,746
notifications on Apple Watch?


1134
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,306
Well, we consider Apple Watch to


1135
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:14,556
be our most personal device.


1136
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:16,056
It states unlocked on your


1137
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,546
wrist, so you stay connected.


1138
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:19,316
But because it's so lightweight,


1139
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:20,296
you can stay focused on what


1140
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:20,876
you're doing.


1141
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,376
And particularly for Apple


1142
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,356
Watch, notifications are really


1143
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,056
great and incredibly effective.


1144
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:29,486
They're glanceable and the


1145
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:30,516
interactions are lightweight.


1146
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:34,756
And great notifications, they


1147
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,376
send you valuable and timely


1148
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:37,206
information.


1149
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:40,586
Or, they can encourage you to


1150
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,026
reach your health goals.


1151
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:44,886
And in some cases, they tell you


1152
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:46,696
critical information, like if


1153
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:48,546
you've had an elevated heart


1154
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:51,846
rate.


1155
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,356
Notifications are an essential


1156
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,496
part of the Apple Watch


1157
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:55,106
experience.


1158
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:56,906
In fact, we'd go as far as


1159
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,236
saying that notifications are


1160
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,126
the primary way people interact


1161
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:04,026
with apps on Apple Watch.


1162
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:05,796
There's another important reason


1163
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:06,786
why you may want to think about


1164
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,076
notifications on Apple Watch,


1165
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:09,806
and that's because they can be


1166
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:10,986
pushed to either device.


1167
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:13,886
You see, we coordinate alerts.


1168
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:15,176
So, we send them to the device


1169
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:16,546
that's most accessible to you.


1170
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,776
So, if your phone is locked,


1171
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:20,906
it's in your bag, in your


1172
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,286
pocket, which is a lot of the


1173
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:24,096
time, then that notification


1174
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,086
gets sent to the watch.


1175
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,196
So, you want to make sure that


1176
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:29,046
that notification looks great in


1177
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:29,826
both places.


1178
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:34,746
Okay, so here's a picture I took


1179
00:29:34,746 --> 00:29:35,906
on a hike on Mount Tam the other


1180
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:36,146
week.


1181
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:37,996
It's really beautiful up there.


1182
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:41,426
While I was going on a hike


1183
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:43,246
without my phone, I was able to


1184
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:44,406
get this notification from Dark


1185
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:45,766
Sky about an upcoming


1186
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:46,486
thunderstorm.


1187
00:29:47,196 --> 00:29:48,696
So, now, with Apple Watch Series


1188
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,726
3 with cellular, notifications


1189
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:51,976
on the watch are more important


1190
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:52,346
than ever.


1191
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:55,296
I can go hours without my phone.


1192
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,316
And still receive notifications


1193
00:29:57,316 --> 00:30:00,976
and stay connected.


1194
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:02,996
Okay, so you may ask, how do I


1195
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:03,946
make them look great on both


1196
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:04,556
devices?


1197
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:07,186
Well, we try to make it as easy


1198
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:08,886
as possible for you by giving


1199
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:09,726
you some stuff for free.


1200
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:11,906
So, let's take a look.


1201
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:14,876
Take this notification from one


1202
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:16,266
of my favorite Podcast Apps


1203
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:16,926
Castro.


1204
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:20,396
When that phone notification is


1205
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:21,826
pushed to the watch, some


1206
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:23,036
elements come with it with


1207
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:23,806
minimal work.


1208
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:27,026
Like, the image attachments, as


1209
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:34,166
well as the title, the body, and


1210
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:36,156
any relevant quick actions.


1211
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,246
So, here I'm able to add this


1212
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:40,676
Podcast app to my queue from my


1213
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:42,456
watch, so it's right in my phone


1214
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:45,846
when I want to listen to it.


1215
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:47,466
By simply adding a few


1216
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:49,036
additional elements, the watch's


1217
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:50,896
notification experience is so


1218
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:54,906
much better.


1219
00:30:55,096 --> 00:30:56,406
Okay, so there are additional


1220
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:57,766
ways you can customize your


1221
00:30:57,766 --> 00:30:58,706
watch notifications.


1222
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:01,626
You can add a sash color.


1223
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:03,636
You can add a background color.


1224
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:06,646
You can add images, icons and


1225
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:08,476
even inline video to make your


1226
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:09,976
notifications more visually


1227
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:10,826
rich.


1228
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:14,406
Okay, and now if you have a


1229
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,896
WatchKit app you can create


1230
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:17,176
interactive notifications.


1231
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:19,016
Interactive notifications are a


1232
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:20,826
new feature in WatchOS 5.


1233
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:21,986
They allow for more


1234
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:23,206
interactivity right in the


1235
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:24,896
notification, so you don't even


1236
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:25,636
have to launch the app.


1237
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:26,816
We're really excited about this


1238
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:26,956
one.


1239
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:31,536
Okay, so here's a notification


1240
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:32,986
from a fictitious ride sharing


1241
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:33,226
app.


1242
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:34,496
You guys know this.


1243
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:35,846
We all get these after every


1244
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:36,516
single ride.


1245
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,166
And occasionally I'll open the


1246
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,546
app and rate the ride right


1247
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:40,776
after the ride is over.


1248
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:43,836
But sometimes, actually a lot of


1249
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:45,566
times, I forget to do it.


1250
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:49,246
So, now in WatchOS 5 apps can


1251
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:49,956
create interactive


1252
00:31:49,996 --> 00:31:50,826
notifications.


1253
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:52,926
Here's one from DiDi, I ride


1254
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:53,406
sharing app.


1255
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,446
So, they've included the ability


1256
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,986
to rate and pay right in the


1257
00:31:56,986 --> 00:31:57,726
notification.


1258
00:31:58,056 --> 00:32:00,316
I just have to rotate the


1259
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:02,626
digital crown, tap the stars,


1260
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:04,896
hit pay, and I'm done.


1261
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,646
So, this is a great example of


1262
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:08,406
an interface that clearly


1263
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:09,906
communicates the purpose of that


1264
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,506
notification, which is to


1265
00:32:11,506 --> 00:32:13,426
encourage me to submit a rating


1266
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:14,156
after my ride.


1267
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:18,576
Pay By Phone is an app that


1268
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:19,556
allows you to pay for your


1269
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:20,566
parking spot remotely.


1270
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,196
It's really convenient when I'm


1271
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:23,686
still really far from my car and


1272
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:24,846
I need to extend my time.


1273
00:32:25,596 --> 00:32:26,816
Here's a notification from them,


1274
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:28,076
letting me know that I only have


1275
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,326
10 minutes left on my parking


1276
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:29,666
spot.


1277
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,636
It allows me to extend my time


1278
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:32,696
right in the long look.


1279
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:35,526
I just have to rotate the


1280
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:36,966
digital crown, and I tap


1281
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:38,906
steppers, and that's all I have


1282
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:41,256
to do to extend my time.


1283
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:43,206
So, this is a great example of a


1284
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:43,986
quick interaction.


1285
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,676
I was able to extend my parking


1286
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:51,086
time with just a couple of taps.


1287
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:52,856
So, amongst my friends, I'm


1288
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:53,966
oftentimes the person that


1289
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:55,146
chooses the restaurant and makes


1290
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:56,126
dinner reservations.


1291
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:57,796
And because of traffic and


1292
00:32:57,796 --> 00:32:58,936
weather, you name it, people are


1293
00:32:58,936 --> 00:32:59,856
always running late.


1294
00:33:00,406 --> 00:33:03,096
So, here's an interactive


1295
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:04,586
notification from Yelp, letting


1296
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,096
me know that my table is ready.


1297
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,746
And these new notifications,


1298
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,166
they allow me to extend my


1299
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:12,736
checking time and in this one,


1300
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:14,586
for up to 45 minutes right in


1301
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:15,366
the notification.


1302
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:16,806
So, we don't need to give up our


1303
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:18,106
table if people are running


1304
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:18,396
late.


1305
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:24,646
Okay, so rich notifications are


1306
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:26,116
particularly good for moments of


1307
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:27,126
quick data input.


1308
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,786
Here's a notification from a


1309
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:30,236
fictitious medication reminder


1310
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:30,476
app.


1311
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:31,976
It's reminding me to take my


1312
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,386
medication before the end of the


1313
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:33,676
day.


1314
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:37,186
So, it not only reminds me to


1315
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:38,246
take my medication at the right


1316
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:40,266
time, but it also provides a


1317
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:41,606
range of ways to respond.


1318
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:42,996
I can say I took a single


1319
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:44,336
medication, or I can tap the


1320
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:45,686
take all button to say that I've


1321
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:46,246
taken both.


1322
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,396
So, this is really great,


1323
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,456
because this is something that I


1324
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:50,736
had to do every single day.


1325
00:33:54,246 --> 00:33:55,596
Okay, so what do these


1326
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:56,766
notifications have in common?


1327
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:58,646
Well, they were informative.


1328
00:33:59,216 --> 00:34:00,256
At the same time, they're


1329
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:00,866
succinct.


1330
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:04,476
They were visually rich.


1331
00:34:04,596 --> 00:34:06,386
These used images, videos, and


1332
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:08,146
icons to make the notifications


1333
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,166
much visually richer.


1334
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:12,606
They're actionable.


1335
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:14,656
I was able to accomplish a tone


1336
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,156
of things without even having to


1337
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:19,106
open the app.


1338
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:21,096
And lastly, interactions on the


1339
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:22,136
watch are best when they're


1340
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:22,255
quick.


1341
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:23,255
We're going to make


1342
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:24,716
notifications richer, but we


1343
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:25,676
don't want to recreate the app


1344
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:25,976
experience.


1345
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:31,686
Okay, something you can do to


1346
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:33,085
make notifications even more


1347
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,755
effective is to get to know your


1348
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:34,985
audience.


1349
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:38,036
And tailor notifications to


1350
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:38,636
individuals.


1351
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:40,085
It can make a huge difference in


1352
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:43,366
how they experience your app.


1353
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:45,216
My Weather is an adorable app


1354
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:46,295
that sends me forecast


1355
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,025
notifications every morning and


1356
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:49,596
it's customized to my location.


1357
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:54,376
I really love receiving


1358
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:55,996
notifications from Wallet on my


1359
00:34:56,045 --> 00:34:56,456
watch.


1360
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:57,986
It's especially great, when


1361
00:34:57,986 --> 00:34:58,896
you're at the airport, and


1362
00:34:58,896 --> 00:34:59,686
you're dealing with lots of


1363
00:34:59,686 --> 00:34:59,946
luggage.


1364
00:34:59,946 --> 00:35:01,226
Or you're at the store dealing


1365
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,046
with lots of groceries, they're


1366
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,086
also really handy when going to


1367
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:04,496
concerts.


1368
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:06,536
So, here's a concert ticket I


1369
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:07,306
got from Wallet.


1370
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:08,706
It arrived right when I got to


1371
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:08,926
the venue.


1372
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,956
It also contained a full-screen


1373
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:15,616
QR code that allowed me to enter


1374
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:17,036
the venue and I didn't even have


1375
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:17,866
to pull my phone out.


1376
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:20,416
This is a great example of


1377
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,906
customizing the timing of when I


1378
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:23,236
received a notification.


1379
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,706
It arrived right when I needed


1380
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,906
it and provided me with


1381
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,276
everything I needed for the


1382
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:27,626
event.


1383
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:33,026
Okay, so Qantas Airlines has


1384
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:34,236
really great interactive


1385
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,916
notifications, and they allow


1386
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:36,976
you to share your flight time


1387
00:35:36,976 --> 00:35:38,596
with that clutch friend that's


1388
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:39,586
going to pick you up from the


1389
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:39,786
airport.


1390
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:41,676
Here, my friend Gabriel has just


1391
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:42,856
sent me his trip information


1392
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:44,526
through the Qantas app.


1393
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,646
It includes his ETA, as well as


1394
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,876
the option to set up a pickup


1395
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:50,116
reminder, which I'm totally


1396
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:52,776
going to use.


1397
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:54,126
Later in the evening, I'll


1398
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,186
receive the pickup reminder,


1399
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:56,726
along with a suggested time to


1400
00:35:56,726 --> 00:35:56,976
leave.


1401
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:00,256
And it shows me exactly where I


1402
00:36:00,256 --> 00:36:02,826
can pick him up, as well as the


1403
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,666
options for directions and it


1404
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,986
includes the option to send him


1405
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:07,186
a message letting him know that


1406
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:07,756
I'm going to be late.


1407
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:09,936
So, must know that I'm in LA.


1408
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,436
This is an excellent example of


1409
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:14,156
customizing notifications along


1410
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:14,776
an entire journey.


1411
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:17,246
They utilize time and location


1412
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:18,466
as well as just simply providing


1413
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:20,096
helpful tools to make sure


1414
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,616
people have a great experience


1415
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:26,266
from start to finish.


1416
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,656
Okay, so, at this point,


1417
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:28,706
everyone here should be a


1418
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:29,776
notification expert.


1419
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:31,256
But we covered a lot.


1420
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:35,096
So, let's do a quick recap.


1421
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:39,896
Okay the first run prompt.


1422
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:41,616
Notifications are oftentimes


1423
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,126
sensitive.


1424
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:43,936
But if they're not considering


1425
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,316
sending notifications directly


1426
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:46,286
to notification center.


1427
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:47,946
You won't be interrupting people


1428
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:49,286
and folks can read them on their


1429
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:49,836
own time.


1430
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:54,156
Providing value and sending


1431
00:36:54,156 --> 00:36:57,516
great content.


1432
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,216
Remember notifications are about


1433
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:00,766
making human connections and


1434
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:01,736
conversation.


1435
00:37:02,926 --> 00:37:04,276
They're also about delivering


1436
00:37:04,326 --> 00:37:05,586
valuable information.


1437
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:09,686
Consider delivery.


1438
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,986
Consider providing ways for


1439
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:14,016
people to customizing


1440
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:15,786
notifications and incorporate


1441
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:17,206
things like time and location


1442
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,726
when sending them.


1443
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:21,096
Okay, notification grouping.


1444
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:25,666
So, iOS and WatchOS will group


1445
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,756
notifications by app by default.


1446
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:28,986
And most of the time, that


1447
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,086
should be totally okay.


1448
00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:32,316
But consider threading related


1449
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,546
content to have discrete


1450
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:34,616
meaningful groupings.


1451
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:36,426
People are really excited about


1452
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:36,746
this one.


1453
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,726
Okay, rich notifications.


1454
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,136
Consider creating rich education


1455
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,566
so people can accomplish more


1456
00:37:45,826 --> 00:37:46,506
right in the moment.


1457
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:50,796
And last, but not least,


1458
00:37:52,516 --> 00:37:54,126
consider notifications on both


1459
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:54,686
devices.


1460
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,056
You'll be providing a great


1461
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,786
experience in any circumstance.


1462
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:01,316
So, the next time people hear


1463
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:03,996
this sound [ding], people will


1464
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:05,496
be delighted because you value


1465
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:06,816
their attention, and sent them


1466
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:07,686
something really great.


1467
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:08,976
Thank you guys.
