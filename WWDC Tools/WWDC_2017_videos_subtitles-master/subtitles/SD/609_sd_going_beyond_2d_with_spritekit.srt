1
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:24,556
>> Morning everyone.


2
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:29,546
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:30,476
I'm Ross Dexter.


4
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:31,186
I'm an engineer on the Games


5
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:32,176
Technologies Team at Apple.


6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,196
And I'd like to welcome you to


7
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,096
going beyond 2D with SpriteKit.


8
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:38,386
So before we dive in I'd like to


9
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,596
quickly talk about what


10
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:41,056
SpriteKit is and where it fits


11
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,196
in the Apple rendering picture.


12
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,486
SpriteKit is Apple's 2D graphics


13
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:45,606
framework for games.


14
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:46,486
And it's designed to be


15
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:48,826
flexible, fast, and easy to use.


16
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,456
It's supported across all of our


17
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:51,926
platforms and has an Xcode


18
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,486
integrated life editor to make


19
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,896
lying out and previewing your


20
00:00:54,896 --> 00:00:56,616
game content quick and easy.


21
00:00:58,106 --> 00:00:59,876
SpriteKit sits along SceneKit or


22
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,326
other games oriented graphics


23
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:02,836
framework and both sit on top of


24
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:03,136
Metal.


25
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:04,796
Traditionally they've all been


26
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:06,156
used separately in different


27
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:06,896
contexts.


28
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:09,446
SpriteKit for quick and easy 2D,


29
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:10,956
SceneKit as all ready to use 3D


30
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:12,756
engine, and Metal to give you


31
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,236
direct access to your devices


32
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,116
rendering hardware.


33
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:16,926
Instead of keeping all three


34
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,766
separate we think it's time that


35
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,146
SpriteKit breaks out of its 2D


36
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:20,476
mold.


37
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:22,736
SpriteKit has a great deal to


38
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:23,776
offer to make using it in


39
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:24,986
combination with SceneKit and


40
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:25,836
Metal attractive.


41
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,626
Since they both use Metal under


42
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:28,846
the hood, it should be trivial


43
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:30,446
to render SpriteKit content in


44
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:32,866
SceneKit or be able to pipe it


45
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:34,396
back into Metal use however you


46
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:34,806
wish.


47
00:01:36,046 --> 00:01:37,116
Lots of 3D games and apps


48
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:38,916
feature 2D content and SpriteKit


49
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,036
provides the perfects means for


50
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:41,036
creating and rendering that


51
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:41,476
content.


52
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:45,756
On top of that this year Apple


53
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:47,216
is introducing ARKit, which


54
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:48,136
takes all the hard work out of


55
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:49,576
creating augmented reality apps.


56
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,006
The addition of this new


57
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:52,296
framework provides one more


58
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,096
reason why it's time for


59
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:55,336
SpriteKit to go beyond 2D and


60
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:56,316
into the third dimension.


61
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:57,696
And today we're going to show


62
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:59,386
you how to do it and what you


63
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:02,916
can achieve.


64
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:04,526
In this session we're going to


65
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:05,886
cover how to render SpriteKit


66
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:07,616
content in ARKit, bringing


67
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:08,406
SpriteKit to the world of


68
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:09,186
augmented reality.


69
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,236
Next, we'll show you how to get


70
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,406
your SpriteKit scenes into


71
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:13,946
SceneKit and how that can


72
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:15,096
improve your augmented reality


73
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:15,556
apps.


74
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:17,376
And then finally we'll introduce


75
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:18,986
you to SKRenderer, which allows


76
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:20,206
you to take more control of how


77
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,966
SpriteKit updates and renders.


78
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:25,116
All right, let's dive right in


79
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:26,726
with how you can use SpriteKit


80
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:27,726
and ARKit together.


81
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:30,826
But first we should talk about


82
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:31,976
what augmented reality actually


83
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:36,486
is. Augmented reality combines a


84
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,046
real world view with computer


85
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:38,856
rendered content.


86
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:40,586
That content gets attached to


87
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,326
locations in the real world so


88
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:43,836
that as you move your device and


89
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:45,336
the view shifts, the content


90
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:46,696
appears to remain in place.


91
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:49,606
That allows you to inspect the


92
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:51,546
content from different angels as


93
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,796
if it were a physical object in


94
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:53,976
front of your device.


95
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:55,816
And this requires a lot of


96
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,226
complex tracking and is a real


97
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,866
challenge to implement.


98
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,316
Thankfully ARKit does all the


99
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,136
hard work for you.


100
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,426
When you use ARKit it leverages


101
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:07,276
your devices camera,


102
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:09,446
accelerometer and other hardware


103
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,326
to track its position and


104
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,186
orientation in the real world.


105
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:14,826
All you have to do is provide it


106
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:15,896
the content you want to appear


107
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,906
in AR, and ARKit automatically


108
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,316
updates the relative positioning


109
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:20,646
of your content as your device


110
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:21,066
moves.


111
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:23,076
If you like a deeper dive into


112
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:24,386
exactly how this all works, I


113
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:25,356
highly recommend checking out


114
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,856
the Introducing ARKit session


115
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:27,886
that happened earlier this week.


116
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:31,796
ARKit is able to track and


117
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:32,686
update the position of your


118
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:33,916
content through the use of


119
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:34,556
anchors.


120
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:35,906
They are what make AR work.


121
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,306
Anchors are 3D points that


122
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,596
correspond to real world


123
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,076
features that ARKit detects


124
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,426
through Scene and understanding,


125
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,356
which uses your devices camera


126
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:47,456
to perceive and process the


127
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:48,526
world around you.


128
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:50,616
Anchors are easy to create.


129
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,606
You can request ARKit to detect


130
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,036
one at anytime through the API.


131
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,696
Or you can create one manually


132
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:57,176
using your devices position and


133
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:57,756
orientation.


134
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:01,646
So how do we get ARKit working


135
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:02,506
with SpriteKit content?


136
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,586
ARKit is designed to interact


137
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:06,576
directly with SpriteKit.


138
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:08,476
ARKit will ask that your -- ask


139
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:09,896
your first SpriteKit nodes is


140
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,336
attached to anchors and then


141
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,526
will automatically position,


142
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,736
rotate, and scale those nodes as


143
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:15,556
the device moves.


144
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,946
It does this so your SpriteKit


145
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,536
content will stay aligned with


146
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:20,805
the anchors giving the


147
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,236
appearance that your content is


148
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:23,346
rooted in the real world.


149
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,596
Sprites are rendered so they are


150
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:26,806
always facing the camera.


151
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,016
So no matter what angle you view


152
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,246
them from they're always facing


153
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:30,656
the camera.


154
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:32,556
This is a technique known as


155
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:33,576
billboarding and it's commonly


156
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,766
used in early 3D games.


157
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,526
So you may not be familiar with


158
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:38,726
how billboarding works, so let's


159
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:40,356
go over a few quick examples of


160
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:41,676
how you can use it, it lets you


161
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,166
use 2D content in 3D space.


162
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:45,746
So say we have sprite position


163
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:47,186
in 3D space and a camera


164
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:47,686
observing it.


165
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:50,316
As the camera moves closer to


166
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,446
the sprite the sprite grows


167
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:53,006
larger as you'd expect taking


168
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:53,536
more of the view.


169
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,516
As the camera moves further


170
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,856
away, the sprite shrinks.


171
00:04:58,876 --> 00:04:59,906
Now I'll rotate the camera.


172
00:05:00,576 --> 00:05:03,286
As the camera changes its point


173
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:04,596
of view, the sprite continues to


174
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,986
face the camera at all times.


175
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,616
And this should be the case from


176
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,576
any angle we view it from.


177
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:10,896
Let's add another sprite to our


178
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:11,956
3D scene here to show how this


179
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,686
works with multiple 2D objects.


180
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:17,136
Sprites that are further away


181
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,706
are rendered behind sprites that


182
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:19,516
are closer to the camera.


183
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,616
As the camera moves the more


184
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,616
distant sprite comes into view.


185
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:27,586
Both sprites always face the


186
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:31,446
camera and this simple technique


187
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,166
allows your 2D sprite content to


188
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,466
work in a 3D spaces.


189
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:38,566
So now that we've shown you how


190
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:39,956
ARKit and SpriteKit work


191
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:41,916
together at a conceptual level,


192
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,176
let's talk about the actual


193
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,226
objects you'll need to implement


194
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,186
your app.


195
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,286
To work with ARKit and SpriteKit


196
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,566
there are four important objects


197
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:49,246
for you to know about --


198
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,956
ARSession, ARAnchor, ARSKView,


199
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:54,146
and ARSKViewDelegate.


200
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:59,096
ARSession is the heart of ARKit.


201
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:00,636
It handles all the device


202
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:02,426
tracking and orchestrates the


203
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:03,856
interactions between ARKit and


204
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:04,336
SpriteKit.


205
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:06,696
It has methods for adding and


206
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,446
removing anchors that you create


207
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:08,866
in your app.


208
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,846
To get started up, you just call


209
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,086
the Run method and ARSession


210
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:13,496
will began tracking your device.


211
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,376
You just need to provide it an


212
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,966
ARSession Configuration which


213
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,186
tells the ARKit which AR


214
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:20,586
techniques it should use.


215
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,136
So in working with SpriteKit you


216
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,396
should just use the AR World


217
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:24,836
Tracking Session Configuration,


218
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:25,626
which enables all the


219
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:27,076
functionality you'll need from


220
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:27,576
ARKit.


221
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:31,546
ARKit defines real-world


222
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:33,026
features through ARAnchor.


223
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:34,626
It represents a position in the


224
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:35,716
real world and contains


225
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:36,786
transform data as well as a


226
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:37,626
unique identifier.


227
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,596
ARKit maps ARAnchors to the


228
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:42,186
SKNodes that we provided to


229
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:45,586
render our contents.


230
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,136
ARKit interacts with SpriteKit


231
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:48,926
through ARSKView, which is


232
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,126
derived from SKView.


233
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,026
It creates and contains the


234
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:53,346
ARSession so you don't need to


235
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,206
create it manually.


236
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,386
And it has methods for getting


237
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:56,656
related anchors and nodes.


238
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:58,066
So you need to manually track


239
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,706
which node corresponds to what


240
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:00,996
anchor and vise versa.


241
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,086
It also has a hitTest method,


242
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:04,936
which is your primary way of


243
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:05,866
creating anchors.


244
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:07,246
It takes a point on your devices


245
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:08,736
screen and shoots a ray through


246
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:08,916
it.


247
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,366
So looking for the nearest point


248
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,686
in the real world for you to


249
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,096
attach stuff to.


250
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:16,286
Finally, there's


251
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,686
ARSKViewDelegate.


252
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:18,966
A protocol derived from


253
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,916
SKViewDelegate, which helps you


254
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,126
react to anchors being added,


255
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,766
updated, and removed from the


256
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:24,196
session.


257
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,566
All of its methods are optional


258
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,596
and they're the key to using


259
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,156
SpriteKit and ARKit together.


260
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:32,166
But we'll come back to that in a


261
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:32,936
bit.


262
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:34,256
Let's get started on creating


263
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:36,016
our first ARKit app with


264
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:36,476
SpriteKit.


265
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,066
First we'll create a new iOS


266
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,576
project in Xcode.


267
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:42,416
You'll see that in Xcode 9,


268
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,716
there's a new augmented reality


269
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:47,366
app template for you to choose.


270
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:49,026
Once you choose the app template


271
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,616
to get started with SpriteKit


272
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:51,676
select it as your content


273
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:52,256
technology.


274
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:56,146
And that's all there is to it.


275
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:57,496
You're now ready to enter


276
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:58,306
augmented reality.


277
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,586
The resulting project looks


278
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,056
pretty standard for an iOS app,


279
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,316
but let's go through the files


280
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,006
that are important to using


281
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:05,356
SpriteKit and ARKit together.


282
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:09,016
First there's Scene.sks.


283
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,036
This is a standard SpriteKit


284
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,276
scene and it's where you create


285
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:13,736
and layout any non-AR content


286
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,596
that you want to appear in your


287
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:14,826
app.


288
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,106
It will act like an overlay for


289
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:17,976
the AR content.


290
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:18,846
And so it's useful for things


291
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,346
like HUD elements, help text,


292
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,086
stuff like that.


293
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:23,466
Nodes that have a Z position


294
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,836
greater than or equal to 0 will


295
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,766
draw over any AR content that


296
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,226
ARKit adds to the scene.


297
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,666
All nodes are managed by -- that


298
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,996
are managed by ARKit have Z


299
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,606
positions that are less than 0.


300
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,706
Next, Scene.swift.


301
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,686
This is a SpriteKit scene's


302
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:40,905
corresponding source file.


303
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,686
As with normal SpriteKit apps,


304
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:44,386
this is where you put code to


305
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,236
manage your scene and Gameplay


306
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,386
and logic and is a good place to


307
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:48,876
leverage gameplay kits various


308
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:49,306
features.


309
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:53,006
And finally we have


310
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:54,306
ViewController.swift.


311
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,206
The view controller conforms to


312
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,096
ARSKViewDelegate and its


313
00:08:58,096 --> 00:08:59,206
sceneView property is an


314
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,906
instance of ARSKView, which


315
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,206
contains the ARSession.


316
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,586
The view controller class is


317
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,456
your primary means of


318
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:06,686
interacting with ARKit.


319
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:08,436
In the template it's


320
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:10,256
automatically set up to call run


321
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,996
on ARSession with an AR World


322
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:13,366
Tracking Session Configuration.


323
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:14,496
So you don't need to add it


324
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:15,006
yourself.


325
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:16,926
This is also where you implement


326
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:18,216
the ARSKView Delegate Methods


327
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,366
that are relevant to you.


328
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:23,406
Now let's talk about the ARKit


329
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,996
Events that the view controller


330
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:25,876
would need to react to.


331
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,546
The first event is when a new


332
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,516
anchor gets added to SKSession.


333
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,516
When this happens ARKit will ask


334
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:34,516
the view controller for the


335
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:35,586
SpriteKit nodes you want to


336
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:37,096
associate with an anchor.


337
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:39,436
So this is when we create our AR


338
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:39,856
content.


339
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:42,906
The second event is when an


340
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,876
existing anchor is updated by


341
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,396
the session.


342
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:47,836
When this occurs ARKit informs a


343
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,796
view controller so you can react


344
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:50,336
to the update.


345
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:52,926
And the third and final event is


346
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,416
when an anchor is removed from


347
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:54,886
the session.


348
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,336
ARKit tells the view controller


349
00:09:57,336 --> 00:09:58,526
so you can form any necessary


350
00:09:58,526 --> 00:09:59,696
cleanup in your app.


351
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:04,896
ARSKViewDelegate provides


352
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,016
methods tied to each of these


353
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:06,476
events.


354
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:08,596
As we mentioned, each of these


355
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:10,676
methods is optional so you only


356
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,786
need to implement the ones that


357
00:10:11,786 --> 00:10:12,366
matter to you.


358
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,076
Let's go over each one.


359
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:18,746
First is the node for anchor


360
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:19,136
method.


361
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,126
This gets called when a new


362
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,426
anchor is added to the session.


363
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:24,636
An ARKit maps that node return


364
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:26,656
from this method to the anchor


365
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:27,396
that's passed in.


366
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,286
You should implement this if you


367
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,946
want to create a custom node for


368
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:31,386
an anchor.


369
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,266
If you don't implement the


370
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,446
method a default empty SKNode is


371
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:36,706
created for you automatically.


372
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:39,196
The node that gets returned from


373
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:40,226
this method will be moved,


374
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,576
rotated, and scaled by ARKit to


375
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,756
match its anchor.


376
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:45,116
So if you try and make any


377
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,676
changes to the transform they'll


378
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,016
likely be overwritten by ARKit


379
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,166
when the device moves.


380
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:50,946
It's useful to know that any


381
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:51,976
children that are assigned to


382
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,006
this node won't have their


383
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:53,946
transforms modified.


384
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,486
But we'll talk more about this


385
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:56,286
with our next method.


386
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,036
Also know that ARKit


387
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:00,336
automatically adds this node to


388
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:02,046
the scene graph so you don't


389
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,336
have to.


390
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,376
Next, we have didAdd node for


391
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:06,686
anchor.


392
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:09,076
This is called after an SKNode


393
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:10,436
is mapped to an anchor, so after


394
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,916
the previous node for anchor


395
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,336
method is executed.


396
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:15,896
If you implemented the node for


397
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:17,256
anchor method, the node that


398
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:18,616
gets passed in here will be the


399
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,126
one you returned from there.


400
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:22,026
If you didn't implement it, it


401
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,286
will be a default empty node.


402
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:25,656
As we mentioned in the previous


403
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:27,176
slide the node that's mapped to


404
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:28,166
the anchor has it transformed


405
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,086
modified ARKit to follow the


406
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,396
anchor as the device moves.


407
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:33,686
As such, if you want to modify


408
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,986
the transforms of your content,


409
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,326
you should add them as children


410
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:39,116
in here as ARKit won't modify


411
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:41,716
them.


412
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,446
Next, we'll update node for


413
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:44,866
anchor and didUpdate node for


414
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:45,166
anchor.


415
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,366
These methods are called before


416
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,846
and after the node is updated


417
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:49,946
with a given anchors data.


418
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:52,316
True to their names willUpdate


419
00:11:52,316 --> 00:11:53,426
node for anchor is called before


420
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:55,016
the update, and didUpdate node


421
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,116
for anchor is called after the


422
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:56,486
update.


423
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,246
This occurs when the device


424
00:11:58,246 --> 00:11:59,736
moves and the view changes.


425
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:01,996
The nodes position, rotation,


426
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,046
and or scale is subject to


427
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,556
change between calls to these


428
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:04,916
methods.


429
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:09,986
Finally, didRemove node for


430
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:10,326
anchor.


431
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,316
This gets called the node is


432
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,496
removed from the scene graph,


433
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:15,496
which occurs when its course on


434
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:16,796
the anchor is removed from


435
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:17,336
ARSession.


436
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:19,826
All right, that covers the


437
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,336
important parts of the API.


438
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,766
Let's take a look at some code.


439
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:24,826
So let's cover creating an


440
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:25,186
anchor.


441
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:27,206
Here we're looking at a handler


442
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,286
for the touches began event.


443
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:33,216
When the device reports a touch,


444
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,516
we get the location of the touch


445
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:35,936
in our ARSKView.


446
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:39,946
We then provide the touch


447
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:42,556
location to the ARSKView's hit


448
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:44,376
test method, which shoots a ray


449
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,896
out into the real world looking


450
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,126
for feature points that we can


451
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:48,346
turn into anchors.


452
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:50,626
It returns an array of all the


453
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,316
hits that it registers sorted


454
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:53,686
from nearest to furthest.


455
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:58,626
We take the nearest hit and we


456
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,006
use this world transform to


457
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,056
create and ARAnchor, which we


458
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:02,896
then add to the session.


459
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,606
And that's all there is to it.


460
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:06,786
Creating anchors could not be


461
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,186
simpler.


462
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:12,246
So now that we've added a new


463
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:13,506
anchor to the session, the


464
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,436
session will ask the view


465
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:15,606
controller for the SpriteKit


466
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:16,616
content that we want to attach


467
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:17,726
to it.


468
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:21,386
To do this we've implemented


469
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,996
ARSKView Delegates didAdd node


470
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:23,766
for anchor method.


471
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:26,066
We haven't implemented node for


472
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,556
anchor, so default empty node


473
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,746
was created for us.


474
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:29,686
And that's [inaudible] of this


475
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:30,606
method.


476
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:34,476
So now all we need to do is


477
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:35,426
create the content we want to


478
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:37,756
attach to the anchor and then


479
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,546
add it as a child of the node


480
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:41,586
that's passed into this method.


481
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,846
ARKit will automatically update


482
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,236
the node so that it will follow


483
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:46,586
the anchor as the device moves


484
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:47,816
so you don't need to do anything


485
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:48,186
else.


486
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:52,146
So now that we've shown you


487
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:53,816
exactly how to use the ARKit API


488
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,196
with SpriteKit, let's enter


489
00:13:55,196 --> 00:13:57,266
augmented reality.


490
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:07,546
[ Applause ]


491
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,936
Let's open our app here.


492
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:12,446
So we see we're doing our video


493
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:13,266
pass through now.


494
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,196
We can see our lovely audience


495
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:15,656
out there.


496
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,046
You're all famous now.


497
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,456
So let's start placing some


498
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:20,956
content in augmented reality.


499
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,786
As I tap on my screen I'm


500
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:28,276
placing content half a meter out


501
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:29,196
in front of me.


502
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:30,636
Here I'm just placing


503
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,856
SKLabelNode's with Emoji.


504
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,896
Fun fact -- you can use emoji in


505
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:35,786
your SpriteKit apps by just


506
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:36,446
using labels.


507
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,416
Just paste them in there.


508
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,446
And you see they have them


509
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:40,886
floating in 3D space.


510
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,786
And as I move the camera around


511
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,796
they move relative to one


512
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:47,136
another.


513
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:50,196
Just placing them in space is a


514
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:50,936
little boring.


515
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:52,926
I can also place them on a


516
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:53,506
surface.


517
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:57,426
And it will detect intersection


518
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:59,756
with the surface with the


519
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:00,656
HitTest method that we were


520
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:01,566
talking about before.


521
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:06,276
And then it places the emoji on


522
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:07,526
the surface of the table that


523
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:08,026
it's detected.


524
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,636
But placing emoji is just a


525
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:11,786
little boring.


526
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:13,296
So now we're going to switch


527
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:16,676
into blasting mode and then we


528
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:18,636
can blow up our emoji, which is


529
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,296
a little bit more fun.


530
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:23,546
Also pay attention to the text


531
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,216
in our -- in the lower left hand


532
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,786
corner here and the way that our


533
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:31,146
emoji are flipping around when


534
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,646
we destroy them, because that's


535
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:33,816
going to become relevant in a


536
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:34,166
moment.


537
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:37,256
So you see how easy it is to


538
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:41,156
quickly create an app and use a


539
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,346
SpriteKit content to enter


540
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:44,056
augmented realty.


541
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:45,386
This is just a slightly tweaked


542
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:47,736
version of the template app that


543
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,416
you can create right now using


544
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,066
Xcode 9.


545
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:53,526
And that's SpriteKit with ARKit.


546
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:58,696
[ Applause ]


547
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:00,316
So you see how easy it is to


548
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:01,316
enter augmented reality when


549
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:02,546
using ARKit and SpriteKit


550
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:02,936
together.


551
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:04,816
As I mentioned there are a few


552
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,016
other SpriteKit features in


553
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:06,946
there, some of which that were


554
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:07,926
present in the demo that I'd


555
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,716
like to quickly cover.


556
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,996
So hopefully you notice the text


557
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:13,156
on the bottom of our screen in


558
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:14,316
the demo app animating.


559
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:15,936
This was done with a single


560
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:17,306
SKLabelNode, thanks to the fact


561
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,586
that they now support attributed


562
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:19,026
strings.


563
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,096
Attributed strings allows you to


564
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,376
specify the attributes of each


565
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:25,026
character in a string, letting


566
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,206
you mix things like different


567
00:16:26,206 --> 00:16:27,946
colors and fonts in the same


568
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:28,326
label.


569
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,856
It uses NSAAttributedString and


570
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,976
all you have to do is set it on


571
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:34,226
SKLabelNodes new attributedText


572
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:34,666
property.


573
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,816
The emoji in our augmented


574
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,026
reality apps spun about in ways


575
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:41,276
that weren't possible until now


576
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:42,316
thanks to the new


577
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,096
SKTransformNode.


578
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,886
SKNode already had z rotation,


579
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,176
but SKTransformNode adds the


580
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,436
ability for you to rotate around


581
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:52,326
the x and y-axis as well.


582
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,646
Aligned for full 3D rotations


583
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,706
for SpriteKit content.


584
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,116
And these rotations apply to all


585
00:16:58,116 --> 00:16:59,006
child nodes as well.


586
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,736
SKTransformNode uses


587
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:02,956
orthographic projection.


588
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,205
So it doesn't apply any


589
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,316
perspective skewing to your


590
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:05,846
nodes.


591
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:08,156
You can specify your rotations


592
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:10,106
through the x, y, and z rotation


593
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:11,705
properties or you can use a


594
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:12,866
specialized getters and setters


595
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,606
for Euler angles, rotation


596
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:18,185
matrices, and quaternions.


597
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:19,636
Finally, on the ender side of


598
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:20,856
things, SpriteKit is fully


599
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,766
compatible with Xcode's View


600
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:23,205
Debugger.


601
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,415
It displays the entire scene


602
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,796
graph and gives you the neat


603
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,476
exploded 3D view of your scene,


604
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:29,926
which can be a great help when


605
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:31,676
you're trying to debug layout --


606
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,176
content layout issues.


607
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,726
It also allows you to inspect


608
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:35,946
all of your node properties so


609
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:37,096
you can see the state of


610
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,026
everything in your scene as the


611
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:39,216
moment the app was paused.


612
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:40,836
This is a really great new


613
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:41,816
feature, so please check out the


614
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:43,136
debugging with Xcode 9 session


615
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,726
for more information on it.


616
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,116
We've shown you how quick and


617
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,976
easy it is to get started with


618
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,736
using ARKit and SpriteKit to


619
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,256
create an augmented reality app.


620
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,586
ARKit handles all of the hard


621
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:56,916
parts of augmented reality for


622
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,636
you and SpriteKit makes


623
00:17:58,636 --> 00:17:59,916
rendering content a snap.


624
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:02,396
We've also introduced new


625
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:03,566
features to SpriteKit that give


626
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:04,716
you greater flexibility in


627
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:05,906
developing your apps and give


628
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:07,206
you new options for debugging


629
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:08,036
SpriteKit content.


630
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:12,116
But you may have a few lingering


631
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:12,786
questions.


632
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:14,036
What if we don't want


633
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:15,066
billboarded sprites?


634
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,736
What if we want our SpriteKit


635
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:17,636
content to be effective by


636
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:18,156
perspective?


637
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,886
What if we want to mix 2D and 3D


638
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:23,596
content in augmented reality?


639
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,236
What if wanted to take SpriteKit


640
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:27,216
further into 3D?


641
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:31,186
The answer lies in combining


642
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:33,236
SceneKit, SpriteKit, and ARKit


643
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:36,206
all at once.


644
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,286
SceneKit and SpriteKit's 3D


645
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,046
counterpart, it's a ready to use


646
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,626
3D engine with it's own Xcode


647
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:42,866
integrated live editor.


648
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:44,956
What you may not know is that


649
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,576
you can use SpriteKit Scenes as


650
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,296
the material on geometry in


651
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:49,876
SceneKit.


652
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,556
That allows you to render


653
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:53,326
SpriteKit content with complex


654
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:54,936
3D transforms and perspective


655
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:55,276
effect.


656
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:57,726
Additionally you can easily mix


657
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:59,506
2D SpriteKit content with 3D


658
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:04,176
SceneKit content in the same


659
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:04,506
context.


660
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,326
Like SpriteKit, SceneKit is also


661
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:08,476
integrated with ARKit, creating


662
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:10,456
a project that uses SceneKit in


663
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,286
an augmented reality app is the


664
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,346
same as with SpriteKit.


665
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:15,376
Just change the content


666
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:16,696
technology to SceneKit.


667
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:21,386
The API is designed to be very


668
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,436
similar to the one you use with


669
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:22,906
SpriteKit.


670
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,836
Only the names of few objects


671
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,496
are different.


672
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:30,226
ARSKView becomes ARSCNView and


673
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:31,726
ARSKViewDelegate becomes


674
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:32,936
ARSCNViewDelegate.


675
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:34,866
As with SpriteKit the template


676
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:37,026
creates ARSCNView for you and


677
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,606
the ViewController conforms to


678
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:39,636
ARSCNViewDelegate.


679
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:41,596
Now in the interest in brevity


680
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:42,456
and because the API is so


681
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:43,416
similar, we won't bother


682
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,186
covering the rest here.


683
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:48,356
So next we want to get out


684
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:49,596
SpriteKit content rendering


685
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,656
within a SceneKit scene.


686
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:53,226
Normally with SpriteKit you have


687
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,816
your scene and you set it on an


688
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:55,296
SKView.


689
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:58,406
SKView then works with UIKit or


690
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,386
AppKit on Mac OS to get your


691
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:03,236
content on screen.


692
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:04,886
To get your content rendering in


693
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,336
SceneKit things are handled a


694
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,076
little differently.


695
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:08,856
Instead of setting your scene on


696
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,406
the view, you set it on the


697
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:11,986
material property of the


698
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,056
geometry on which you want the


699
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:14,906
SpriteKit content to appear.


700
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:17,336
And then that material works


701
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:18,786
with SceneKit to render you


702
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,346
SpriteKit content and then


703
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:22,026
texture map it onto the geometry


704
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:23,276
the material is associated with.


705
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:27,566
So let's go over a few examples


706
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,086
of rendering SpriteKit content


707
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:30,426
on SceneKit Geometry.


708
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,856
Here was have a basic SpriteKit


709
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:33,226
scene.


710
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:35,866
And here's what we get when we


711
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,426
render that on a scene on a


712
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:39,226
plane in scene kit.


713
00:20:40,996 --> 00:20:42,606
We also apply the SpriteKit's


714
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,366
scene to a cube or even a


715
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:45,766
sphere.


716
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:47,286
You can use it just like a


717
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:48,756
regular texture and the


718
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:49,906
SpriteKit -- as the SpriteKit


719
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:51,416
scene updates, your texture will


720
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,906
be updated along with it.


721
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,226
So now I'd like to quickly show


722
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:57,476
you how easy it is to use


723
00:20:57,476 --> 00:20:58,856
SpriteKit with SceneKit.


724
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,056
First, get the SpriteKit scene


725
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:04,316
that you want to use in


726
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:04,766
SceneKit.


727
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:08,766
Next, create the geometry you


728
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:09,856
want the SpriteKit scene to be


729
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:10,356
rendered on.


730
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,246
Here we're creating a simple


731
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:12,686
plane.


732
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,466
Then you just need to set the


733
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:17,996
SpriteKit scene as the contents


734
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:19,556
of the diffuse property of the


735
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:20,386
planes material.


736
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:22,726
That will cause the SceneKit to


737
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:23,766
render the SpriteKit Scene to a


738
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:25,496
texture and then apply it to the


739
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:25,996
geometry.


740
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:30,686
Here we're setting the material


741
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:31,796
to be double-sided.


742
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:33,416
This causes the SpriteKit Scene


743
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,756
to appear on both sides of the


744
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:35,156
plane.


745
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:38,826
Then we just need to create a


746
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,196
SceneKit node for the plane and


747
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:44,146
add it to the SceneKit scene.


748
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:45,606
Now the plane will show up in


749
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:46,716
the scene with the contents of


750
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:48,156
your SpriteKit scene texture


751
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:49,746
mapped onto it.


752
00:21:51,236 --> 00:21:53,176
So now I'd like to show you demo


753
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:54,226
of some of the things you can do


754
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,256
when you use SpriteKit and


755
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:56,746
SceneKit together with ARKit.


756
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:08,036
[ Applause ]


757
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:08,926
All right.


758
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:13,476
So here I have a demo that I've


759
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:16,546
built on top of the sample code


760
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:18,036
that ARKit has released, that


761
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,286
you can find to their session


762
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:19,766
website.


763
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:23,006
And here I just is detecting a


764
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:23,896
plane for us.


765
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:27,116
Now if I tap on the screen it


766
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:29,696
places a SpriteKit scene for us


767
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:30,416
in the world here.


768
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:32,666
And you see that this a fully


769
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,166
live SpriteKit scene.


770
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,926
You see the trees are animating.


771
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:38,936
And in fact I can actually


772
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:40,286
interact with this directly.


773
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,796
Well, here let's actually --


774
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:44,346
let's blow it up a little bit.


775
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:45,756
Since we are in 3D we can do all


776
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:46,536
kinds of cool things.


777
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,316
We can move this guy around, we


778
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:51,286
can rotate, and we can scale,


779
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,216
make it a little bigger.


780
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:55,786
So now I can actually interact


781
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:56,726
with this scene directly.


782
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:58,686
I have controls on my device


783
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:00,986
here, I can move my character


784
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:03,166
around, you can jump around.


785
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,336
Hard to get over that thing.


786
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:07,816
Yeah. And so we can jump around


787
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:09,576
in real time, interact with this


788
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:10,716
just like a normal SpriteKit


789
00:23:10,716 --> 00:23:12,996
scene rendered in 3D.


790
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:15,236
But just having it sit here on


791
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:16,886
the surface is a little boring.


792
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:17,986
We should do something a little


793
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,076
more interesting, it a little


794
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:19,936
more 3D.


795
00:23:20,336 --> 00:23:21,466
So if I actually touch this


796
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,046
button up here, the scene flips


797
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:26,396
up and --


798
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:30,576
[ Applause ]


799
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,946
If I touch it again it separates


800
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:34,146
the different layers that I have


801
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:34,436
in here.


802
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:35,566
So we don't actually have just


803
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:36,706
one SpriteKit scene --


804
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,546
[ Applause ]


805
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:41,706
We actually have three


806
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:42,706
SpriteKit's scenes here, one for


807
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:43,276
each layer here.


808
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,866
One for the middle -- front,


809
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:46,136
middle, and background.


810
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:49,436
So this shows you the kind of


811
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:50,546
stuff that you can do when you


812
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:51,756
use SpriteKit and SceneKit


813
00:23:51,756 --> 00:23:54,346
together with ARKit but maybe


814
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:55,366
you start to feel a little


815
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:58,336
constrained by the level here.


816
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,356
And maybe we want to have our


817
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,176
little guy go out on an


818
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:02,946
adventure on his own.


819
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:03,906
He can run out into the real


820
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:04,386
world here.


821
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,576
Oh this button looks kind of


822
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:07,056
tempting.


823
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:11,216
Yay.


824
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:18,556
[ Applause ]


825
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:19,826
So that gives you an idea of


826
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:20,736
what you can do when you use


827
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,606
SpriteKit in a 3D context with


828
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,586
SceneKit together with ARKit.


829
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:28,946
So as you saw using SpriteKit


830
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:30,156
with SceneKit allows for full 3D


831
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:31,456
transforms and perspective,


832
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:32,436
which allows you to do some


833
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,216
pretty neat things.


834
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:35,376
It allows you to mix 2D and 3D


835
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:36,926
content within the same context


836
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:38,926
and it's fully compatible with


837
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:41,116
the ARKit and it works great in


838
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:42,286
general 3D apps as well.


839
00:24:42,286 --> 00:24:46,556
So now that we've covered how to


840
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:48,176
work with ARKit and SceneKit, I


841
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:49,106
would like to introduce you to a


842
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:50,646
another new SpriteKit feature --


843
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:51,976
SKRenderer.


844
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:56,056
Let's talk a bit about how


845
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:57,496
SpriteKit works under the hood.


846
00:24:58,376 --> 00:24:59,006
As we've mentioned in the


847
00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:00,796
previous section, with normal


848
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:02,046
SpriteKit Rendering you have


849
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:03,616
your scene and you set it on an


850
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:05,566
SKView, which then works with


851
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,736
UIKit and AppKit to get your


852
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:09,046
content on the screen.


853
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:11,346
SKView handles all of the


854
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:12,826
updating and rendering for you.


855
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:14,796
The upside of this is that it


856
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:15,906
makes it very easy to get


857
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:16,826
started with SpriteKit.


858
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:18,666
But what if you want to render


859
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,256
SpriteKit content in a 3D


860
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:20,776
context?


861
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:24,276
One solution as we showed you is


862
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,306
to use SpriteKit with SceneKit.


863
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:28,356
Instead of setting your scene on


864
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:29,586
the view, you use it as a


865
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,056
material in SceneKit.


866
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,006
And this let's you do all kinds


867
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:33,616
of cool stuff.


868
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,976
But when SpriteKit updates and


869
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:37,226
renders is still out of your


870
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:37,796
hands.


871
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,896
What if you want more control?


872
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:42,416
Maybe you want to update with


873
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,396
exact fixed time steps or update


874
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:46,756
without rendering or render


875
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:48,866
without updating or update once


876
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:50,346
and render twice, each time from


877
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:51,076
a different viewpoint.


878
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:53,596
What if we wanted to work


879
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:56,186
directly with Metal?


880
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,676
Enter SKRenderer.


881
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,026
You use it instead of SKView to


882
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,196
gain more control over


883
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:03,866
SpriteKit.


884
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:07,986
Like SKView, to use it you just


885
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:09,926
set it your scene -- you set


886
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:10,876
your scene on it on the


887
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:11,236
renderer.


888
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,196
Unlike SKView however,


889
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:15,026
SKRenderer let's you determine


890
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:16,586
when SpriteKit performs updating


891
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:17,176
and rendering.


892
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,326
It allows you to work directly


893
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:20,956
with Metal and then you can do


894
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:22,326
things like render SpriteKit


895
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:23,436
into an off screen texture to


896
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:24,526
use however you want.


897
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:26,956
This by the way is how SceneKit


898
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,596
is able to efficiently render


899
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,356
SpriteKit content in 3D.


900
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:32,396
It uses SKRenderer under the


901
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,086
hood.


902
00:26:34,716 --> 00:26:36,486
There are four stages to using


903
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:38,666
SKRenderer -- initialization,


904
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:41,756
setting the scene, updating, and


905
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:42,116
rendering.


906
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:44,616
Initialization occurs once.


907
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:46,406
You set your scene at the start


908
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:47,516
and again we want the transition


909
00:26:47,516 --> 00:26:49,666
to a new scene and update and


910
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,386
renderer repeat every frame in


911
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:51,626
your app.


912
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,846
Let's look at some code for each


913
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:57,416
of these stages.


914
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:59,206
Stage one Initialization.


915
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,796
To initialize SKRenderer, all


916
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:02,716
you need to do is provide it


917
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:05,906
with a Metal device.


918
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:08,656
Stage Two, setting the scene.


919
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:10,556
This works exactly the same as


920
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,076
with SKView, just that your


921
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:13,726
scene on SKRenderer's scene


922
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:14,116
property.


923
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,866
Stage Three, updating.


924
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,096
Also very simple, all you need


925
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,386
to do is pass in the current


926
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:25,286
time.


927
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,166
Stage four, rendering.


928
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,676
This is done by calling the


929
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:29,786
render method of which there are


930
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:30,516
two flavors.


931
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:32,286
Which one you want to use is


932
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:33,446
situational, depending on how


933
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:34,776
you want to use your SpriteKit


934
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:35,816
content with Metal.


935
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:39,346
Both methods ask you to specify


936
00:27:39,376 --> 00:27:40,466
your viewport you like to render


937
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:42,106
into, which is just the CGrect


938
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:43,076
that defines the area of


939
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:45,026
SpriteKit will draw into in the


940
00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:48,456
render target.


941
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:50,886
And they both take a Metal


942
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:51,986
render pass descriptor, which


943
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:53,266
describes that render target


944
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,476
that you want the SpriteKit


945
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:58,616
content to draw into.


946
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,246
Now the first method allows you


947
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:01,986
to specify the command buffer to


948
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:03,346
which SpriteKit will schedule


949
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:04,376
rendering commands.


950
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:06,436
A good case in which to call


951
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,366
this method is if you're not


952
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:08,956
directly mixing SpriteKit


953
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,726
content with other Metal content


954
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:11,966
in the same render target.


955
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:13,646
If you want to render a


956
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:15,086
SpriteKit scene into a texture


957
00:28:15,086 --> 00:28:16,176
and then apply it through some


958
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:17,846
3D geometry like we did in the


959
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,196
second demo we showed you this


960
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,326
is the method you'd want to


961
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:20,556
call.


962
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:25,276
The second method gives you more


963
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:26,656
granularity by allowing you to


964
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:28,956
direct which render command


965
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,516
encoder SpriteKit will encode


966
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:31,356
its render commands.


967
00:28:31,886 --> 00:28:33,136
This is good if you want to


968
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:34,486
directly mix SpriteKit and metal


969
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,966
content in the same render


970
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:36,376
target.


971
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:38,326
So you want to render some 2D


972
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:39,636
Metal content along with your


973
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,266
SpriteKit content or maybe you


974
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,036
want to overlay SpriteKit on top


975
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,456
of a Metal scene to display HUD


976
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:44,966
elements.


977
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:47,116
By using the same render command


978
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,436
and coder, you can do this much


979
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,366
more efficiently than if you


980
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,376
were using the first method.


981
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:54,356
All right, that's enough of an


982
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:55,076
API crawl.


983
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:56,286
Let's jump into a quick demo


984
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:57,366
showing SpriteKit rendering in


985
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,986
3D with Metal.


986
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:08,836
[ Applause ]


987
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:11,986
SO here we have a 3D scene in


988
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:12,416
Metal.


989
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:14,446
See we've got some nice lighting


990
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:16,626
and some shadows going on here


991
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,246
and we have this very tempting


992
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:20,566
looking arcade cabinet with our


993
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,176
beautiful SpriteKit framework


994
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:22,766
logo on it.


995
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:26,996
We walk up to it, Insert Coin,


996
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:28,296
that sounds like of tempting.


997
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,076
I've got a quarter here.


998
00:29:29,076 --> 00:29:30,126
Let's plop that baby in.


999
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:34,206
Oh, you see we've got a full


1000
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,416
SpriteKit scene rendering on


1001
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:38,786
this 3D Metal scene.


1002
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,296
And see we're using SKRenderer


1003
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,466
to render SpriteKit into a


1004
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:44,936
texture, which we're then


1005
00:29:44,936 --> 00:29:46,746
mapping onto the front of our


1006
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:47,836
arcade cabinet here.


1007
00:29:47,906 --> 00:29:49,956
And then we're just applying a


1008
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:53,116
cool CRT shader to an in Metal


1009
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:55,316
to give it this old school look.


1010
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,166
I can actually move around from


1011
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,516
any angle I want to here and I


1012
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,926
can interact with it like this.


1013
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:01,806
It's a little bit of askew, but


1014
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:02,766
you know, maybe this gives you


1015
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:04,206
some memories of playing on an


1016
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,116
arcade cabinet with your


1017
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:06,016
friends, you're all crowded up


1018
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:06,436
against it.


1019
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:08,716
And you can view this from any


1020
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:10,246
angle, you can view this all


1021
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:14,346
from a distance, and it shows


1022
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:15,836
you some of the things that you


1023
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:17,556
can do with SpriteKit when you


1024
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:18,386
use it with Metal.


1025
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:20,516
It let's you use it 3D and then


1026
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:21,676
you can do whatever you want


1027
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:22,396
with that texture.


1028
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:29,766
So that's SpriteKit and Metal


1029
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:30,456
working together.


1030
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:35,776
[ Applause ]


1031
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:37,446
SKRenderer gives you more


1032
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:38,936
control over SpriteKit than ever


1033
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:39,366
before.


1034
00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:40,716
It allows you to determine


1035
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:41,956
exactly when it updates and


1036
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:43,386
renders and by interacting


1037
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:44,936
directly with Metal you can use


1038
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:46,116
rendered SpriteKit content


1039
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:47,496
anyway you see fit.


1040
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:52,066
As you've seen today SpriteKit


1041
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,086
is useful in both 2D and 3D.


1042
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:55,976
It's built to work well with


1043
00:30:55,976 --> 00:30:57,216
other graphics frameworks like


1044
00:30:57,216 --> 00:30:58,436
SceneKit and Metal.


1045
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:00,086
And it's closely integrated with


1046
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:01,266
ARKit, so that creating


1047
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,956
augmented reality apps is as


1048
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:04,226
easy as possible.


1049
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,306
We've introduced new features


1050
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:07,586
that give you more control than


1051
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:08,826
ever allowing you to view


1052
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:09,916
SpriteKit content in the View


1053
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:11,706
Debugger and also giving you the


1054
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,386
ability to take direct control


1055
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:14,646
over when and how SpriteKit


1056
00:31:14,646 --> 00:31:15,876
updates and renders with a new


1057
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:16,656
SKRenderer.


1058
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:19,006
Today we've shown SpriteKit in


1059
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:20,156
an entirely new light and we


1060
00:31:20,156 --> 00:31:21,226
hope that it's given you some


1061
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,036
perspective on how you can use


1062
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:24,166
it in ways that you may have


1063
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,136
never thought of before.


1064
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,756

1065
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:29,916

And please check out these


1068
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:37,736
related sessions.


1069
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,236
We gave just a small taste of


1070
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:40,206
metal in today's section.


1071
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:41,866
So please check out Introducing


1072
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:42,996
Metal 2 if you're interested in


1073
00:31:42,996 --> 00:31:43,566
learning more.


1074
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:45,586
I highly recommend watching


1075
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:46,796
"Introducing ARKit" to learn


1076
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:48,336
more about how it works in


1077
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:48,886
detail.


1078
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:50,776
And if our quick look at


1079
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,346
SceneKit got your attention you


1080
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:53,136
should look at their main


1081
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:53,816
session this year.


1082
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:56,296
And there's a lot of great stuff


1083
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:57,986
in the Debugging with Xcode 9 on


1084
00:31:57,986 --> 00:32:00,266
top of SpriteKit working with a


1085
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,346
new View Debugger.


1086
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:03,076
Like wireless debugging which is


1087
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:04,386
really awesome, so I recommend


1088
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:05,176
watching that as well.


1089
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:07,756
Thanks everyone and please enjoy


1090
00:32:07,756 --> 00:32:08,716
the rest of the conference.
