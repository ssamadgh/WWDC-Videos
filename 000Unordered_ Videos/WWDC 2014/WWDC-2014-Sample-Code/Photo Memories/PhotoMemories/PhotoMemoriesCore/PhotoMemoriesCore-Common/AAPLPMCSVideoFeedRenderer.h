 Abstract:
 
  AAPLPMCSVideoFeedRenderer is a cross-platform object responsible for rendering the contents
  of a user's front-facing video camera as a sublayer of a target CALayer. Moreover, it offers
  the functionality of taking a snapshot, and returns a cross-platform image asynchronously
  when requested.
