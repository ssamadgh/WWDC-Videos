00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:15,500
[ Applause ]


2
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:23,496
>> So what's new on iOS?


3
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:27,836
For this release, a major theme


4
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:28,946
has been Wayfinding.


5
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:30,966
Now Wayfinding traditionally


6
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,056
refers to all the ways that we


7
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:34,926
can help guide people through an


8
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:36,606
environment and orient


9
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:37,806
themselves within a physical


10
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:38,196
space.


11
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,336
You encounter signage and


12
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,136
information systems everywhere


13
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:45,216
to help you find your way from


14
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:49,966
street signs, to airports, and


15
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,086
even in parking garages.


16
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,026
So naturally, our digital


17
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:55,646
environments can benefit from


18
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:56,566
clear navigation.


19
00:00:57,706 --> 00:00:59,806
Wayfinding in UI can enhance


20
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:01,256
your experience and


21
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:02,456
understanding of the space that


22
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:02,906
you're in.


23
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:07,316
Now when we design for iOS, our


24
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,646
goal is to highlight content


25
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:08,916
first.


26
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:11,796
But app layouts need clear


27
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:13,666
visual hierarchy so that people


28
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,966
know how to navigate through the


29
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:15,396
system.


30
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,466
UI elements in general should


31
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,416
not compete with content but


32
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,756
help you to better understand


33
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:24,056
potential functions and


34
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:24,726
interactions.


35
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:28,006
And we are constantly trying to


36
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:29,236
improve upon these themes.


37
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:32,136
So for iOS 11, we wanted to


38
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:33,326
provide more clarity for


39
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,896
navigation or Wayfinding


40
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,146
throughout the system.


41
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:39,176
We wanted to focus on overall


42
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:40,996
hierarchy through the use of


43
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:41,786
typography.


44
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,096
And when it would be useful, we


45
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,306
wanted to create greater


46
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,536
contrast by refining elements


47
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:49,086
within the UI.


48
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:51,886
So first, let's take a look at


49
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:52,556
navigation.


50
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:57,026
Last year we started using more


51
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,466
bold text in music because it's


52
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:00,696
an app with a lot of dense


53
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:01,376
content.


54
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:04,036
Text became instrumental for


55
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:06,036
organizing similar media and


56
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:07,326
orienting you while you browse


57
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,036
and search.


58
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:10,306
And we recognize that other apps


59
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,306
could benefit from the same text


60
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:12,656
treatments.


61
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:16,496
So this year, we introduce large


62
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,926
titles to navigation bars for


63
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:20,546
other apps that could use some


64
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:21,166
more emphasis.


65
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:23,936
This does not replace our


66
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,826
standard navigation but is an


67
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:27,826
opt-in version that transitions


68
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,736
from to the standard Nav bar


69
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:30,946
when you start scrolling.


70
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,646
Now you might be wondering where


71
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,176
these large titles should be


72
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:38,166
used and I can highlight a


73
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,746
couple guidelines to consider


74
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:41,606
that we found helpful when


75
00:02:41,606 --> 00:02:42,996
deciding which of our apps


76
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,336
they'd be most appropriate for.


77
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,456
A good place to use large-title


78
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:48,406
navigation can be at the top


79
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,026
level of an app with tabs.


80
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,216
This helps to understand that


81
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,086
you're at a top level but also


82
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,106
that you're scrolled to the top


83
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:55,856
of the page.


84
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,606
Again, music is a good example


85
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:01,186
of an app that uses large titles


86
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,916
for all of its top levels but


87
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,086
also occasionally on some


88
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,756
secondary levels or further


89
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:08,006
down.


90
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:11,206
Since music has so much content


91
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,926
and multiple levels that you can


92
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,256
drill into, large titles are


93
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:17,056
helpful as you navigate further


94
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:17,566
into the app.


95
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:21,996
They can be used for views that


96
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:24,006
all have very similar layouts as


97
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,566
a quick read on where you are.


98
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:28,446
Phone is an appropriate app to


99
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:30,746
use large titles because almost


100
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,306
all of the tabs show content in


101
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:33,946
rows of text.


102
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:37,436
And it's important to stress


103
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,266
that it's not always necessary


104
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,706
to use large titles in


105
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:41,386
navigation.


106
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,206
We found that in multiple


107
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:44,896
scenarios it would hinder


108
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,326
usability and not help.


109
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:48,976
And a good example of that is


110
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:49,656
the clock app.


111
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:52,846
Even though it's an app with


112
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,126
tabs, it doesn't have multiple


113
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,926
content to sort through and each


114
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,526
of the tabs has a very distinct


115
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:01,006
layout.


116
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,186
So large titles in this case


117
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:04,976
would compete with content.


118
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:09,006
Now let's take a closer look at


119
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:09,886
ways that we can improve


120
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:11,056
hierarchy through type.


121
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,886
Typographic hierarchy is the way


122
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:16,906
to organize type in a way that


123
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,616
will emphasize important content


124
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,286
over less important content and


125
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,466
it can help to group things


126
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:22,876
together.


127
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,596
This can reduce cognitive load


128
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:27,316
or the amount of mental effort


129
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:28,966
it takes you to find something


130
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:29,766
that you're looking for.


131
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,576
And there are a few basic


132
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:33,876
methods for establishing


133
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:35,056
typographic hierarchy.


134
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:40,856
The position of the text can


135
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:41,806
convey importance.


136
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:45,006
Since Label 1 is on top, we can


137
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,586
infer that it's more important


138
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:48,926
than Label 2, but that might not


139
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:50,326
be obvious in all cases.


140
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,336
So another way is to decrease


141
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:54,926
the size of the secondary line


142
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:57,876
or you can vary the weight or


143
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:59,076
you can use color so that the


144
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,556
secondary line recedes more.


145
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,696
You may need to use more than


146
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:06,226
one of these at a time so you


147
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:07,276
can make sure there's clear


148
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:09,316
hierarchy between the two.


149
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:12,456
Here's a screen from photos in


150
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:12,846
iOS 10.


151
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,156
The most important information


152
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:17,706
here is your content, your


153
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:18,216
photos.


154
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:21,526
The section headers use two text


155
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:22,886
sizes to distinguish different


156
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:24,866
information but all of it is a


157
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,196
tad small and light.


158
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:30,236
So for iOS 11, we made section


159
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,416
headers larger in general and


160
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,316
increased the text weight and


161
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:36,386
used gray for supporting text.


162
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:39,786
And these changes made it easier


163
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,606
to isolate important in content


164
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,056
so that you can find a


165
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,596
particular photo faster.


166
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:46,826
So let's look at more examples.


167
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,676
Here's Calendar in iOS 10.


168
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,346
We increased text weights for


169
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:55,236
more emphasis and used color


170
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:57,376
more intentionally to denote the


171
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,506
current year, month, and date.


172
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:04,606
Here is Weather in iOS 10.


173
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:08,066
For iOS 11, we increased the


174
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,796
text weights and made the text


175
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:12,586
overall larger so that the


176
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:16,226
content is easier to read.


177
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,016
So last, let's look at ways that


178
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,926
we've tried to improve contrast.


179
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,316
To create more balance with the


180
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,416
larger and more bold text styles


181
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:27,196
throughout the UI, we needed to


182
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:29,406
update other UI elements to give


183
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,196
them greater contrast while


184
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,646
keeping them both functional and


185
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:33,036
minimal.


186
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:34,626
So one of the ways we did this


187
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:37,036
was to fill in the button shapes


188
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,796
and increase the size of the


189
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:42,026
shape itself like we did with


190
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,806
the search field.


191
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,306
And we updated the tab bars


192
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,346
increasing the weight of the


193
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:51,466
label from regular to medium.


194
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,056
And for the glyphs, we filled in


195
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,366
the shapes and thickened the


196
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:56,046
stroke weights.


197
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,926
And to make better use of space


198
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:02,326
in landscape, we moved the label


199
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:03,506
so that it's side by side with


200
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:03,856
the glyph.


201
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,386
This tab bar is now shorter than


202
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:08,256
before and now matches the


203
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:10,106
landscape Nav bar and toolbar


204
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:10,336
height.


205
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:14,126
And a couple other things to


206
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,726
note are that the glyphs are


207
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:17,496
slightly smaller and the text is


208
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,106
slightly larger than the


209
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,006
portrait equivalents.


210
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,396
So you'll want to make sure you


211
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:23,036
take that into account for your


212
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,556
own apps.


213
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:27,936
On iPad, we can increase the


214
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,626
text size even more while


215
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:31,146
keeping the glyphs the same as


216
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:31,666
portrait.


217
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,636
This is the Wallet app from iOS


218
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:37,426
10.


219
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:39,116
And typically we use material


220
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:41,846
blurs to indicate when UI has


221
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,116
come in on top of a page that is


222
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:44,876
still underneath.


223
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,426
And we wanted to remove it in


224
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,226
areas, like in this example,


225
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:50,806
where it had no logical reason


226
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:52,546
for being there and did not


227
00:07:52,546 --> 00:07:54,066
reinforce where you are in the


228
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:54,846
digital space.


229
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:58,996
So that's a quick summary of the


230
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,246
design updates we've made for


231
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:01,296
iOS 11.


232
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:03,266
Keep these things in mind when


233
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,146
making and updating your apps.


234
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,236
Use large-title navigation if


235
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:09,966
areas of your app could use more


236
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:12,366
emphasis and to help orient


237
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:12,736
people.


238
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,356
But remember that it's not


239
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:15,896
always necessary to use


240
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:16,446
everywhere.


241
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:19,566
Consider whether your app could


242
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,956
benefit from refining


243
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,156
typographic hierarchy.


244
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,556
And lastly, remove superfluous


245
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:28,096
UI elements and complexity to


246
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:30,036
improve overall contrast in your


247
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:31,576
app.


248
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,006
We hope these updates will help


249
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:34,046
you to create great products


250
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:36,356
that are both beautiful and easy


251
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:36,686
to use.


252
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:37,716
Thank you


253
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,008
[ Applause ]


254
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,000
