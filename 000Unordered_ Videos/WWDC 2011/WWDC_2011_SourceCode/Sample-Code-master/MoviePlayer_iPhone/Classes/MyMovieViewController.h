Abstract:  A UIViewController controller subclass that implements a movie playback view.
Uses a MyMovieController object to control playback of a movie.
Adds and removes an overlay view to the view hierarchy. Handles button presses to the
'Close Movie' button in the overlay view.
Adds and removes a background view to hide any underlying user interface controls when playing a movie.
Gets user movie settings preferences by calling the MoviePlayerUserPref methods. Apply these settings to the movie with the MyMovieController singleton.
