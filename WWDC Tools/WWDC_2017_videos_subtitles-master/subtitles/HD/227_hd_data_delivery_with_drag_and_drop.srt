00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:23,406
>> Good morning.


3
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:29,776
Welcome to Session 227, Data


4
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:30,926
Delivery with Drag and Drop.


5
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,196
My name is Dave Rahardja, and


6
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:34,446
I'm joined here, today, by my


7
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:35,636
colleague Tanu, who's going to


8
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,476
be operating the demos.


9
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:41,596
So, if you've been following


10
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,106
along in our series of Drag and


11
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:44,886
Drop sessions, this diagram


12
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:46,146
should be pretty familiar to


13
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:46,656
you.


14
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:48,886
During this session, we're going


15
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:50,636
to be focusing on this part of


16
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,026
the diagram, Item Providers.


17
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:55,236
Now, Item Providers are


18
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,246
fundamental to the way data is


19
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:58,966
transferred between applications


20
00:00:58,966 --> 00:00:59,766
in drag and drop.


21
00:01:00,656 --> 00:01:02,346
So, in this session, we're going


22
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:05,066
to cover four topics about item


23
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:05,606
providers.


24
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,016
We're going to cover some


25
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:07,746
basics.


26
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:09,716
We're going to talk about how


27
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,996
uniform type identifiers help


28
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:13,556
your apps to be more compatible


29
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:16,066
with others in the system.


30
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:18,416
We're going to cover how you can


31
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,606
create model classes that work


32
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:21,916
really well with drag and drop.


33
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,086
And finally, we're going to


34
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,626
close out by covering some


35
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,656
advanced topics that'll add some


36
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,166
real polish to your apps in our


37
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:29,686
ecosystem.


38
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:31,806
So, let's get started.


39
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:35,206
Let's talk about some


40
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:36,766
NSItemProvider basics.


41
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,696
So, what's an NSItemProvider?


42
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:43,406
Simply put, an NSItemProvider is


43
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:44,226
a data promise.


44
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:47,916
All data is loaded through drag


45
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,616
and drop asynchronously and on


46
00:01:50,616 --> 00:01:50,996
demand.


47
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:54,996
An NSItemProvider can also, help


48
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:57,306
you to provide progress and


49
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,906
cancellation of data transfer.


50
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,736
And it is supported widely in


51
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:02,196
our API.


52
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:04,676
Of course, in drag and drop, but


53
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,886
also in UIPasteConfiguration.


54
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:08,686
And we've added API for


55
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:10,246
UIPasteboard, so that you can


56
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,126
use NSItemProvider directly with


57
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:12,806
it.


58
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,306
So, what does it mean to provide


59
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,516
data or promise data?


60
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:21,286
Providing data to an


61
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:23,006
NSItemProvider is really simple.


62
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:25,356
All you have to do is create an


63
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:27,266
NSItemProvider and pass it an


64
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,136
object that is suitable for use.


65
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:31,126
Now, a lot of our system


66
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:33,036
provided classes, such as


67
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,656
UIImage in a string, in its


68
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,466
attributed string can be used


69
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:37,846
this way.


70
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,246
And we'll see in a few slides


71
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,156
now, how you can make your


72
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:41,736
classes work in this fashion, as


73
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:41,896
well.


74
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:46,356
Once you provide the data, it


75
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,546
can be retrieved by the


76
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,296
receiving application equally


77
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,256
simply, by calling the


78
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,876
loadObject method on the


79
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:56,826
itemProvider, therein.


80
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,956
Remember that data transfer is


81
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:01,886
asynchronous and that your


82
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:03,456
completionHandlers will be


83
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:05,836
called on a nonmain cue.


84
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:07,606
So, if you're going to update


85
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:10,616
the UI with your received data,


86
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:12,986
be sure to dispatch back to the


87
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,246
main queue before you call UIKit


88
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:15,956
methods.


89
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:16,906
And you're going to see this


90
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:18,526
brought up a few times.


91
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:21,376
So, to show you how easy it is


92
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:23,126
to use NSItemProviders, we're


93
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:24,576
going to start with a demo.


94
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:24,896
Tanu.

[ Applause ]


96
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:34,346
>> Good morning, everyone.


97
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:36,436
You've now heard of drag and


98
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:38,186
drop and NSItemProviders.


99
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:39,866
But now, you're probably


100
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,486
wondering how to use these in


101
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:42,016
your own apps.


102
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:44,616
My name is Tanu Singhal, and


103
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,466
I'll show you a simple demo that


104
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,806
will help you get started with


105
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:48,946
NSItemProviders.


106
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:03,766
We have an app, here, that has a


107
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,196
list of customers for our


108
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:05,766
product.


109
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,156
Now, I met some new people who


110
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:09,796
are also interested in trying


111
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:10,646
out this product.


112
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,716
So, I noted their names down in


113
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:13,326
Reminders.


114
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,546
It would be nice if could drag a


115
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:19,305
name and drop it into my app.


116
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:20,836
So, how do we do this?


117
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:22,736
Let's look at the


118
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:24,316
TableViewController for our


119
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:25,766
Contacts app.


120
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:28,716
Before I start typing I want you


121
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:30,496
to know that we made the sample


122
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:31,846
code for this available on the


123
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:32,766
developer website.


124
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,316
So, you don't have to worry


125
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,716
about jotting down everything,


126
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:36,166
right now.


127
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:41,096
In the TableViewController, I'll


128
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,686
add a TableViewDropDelegate.


129
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,616
Let's also set this delegate.


130
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:49,516
You may have heard of the


131
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:51,516
TableViewDropDelegate in


132
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,356
previous sessions.


133
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:54,956
But if you haven't, then don't


134
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:55,316
worry.


135
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,636
Because for now, we only need to


136
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,416
implement one method called


137
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,956
TableView performDropWith


138
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:01,636
coordinator.


139
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:05,456
In this method, I'll iterate


140
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:08,206
over the drag items provided by


141
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:09,126
the ItemProvider.


142
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:10,726
Sorry, the dragItems provider by


143
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:11,396
the coordinator.


144
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:15,536
Now, each dragItem has its own


145
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:16,426
itemProvider.


146
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:18,796
And we can check whether the


147
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,786
itemProvider can load objects of


148
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:21,556
a certain type.


149
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,646
So, I'm going to check if the


150
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:25,576
itemProvider can load a string.


151
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,696
For that, I'll call the


152
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,216
canLoadObject method.


153
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,836
If it can load it, then I'll


154
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:34,506
call the loadObject method.


155
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,796
And the completionHandler of


156
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,086
this loadObject method will give


157
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,866
me an object which will be a


158
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,146
string that I can use to update


159
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,226
my data models, as well as my


160
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:45,476
UI.


161
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,206
One thing to note is that the


162
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:51,836
completionHandler is on the


163
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:52,756
background thread.


164
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,026
So, if you want to make any


165
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:56,456
changes to your UI, then you


166
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,756
need to go back to the main


167
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:58,986
thread, and then make those


168
00:05:59,026 --> 00:05:59,516
changes.


169
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:03,886
So, let me dispatch my main


170
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:04,356
queue.


171
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:06,606
And in the main thread I'll use


172
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,226
the string object, and I'll


173
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:10,726
insert it into the TableView.


174
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,536
This code is ready to run, now.


175
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,116
Wait just a moment.


176
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:22,646
And this time, I can drag a name


177
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:24,746
from Reminders and drop it into


178
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:25,886
my app.


179
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,466
The canLoadObject and LoadObject


180
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,116
methods can also be used for


181
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,976
other system types, like


182
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,486
attributed strings, URLs,


183
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,116
images, and even colors.


184
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:42,126
So, now that you've seen how


185
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:44,256
straightforward it is to handle


186
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:46,566
system objects in your using


187
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:48,616
itemProviders, I would encourage


188
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:50,806
all of you to try out these


189
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:51,266
APIs.


190
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,556
Up next, Dave will talk about


191
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:54,816
Progress and Cancellation.

194
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:08,636
So, that covers the basics about


195
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,196
how to use NSItemProviders in


196
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:10,966
your application.


197
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:12,116
It was really simple.


198
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,936
Now, let's talk about progress


199
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:14,676
and cancellation.


200
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:18,056
When you retrieve data using


201
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,936
NSItemProviders, we return a


202
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,926
progress object to you that


203
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:25,346
allows you to track the progress


204
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,056
of data transfer as it occurs.


205
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:30,436
The progress object has two


206
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:31,596
interesting properties on it,


207
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:32,726
that you might want to observe.


208
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,676
The first, is the


209
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:36,386
fractionCompleted property,


210
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:38,306
which tells you from zero to


211
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:40,116
one, how much of the data has


212
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:40,706
been transferred.


213
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:44,156
And the second, is an isFinished


214
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:46,196
property that tells you that the


215
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:47,156
data transfer has been


216
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:48,686
completed, whether it is


217
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:49,456
successful or not.


218
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:53,126
You can use key value observing


219
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:55,936
to watch these two properties


220
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,986
and update your UI accordingly.


221
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,896
Such as by providing your own


222
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:02,276
progress indicator and


223
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:03,966
cancellation button.


224
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,476
There is a cancel method on the


225
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:09,006
progress object that will


226
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:10,286
immediately cancel the data


227
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:11,206
transfer, as well.


228
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:14,536
When you call he cancel method


229
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,206
on the return progress object,


230
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:18,266
your receiving application will


231
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,306
receive, will get a callback on


232
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,156
the completionHandler with an


233
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:23,926
error in it, regardless of


234
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:24,936
whether or not the source


235
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,806
application has cancelled their


236
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:27,696
data providing.


237
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,956
You get one progress object per


238
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:33,876
load request.


239
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:36,056
However, there's an overall


240
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,736
progress object that you can get


241
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,916
from the UIDropSession that


242
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,285
allows you to monitor and cancel


243
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,756
the entire remaining data


244
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:46,126
transfer in progress.


245
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,716
So, now that we've covered the


246
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:51,596
basics, let's talk about


247
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:53,156
maximizing compatibility.


248
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:57,506
You want your application to


249
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,486
provide data to as many other


250
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:01,276
applications on the system, as


251
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:01,696
possible.


252
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:05,466
And receive drops from as many


253
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,836
applications, as possible, as


254
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:07,046
well.


255
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,836
The key to understanding how to


256
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,346
maximize compatibility is


257
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,136
understanding uniform type


258
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:15,826
identifiers.


259
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:18,306
So, let's recap.


260
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,466
One NSItemProvider represents


261
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,356
one thing that the user is


262
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,986
dragging across the glass.


263
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,186
However, there can be multiple


264
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:30,376
representations that you can


265
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:32,106
make available for every item


266
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,446
that the user is dragging.


267
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:35,596
Let me give you an example.


268
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,816
If you're writing a vector


269
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:39,476
drawing program, for example,


270
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:41,496
you could offer a native file


271
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:43,816
format for best quality as the


272
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,766
thing that you're dragging.


273
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,546
But you might also offer


274
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:51,056
conversions to PDF, PNG, or even


275
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:53,176
JPG, so that you can drop this


276
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,036
item on a variety of destination


277
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:55,746
applications.


278
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:59,386
Uniform type identifiers allow


279
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:01,666
you to tag these representations


280
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:02,786
with unique strings that


281
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:05,456
identify the kinds of data that


282
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:07,976
you're putting up for the drag.


283
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,046
For a native file format, you


284
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,256
can define your own strings,


285
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:12,766
such as


286
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,536
com.yourcompany.vector-drawing.


287
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,986
And for commonly known types,


288
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:21,326
such as PDF and PNG, you can use


289
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,976
the symbols defined in mobile


290
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:28,206
core services to tag them.


291
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,186
Now, fidelity order matters.


292
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,776
The order in which you register


293
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:35,086
your representations should


294
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,746
correspond to the order of


295
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:38,986
quality that you're making


296
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,446
available to the destination.


297
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,766
Usually, the highest fidelity


298
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:43,916
would be your internal data


299
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:44,846
representation type.


300
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,886
And then, followed by the next


301
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:49,926
high fidelity common type, and


302
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,426
so on and so forth.


303
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:55,176
Now, one tip to remember when


304
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,046
using type identifiers to


305
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:59,336
register your representations,


306
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:03,216
is that there are uniform type


307
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:04,926
identifiers that correspond to


308
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,356
abstract types.


309
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:09,626
Such as data, or plain text, or


310
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:10,096
image.


311
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:12,926
Avoid these.


312
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,916
Instead, use concrete data types


313
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:18,906
that help the consumer of your


314
00:11:18,906 --> 00:11:21,476
data interpret the bytes that


315
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:22,486
you're going to send over to


316
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:22,716
them.


317
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:25,226
So, for example, use


318
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,926
utf8-plain-text, instead of


319
00:11:27,156 --> 00:11:28,236
plain-text.


320
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,556
Or probably .png instead of


321
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,516
image, so that the receiver can


322
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,386
interpret your data.


323
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:37,436
Of course, for your private type


324
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:38,616
identifier, you're free to


325
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,326
define your own data types and


326
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:40,996
byte layouts.


327
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:46,596
So, you've seen how these


328
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:48,536
multiple representations allow


329
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:50,196
you to maximize compatibility.


330
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,396
But you didn't see any of this


331
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:54,416
type identifiers being used in


332
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,016
our initial example code of


333
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,126
creating NSItemProviders.


334
00:11:58,446 --> 00:11:59,636
So, how did this work together?


335
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:04,196
This is where we talk about


336
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:05,986
creating model classes that


337
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,496
harness the power of both


338
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:08,786
multiple representations for


339
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:09,566
compatibility.


340
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,006
And the simplicity of using


341
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:13,516
objects to initialize


342
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:14,346
itemProviders.


343
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:19,366
To create model classes that


344
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:21,246
work well with drag and drop,


345
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,676
we're going to talk about two


346
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,466
protocols that help you to do


347
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:26,696
this.


348
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,556
NSItemProviderReading and


349
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:30,806
NSItemProviderWriting.


350
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:32,966
Let's talk about the writing


351
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:33,716
protocol, first.


352
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,946
NSItemProviderWriting exports


353
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:39,546
data from your model object and


354
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:43,246
NSItemProviderReading imports


355
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:45,406
data and creates a model object


356
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,226
from a representation.


357
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:52,336
And by adopting these protocols,


358
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,716
you can maintain the conversion


359
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,836
between your model objects and


360
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:58,446
multiple representations with


361
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:02,546
your model object and not with


362
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:04,706
the UI code.


363
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:06,216
So, let's take a look at


364
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,326
NSItemProviderWriting.


365
00:13:07,446 --> 00:13:10,796
This is what it looks like.


366
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,476
There are only two things that


367
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,766
you need to implement to conform


368
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:16,476
to this protocol.


369
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:18,796
The first is a


370
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:21,036
writableTypeIdentifiersForItem


371
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,236
Provider property.


372
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:24,696
This is the list of the type


373
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,516
identifiers that you can export


374
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,046
in fidelity order.


375
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:29,736
Highest fidelity first.


376
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,646
And then, a loadData method


377
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,986
which will take that


378
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:37,056
typeIdentifier that has been


379
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:38,286
requested by the other


380
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:39,186
application.


381
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,506
Which will call a


382
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:43,216
completionHandler, either with


383
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:44,256
the data that you've made


384
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,566
available or with an error.


385
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:49,266
By implementing this protocol,


386
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:52,746
the UI code can look like this


387
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,526
and our framework code will do


388
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:58,626
the equivalent of this, for you.


389
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:03,606
All right.


390
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,236
Let's take a look at the reading


391
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:05,636
protocol.


392
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:07,476
The reading protocol is, of


393
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:08,896
course, the other end of the


394
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:09,126
pipe.


395
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:13,906
It too, has two things that you


396
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:14,556
need to implement.


397
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,126
The first is the list of


398
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:19,756
readable type identifiers in


399
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:20,866
fidelity order, also.


400
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:23,386
And the second, is that


401
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:26,306
initializer that will take a NS


402
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,676
data block, a NS data object,


403
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,316
which should be used to


404
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,586
initialize the instance of your


405
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:33,976
object.


406
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,526
When you implement this protocol


407
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,736
the UI code can look like this,


408
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:43,866
a canLoadObject.


409
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:45,736
You can pass it to your vector


410
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:46,566
drawing object.


411
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,936
And when you call the


412
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,406
loadObject, our framework code


413
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:53,916
will matchmake the two lists of


414
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:55,286
type identifiers, both from the


415
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:56,486
provider and the consumer.


416
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,306
To find the best match to ensure


417
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:00,886
that the highest quality data is


418
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,116
used to create an instance of


419
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:03,046
your object.


420
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,096
So, in short, to make model


421
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:08,846
classes that work well with drag


422
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:10,926
and drop, you should create,


423
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,646
these classes should conform to


424
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:15,886
NSItemProvider reading and


425
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:16,846
writing protocols.


426
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,976
Because these are Objective-C


427
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:20,916
protocols, your model classes


428
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,306
should also inherit from


429
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:22,866
NSObject.


430
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:25,886
And when you do this, you can


431
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,486
use your classes and your


432
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,556
objects wherever NSItemProvider


433
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,886
is supported, drag and drop, and


434
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,526
UIPasteConfiguration, and also,


435
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:35,826
with the new API in


436
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,026
UIPasteboard.


437
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:39,726
So, to show you how this is done


438
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,496
in code, I'm going to ask Tanu


439
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:42,556
to do another demo.


440
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:48,576
[ Applause ]


441
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:49,806
>> Hello, again.


442
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,296
In the previous demo, we learned


443
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:54,296
to load simple system objects


444
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:54,926
like strings.


445
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,966
Now, let's see how we can drag a


446
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,886
rich contact card from the


447
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:02,176
Contacts app and drop that into


448
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:02,916
our app.


449
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:09,756
To do this, I've created a class


450
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,376
called ContactCard.


451
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,736
This holds the name, phone


452
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:15,436
number, and photo for a contact.


453
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:18,486
Now, I'm going to go back into


454
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:20,016
the TableView controller, and


455
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:22,076
this is the performDrop method


456
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,586
that we implemented, before.


457
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,716
Last time, we were trying to


458
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:27,556
load a string.


459
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,336
Now, we want to load a contact


460
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:30,736
card.


461
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,496
So, I'll replace all instances


462
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,806
of NSSTring with ContactCard.


463
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:41,596
Since we are requesting a


464
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:43,166
contact card the


465
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,896
completionHandler will directly


466
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,706
give me a contact card object,


467
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,286
and I can use that to insert


468
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:50,276
into my TableView.


469
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,926
Now, this should have worked,


470
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:53,256
right?


471
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,376
But the reason we're getting


472
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,336
errors, here, is because the


473
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:59,066
NSItemProvider does not


474
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,896
recognize my ContactCard class.


475
00:17:01,356 --> 00:17:03,326
So, we need to do a little work


476
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,195
to conform to the


477
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,386
NSItemProvider.


478
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,596
Let's look at the ContactCard


479
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:09,126
class, again.


480
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:12,086
And here, I'm going to implement


481
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:14,016
the NSItemProviderReading


482
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:14,576
protocol.


483
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:16,136
This will tell the


484
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,455
NSItemProvider that I can read


485
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,736
data that it provides.


486
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,056
Now, I need to specify the types


487
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:26,026
of identifiers that I can read.


488
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:29,306
My ContactCard class can read


489
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:31,626
either a vCard, or it can read


490
00:17:31,686 --> 00:17:33,056
plain text.


491
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:34,956
Note that these need to be


492
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:37,536
specified in descending order of


493
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:38,086
fidelity.


494
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,576
If we specified plain text


495
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,006
first, then we would always get


496
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:44,366
called back for plain text.


497
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,796
Even when a more rich vCard type


498
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:47,546
was available.


499
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:50,656
So, after we've specified the


500
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,916
types we can read, we're going


501
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,616
to set up an initializer where


502
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,926
we'll actually read the data


503
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:58,166
from the itemProvider.


504
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,196
One of the arguments in this


505
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,226
initializer is the


506
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,256
typeIdentifier.


507
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:06,036
So, I can use that to figure out


508
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,126
what type of data I received.


509
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,156
If I got a vCard, I'll use a


510
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:12,936
helper method to set the phone


511
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,246
number, picture, and all the


512
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:15,516
other information I need.


513
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:17,616
If I just got plain text, I'm


514
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:19,376
going to set the name for my


515
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,236
contact card.


516
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:24,376
Now, when we run this, those


517
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:25,576
errors are resolved.


518
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:26,926
This is because the


519
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:29,206
NSItemProvider understands our


520
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:29,926
class, now.


521
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:33,656
So, this time, I can drag and


522
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:35,056
name from the Contacts app on


523
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:37,196
the right, and drop it into my


524
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:37,306
app.


525
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,416
As you can see, we loaded the


526
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,926
name, phone number, as well as


527
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:43,406
the photo for this contact.


528
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:47,316
Note that we can still drag out


529
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:50,296
plain text, like from the


530
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:51,776
Reminders app, again.


531
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:54,246
And this works, because our


532
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,836
ContactCard class not only


533
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,446
handles vCards, but it also


534
00:18:58,496 --> 00:18:59,496
handles plain text.


535
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,726
So, this is what we wanted.


536
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,396
And our users really like this


537
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:03,846
feature.


538
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:06,706
But now, we have another feature


539
00:19:06,706 --> 00:19:07,176
request.


540
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,786
They want the ability to drag


541
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:12,276
out contacts from our app and


542
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,926
drop it into other apps.


543
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:16,796
In order to implement that,


544
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,336
we'll have to conform to another


545
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:21,826
protocol called


546
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,906
NSItemProviderWriting protocol.


547
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:28,166
As part of this protocol, I'll


548
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,376
specify the types of identifiers


549
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:32,116
that I can write.


550
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:34,866
My class can again, write either


551
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:38,366
a vCard or plain text.


552
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,756
After this, we need to specify a


553
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:41,796
loadData method.


554
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:45,096
In this method, we'll create the


555
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:47,506
data that we want to provide to


556
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:48,496
the itemProvider.


557
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,466
So, based on the type


558
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:52,846
identifier, I can create


559
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:55,326
different types of data and I'll


560
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,426
just pass it to the


561
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:57,476
completionHandler.


562
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,996
Now, we have completed the


563
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,106
implementation for the


564
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:03,976
NSItemProviderWriting protocol.


565
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:06,876
There's just one last thing to


566
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:07,126
do.


567
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,716
We need to go back into our


568
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:12,186
TableViewController and tell the


569
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:14,316
TableView that it can be used to


570
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:15,546
drag out items.


571
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:19,286
To do this, I'll implement the


572
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,606
TableViewDragDelegate.


573
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:23,456
We need to set this delegate,


574
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:23,986
too.


575
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:27,886
And for this delegate, we'll


576
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:30,186
implement one method called


577
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:31,556
itemsForBeginning session.


578
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:35,676
In this method, I'm going to


579
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:37,096
create an itemProvider.


580
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:39,586
And you can see that I'm able to


581
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:42,166
pass a ContactCard object


582
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:44,196
directly to the itemProvider's


583
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:45,056
initializer.


584
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:47,646
This works only because we


585
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,666
implemented the


586
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,356
NSItemProviderWriting protocol.


587
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,446
Let's run this code, now.


588
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,356
And I would like to share a


589
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,186
contact with my colleague on


590
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:05,916
Messages.


591
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:09,606
So, let me drag out Dinesh's


592
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:11,086
contact and drop it.


593
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:16,456
As you can see, we were able to


594
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:18,356
send out the name, phone number,


595
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:19,316
as well as the photo.


596
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:20,856
Which is what we were trying to


597
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:21,466
accomplish.


598
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:24,796
So, now we have learned how the


599
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,326
NSItemProvider reading and


600
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:30,326
writing protocols can be used to


601
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,556
transfer data using custom class


602
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:34,146
objects.


603
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,286
These are really powerful


604
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:38,186
protocols and we think you'll


605
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:39,806
find them extremely useful when


606
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:41,266
you implement drag and drop in


607
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:41,826
your own apps.


608
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,516
Up next, Dave will cover some


609
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:45,446
advanced topics.


610
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:51,956
[ Applause ]


611
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:53,176
>> Thanks, Tanu.


612
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,936
So, cool. All right.


613
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,206
Next, we're going to cover some


614
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:00,066
advanced topics.


615
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:01,966
These are just some collection


616
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:03,586
of things that is very good to


617
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:04,466
know, when you're going to


618
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:05,556
polish your app so that it


619
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:06,946
shines in the drag-and-drop


620
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:07,496
environment.


621
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:10,056
The first thing we're going to


622
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:11,616
cover is data marshaling.


623
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,016
So, if you look at the


624
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,706
NSItemProvider API in iOS 11,


625
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,556
you'll discover that there are


626
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,416
three ways you can provide data.


627
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:23,326
You can provide data as a data


628
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:24,416
object, obviously.


629
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:27,176
But you can also provide data as


630
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:30,306
a file or a folder on your file


631
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:30,776
storage.


632
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:35,126
Third, you can provide the data


633
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:37,296
as a reference into a File


634
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:37,796
Provider.


635
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:39,346
We'll talk about File Providers


636
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:39,816
more, later.


637
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:45,026
Similarly, the receiver of the


638
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,756
data can retrieve data in three


639
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:47,596
different ways.


640
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:50,526
They can copy it as their own NS


641
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:51,106
data object.


642
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:54,436
They can copy a file or a folder


643
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:55,326
into their container.


644
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:59,086
And they can attempt to open the


645
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,366
file in place.


646
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:04,936
So, three ways to provide data,


647
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,096
and three ways to consume it.


648
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:08,606
What do you have to do to make


649
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:10,286
sure that data transfer happens


650
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:11,716
seamlessly, and that the data is


651
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:12,866
made available in the correct


652
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:13,266
format?


653
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:15,856
Well, the good news is you have


654
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:16,466
to do nothing.


655
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
We do it for you.


656
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,406
Data marshaling makes sure that


657
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:22,836
the provider of the data can


658
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,196
provide and consume the


659
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,416
information in the way that's


660
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:29,016
most convenient for them.


661
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,666
If you provide a file and then,


662
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,536
you consume it as a data, we


663
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:34,886
will read the file into an


664
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:35,906
NSData object for you.


665
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,206
If you provide an NSData and you


666
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:40,656
ask for a file copy, we'll write


667
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:43,066
it to file storage and give you


668
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:44,226
your L reference to it.


669
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,246
If they provided a folder and


670
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:49,106
you asked for NSData, we will


671
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:50,276
zip up the contents of the


672
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:52,176
folder and give you an NSData of


673
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:52,896
the zip file.


674
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:56,826
And if they provide a reference


675
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,286
to a file provider and you ask


676
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:02,856
for a file copy, we will call in


677
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:03,916
the promises for the file


678
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,796
provider and make a copy on your


679
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:05,976
behalf.


680
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:10,326
All right.


681
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:12,906
So, we've seen how progress and


682
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:14,286
cancellation worked from the


683
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:14,986
consumer side.


684
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:17,036
So, I want to talk a little bit


685
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:18,026
about how progress and


686
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:19,926
cancellation works on the


687
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:20,616
provider's side.


688
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:22,946
I'm going to show you a block of


689
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:23,536
code, here.


690
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,096
Don't worry that it's a dense


691
00:24:25,126 --> 00:24:26,086
block of code, because I'm going


692
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:27,206
to highlight the parts that are


693
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:28,426
most important.


694
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:30,966
This is a loadData


695
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,426
implementation for our


696
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:34,806
NSItemProviderWriting.


697
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:38,366
In which you are going to use a


698
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,466
dataLoader object to


699
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:40,986
incrementally load data.


700
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:44,966
To provide progress and


701
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,136
cancellation support, the first


702
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,076
thing you have to do is create


703
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:49,256
your own progress object.


704
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:51,446
In this case, we're creating one


705
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:53,086
with a UnitCount of 100 as a


706
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:53,606
percentage.


707
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:57,046
On that progress object, you can


708
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,686
attach a cancellationHandler


709
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:00,026
that will be called when the


710
00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:01,526
consumer of your data calls


711
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,096
cancel on their instance of the


712
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:03,826
progress object.


713
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:06,656
In this case, all we're doing is


714
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:08,076
setting a local variable from


715
00:25:08,076 --> 00:25:10,406
true to false, which should stop


716
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:12,596
the dataLoader from loading the


717
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:13,226
next chunk.


718
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:17,716
As the dataLoader progresses,


719
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,616
you can update the


720
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:20,066
completedUnitCount on your


721
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:22,186
progress object to drive the


722
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:23,216
progress indicator on the


723
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:23,626
receiver.


724
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,976
And of course, you have to


725
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:27,376
return your own progress object


726
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:30,026
so that we can type it over to


727
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:33,416
the other side.


728
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:33,866
All right.


729
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:34,626
Switching gears, now.


730
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,006
We're going to talk about some


731
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:40,576
features that help you to polish


732
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:43,576
your data representations when


733
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,596
creating suites of apps.


734
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:48,046
So, we're going to talk about


735
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,576
Per-Representation Visibility.


736
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:51,636
Remember, you can provide


737
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,026
multiple representations of your


738
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:54,616
data in NSItemProvider.


739
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,146
You can restrict the visibility


740
00:25:57,146 --> 00:25:59,556
of each representation to either


741
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:01,316
visible to only your source


742
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:02,006
application.


743
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:04,816
To the applications that are


744
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:06,966
assigned by your team, so in


745
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,846
your suite of apps, or to


746
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:09,286
everyone.


747
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:12,506
You can use this property to


748
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:15,986
hide private types that you are


749
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:18,116
rapidly maintaining with


750
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:19,406
versions of your application


751
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:19,756
suite.


752
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:20,926
So, you don't have to worry


753
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:23,466
about third parties serializing


754
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,846
your data to disc.


755
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:29,586
In a similar vein, you have a


756
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,956
team data property on


757
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:31,836
NSItemProvider.


758
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:35,396
This is an eight kilobyte data


759
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:37,176
block that you can attach


760
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:38,866
through an NSItemProvider.


761
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:40,896
They are only visible to other


762
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:42,416
applications in your team.


763
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:45,706
You can use this to improve your


764
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:46,916
UI in any way you see fit,


765
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,226
during a drag.


766
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,016
This is metadata, and can be


767
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,556
retrieved even before the user


768
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:52,326
lifts their finger.


769
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:56,586
All right.


770
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:58,286
There is a suggestedName


771
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,246
property on the NSItemProvider.


772
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:02,916
If you provide a string for the


773
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,926
suggested name, we will use it


774
00:27:04,926 --> 00:27:06,116
as a file name when the


775
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:08,646
retriever writes your data to


776
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:09,576
disc.


777
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,986
This is especially useful, of


778
00:27:11,986 --> 00:27:13,076
course, when you're providing an


779
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:13,416
NSData.


780
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:18,836
And the last property I want to


781
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,706
talk about is Preferred


782
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,436
Presentation Size.


783
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:26,906
This is a CG size property that


784
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,646
you can provide to give a hint


785
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,126
to the receiver about how big


786
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:32,446
your representation's going to


787
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:34,096
end up after they've laid out.


788
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,326
This is used, for example, by


789
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,946
Mail, to drop images into the


790
00:27:38,946 --> 00:27:40,626
Mail Compose sheet, into the


791
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,876
destination layout, even before


792
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:43,616
the data arrives.


793
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,016
And finally, I'm going to talk


794
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:50,546
about File Providers.


795
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:52,556
So, File Providers is a whole


796
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:53,626
other topic, on its own.


797
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:57,046
But a short summary can be said


798
00:27:57,046 --> 00:27:57,746
as follows.


799
00:27:58,246 --> 00:27:59,596
A File Provider is an app


800
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:00,116
extension.


801
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,576
This app extension allows data


802
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:05,196
transfer from a network


803
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,906
download, for example, to


804
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:08,486
continue even if your main


805
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,156
application has been terminated.


806
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,066
For long running drags, this is


807
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,126
especially useful.


808
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,886
Because as the user waits for a


809
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:19,686
download to occur, they may


810
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:21,486
navigate away from your app, and


811
00:28:21,696 --> 00:28:23,566
your app could get terminated.


812
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,196
If you provide a URL to a file


813
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:29,356
inside a File Provider


814
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:31,956
container, the File Provider


815
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:33,456
extension will continue to serve


816
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:35,376
the data transfer request, even


817
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:36,886
though your UI application is


818
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:37,426
terminated.


819
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:39,226
And that increases the chances


820
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:40,196
that your data is going to be


821
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:41,196
transferred successfully.


822
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:45,906
And as an added bonus, if you


823
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,446
create a File Provider that


824
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:49,246
appears in the file's app, we


825
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:51,366
will allow you to drag and drop


826
00:28:51,366 --> 00:28:52,856
URLs that can be opened in


827
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,236
place.


828
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:54,836
Which means that multiple


829
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,086
applications can access that


830
00:28:57,086 --> 00:28:58,896
same file, instead of getting


831
00:28:58,896 --> 00:28:59,566
their own copy.


832
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,436
There's some really great


833
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:03,806
information available in the


834
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:04,936
following two sessions.


835
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:06,966
I highly recommend that you


836
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,346
attend them, if you are


837
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,486
interested in providing File


838
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,636
Providers in the context of drag


839
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:14,566
and drop.


840
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:15,046
All right.


841
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:17,866
Next, we're going to take a look


842
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:18,996
at what we can do with files in


843
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:20,546
drag and drop, by having Tanu do


844
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:20,976
another demo.


845
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:25,996
[ Applause ]


846
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:27,246
>> Hope you are ready for


847
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,006
another demo.


848
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:30,976
In the previous demo, we saw how


849
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:32,606
we could drag and drop simple


850
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:34,196
system objects, as well as


851
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:35,526
custom class objects.


852
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:38,026
Now, let's see how we can handle


853
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:38,566
files.


854
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:40,856
We'll look at our customer's


855
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:41,266
app, again.


856
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:43,676
And for some people, here, we


857
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:45,796
have additional data.


858
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:48,416
Like for Adam, we know what


859
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,646
products he's purchased.


860
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:52,586
Now, I would like to drag out


861
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:55,416
this file into another app and


862
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:56,736
potentially edit it, there.


863
00:29:57,976 --> 00:30:00,666
To implement this, I'll look at


864
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,796
the ContactDetailsViewController


865
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:03,946
in my customer's app.


866
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:09,696
Over here, we will add a drag


867
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:12,156
interaction to the attachment


868
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:13,496
image that we just saw.


869
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:17,386
Let's also, implement the Drag


870
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:18,426
Interaction Delegate, right


871
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:19,806
here, because we have set the


872
00:30:19,806 --> 00:30:20,836
delegate to self.


873
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:23,426
You may have heard of the drag


874
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:24,816
interaction delegate in previous


875
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:25,326
sessions.


876
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,316
If you're interested in learning


877
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:28,756
more about this delegate, I


878
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:30,596
would encourage you to check out


879
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,536
the video for Session 213 on


880
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:33,516
Mastering Drag and Drop.


881
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:35,726
For the purposes of this demo,


882
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:37,516
though, we'll only look at one


883
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:39,356
method, called itemsForBeginning


884
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:39,886
session.


885
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:44,066
In this method, we'll create a


886
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:47,046
new itemProvider, and on the


887
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:50,316
itemProvider we'll call a method


888
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:50,676
called


889
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,346
registerFileRepresentation.


890
00:30:52,606 --> 00:30:54,766
This method takes four


891
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:55,396
arguments.


892
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:58,176
The first one is the type


893
00:30:58,176 --> 00:30:58,796
identifier.


894
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:01,136
Our attachment file was actually


895
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:01,676
an image.


896
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,576
So, I've set the type identifier


897
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:04,336
to JPEG.


898
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,176
The second parameter is file


899
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:07,766
options.


900
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,786
This can be used to specify if


901
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,756
we want other apps to open our


902
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:14,956
file in place, or if we want


903
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,856
them to make a copy.


904
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:17,986
We would like them to open our


905
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:19,716
file in place, so we can see the


906
00:31:19,746 --> 00:31:20,496
changes they make.


907
00:31:20,496 --> 00:31:23,206
The third parameter is


908
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:23,896
visibility.


909
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,296
This can be your own process,


910
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,236
your team, or all.


911
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:29,896
I've just set it to all.


912
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:32,176
Finally, we have the


913
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:33,196
completionHandler.


914
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:35,556
And we are going to pass the URL


915
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:38,026
file into this


916
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,586
completionHandler.


917
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:44,146
So, let's get the URL, first.


918
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:45,896
Over here, I have a helper


919
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:48,466
method that grabs the URL for my


920
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:50,356
file from a File Provider.


921
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:52,946
I need to use a File Provider


922
00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:54,746
only when I'm opening files in


923
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:55,276
place.


924
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:57,646
If I wanted other apps to make a


925
00:31:57,706 --> 00:31:59,796
copy, then I do not need a File


926
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:00,266
Provider.


927
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,596
I could have just provided a


928
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:02,546
local URL.


929
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,756
We'll pass this URL to the


930
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,106
completionHandler.


931
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:10,026
Now, our itemProvider is set up.


932
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:11,826
And we can use this to create a


933
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:12,766
drag item.


934
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:16,336
With this, the code is ready to


935
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:16,746
run.


936
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:26,076
So, now I can drag out this


937
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:26,606
file.


938
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:30,436
And let me open another app


939
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:31,566
where I'll drop it.


940
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:39,726
So, we'll drag out the data,


941
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:42,196
drop it into a document editing


942
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:42,276
app.


943
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:45,356
And I'm concerned now, that Adam


944
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:46,736
is buying a lot of products from


945
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:47,696
our competitor.


946
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,176
So, let me highlight this and


947
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,226
save these changes.


948
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,826
So, since our document editing


949
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:56,146
app actually used the URL


950
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:57,756
provided by the customer's app,


951
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,846
you'll see that we got the same


952
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,436
changes back in our customer's


953
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:02,506
app.


954
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:07,336
[ Applause ]


955
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:08,806
Glad you like that.


956
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:12,276
We've now seen how to handle


957
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:14,366
system objects, custom class


958
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:16,756
objects, as well as files.


959
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,466
We have a wide range of APIs


960
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,156
that you can adopt.


961
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:22,566
And we look forward to seeing


962
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:23,666
how you use them.


963
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:25,586
Back to Dave, to summarize.

965
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:32,516
>> Thank you, Tanu.


966
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:35,136
All right.


967
00:33:35,326 --> 00:33:36,266
Let's recap.


968
00:33:37,736 --> 00:33:39,286
During this session, we've seen


969
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,666
how an NSItemProvider is


970
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,586
fundamental to the way data is


971
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:45,716
transferred between applications


972
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:46,786
in Drag and Drop.


973
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,326
We've seen how multiple


974
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:50,846
representations allow your


975
00:33:50,846 --> 00:33:52,866
applications to maximize


976
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,206
compatibility with other


977
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:55,026
applications.


978
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:57,936
And we've seen how data is


979
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:00,256
transferred asynchronously with


980
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:02,256
progress in a cancellable


981
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:02,936
fashion.


982
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:06,246
We've also seen how


983
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:07,906
NSItemProvider reading and


984
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:09,426
writing protocols allow you to


985
00:34:09,426 --> 00:34:11,976
make model classes that work


986
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:13,966
well with drag-and-drop UI code.


987
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,476
And how visibility and team data


988
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:20,716
allows you to create suites of


989
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:22,255
apps that work in especially


990
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,906
well together during drag and


991
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:26,686
drop.


992
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:28,485
And finally, we've seen how File


993
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,766
Providers afford you the ability


994
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:32,985
to open files in place as the


995
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:36,815
result of drag and drop.


996
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:38,235
For more information, please


997
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:39,576
visit our developer website,


998
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:41,226
Session 227.


999
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:45,366
And I highly encourage you to


1000
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:47,356
attend the File Provider related


1001
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,025
sessions, today and tomorrow, to


1002
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:51,196
learn more about how to create


1003
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:53,025
File Providers for your own


1004
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:53,636
applications.


1005
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:56,036
If you haven't seen the first


1006
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,806
three sessions on Drag and Drop,


1007
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:58,986
I highly recommend that you


1008
00:34:58,986 --> 00:34:59,926
review them on video.


1009
00:35:00,426 --> 00:35:02,606
Thank you, for your attention,


1010
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:03,976
and have a great WWDC.
