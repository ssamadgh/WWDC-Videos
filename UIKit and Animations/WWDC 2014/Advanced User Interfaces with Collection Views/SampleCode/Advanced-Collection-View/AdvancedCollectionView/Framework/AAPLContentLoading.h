 Abstract:
 AAPLLoadableContentStateMachine — This is the state machine that manages transitions for all loadable content.
  AAPLLoading — This is a signalling object used to simplify transitions on the statemachine and provide update blocks.
  AAPLContentLoading — A protocol adopted by the AAPLDataSource class for loading content.

/** A specialization of AAPLStateMachine for content loading.

 The valid transitions for AAPLLoadableContentStateMachine are the following:

 - AAPLLoadStateInitial → AAPLLoadStateLoadingContent
 - AAPLLoadStateLoadingContent → AAPLLoadStateContentLoaded, AAPLLoadStateNoContent, or AAPLLoadStateError
 - AAPLLoadStateRefreshingContent → AAPLLoadStateContentLoaded, AAPLLoadStateNoContent, or AAPLLoadStateError
 - AAPLLoadStateContentLoaded → AAPLLoadStateRefreshingContent, AAPLLoadStateNoContent, or AAPLLoadStateError
 - AAPLLoadStateNoContent → AAPLLoadStateRefreshingContent, AAPLLoadStateContentLoaded or AAPLLoadStateError
 - AAPLLoadStateError → AAPLLoadStateLoadingContent, AAPLLoadStateRefreshingContent, AAPLLoadStateNoContent, or AAPLLoadStateContentLoaded

 The primary difference between `AAPLLoadStateLoadingContent` and `AAPLLoadStateRefreshingContent` is whether or not the owner had content to begin with. Refreshing content implies there was content already loaded and it just needed to be refreshed. This might require a different presentation (no loading indicator for example) than loading content for the first time.
