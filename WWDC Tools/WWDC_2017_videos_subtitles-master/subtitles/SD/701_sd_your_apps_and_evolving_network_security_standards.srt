00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:33,196
[ Applause ]


2
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:35,746
>> Good morning and welcome to


3
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,316
your Apps and Evolving Network


4
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,326
Security Standards.


5
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:41,086
My name is Bailey Basile and I'm


6
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,636
secure transports engineer at


7
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:43,086
Apple.


8
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,406
Today, my colleague Chris and I


9
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,966
will be talking to you about the


10
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,876
ways that network security


11
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,106
standards change and how that


12
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:52,616
affects you and your apps.


13
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:55,896
We know that all of you care as


14
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,936
much about your users' privacy


15
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,256
and security as we do.


16
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,446
And that's why when you see


17
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:04,226
attacks like BEAST, and CRIME,


18
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:06,656
and DROWN, you worry about


19
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:09,856
whether your app is affected.


20
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,346
Unfortunately, all protocols


21
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:15,856
age, and as they are in the


22
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:18,166
public more attacks are found


23
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,086
over time.


24
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:23,356
Even worse, the algorithms upon


25
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:26,906
which these standards rely have


26
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:29,346
a built-in shelf life.


27
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,126
That means that as they age and


28
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:34,886
as computers get faster, those


29
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,726
algorithms become vulnerable to


30
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,926
attacks like collisions,


31
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:41,696
factorization and brute force.


32
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,856
When you hear about these scary


33
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,286
sounding attacks like a FLAME


34
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:49,586
and BREACH, and POODLE.


35
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:51,136
Well, maybe poodle doesn't sound


36
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:51,686
so scary.


37
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,316
When you hear about these scary


38
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:56,856
attacks, you wonder what you can


39
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:59,336
do to prevent your app from


40
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,066
appearing in the press the next


41
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:03,146
time a big attach happens.


42
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,376
And that's why today, I'm going


43
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,736
to be talking about some best


44
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:09,466
practices that you can follow in


45
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,926
order to ensure that your app is


46
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:12,716
not affected.


47
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,986
I'll also talk a little bit


48
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:18,896
about how Apple helps you by


49
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,956
removing insecure options from


50
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:21,916
our platforms.


51
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,416
Chris will then give you an


52
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:26,356
update on app transport


53
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,156
security, which is a mechanism


54
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:30,736
that you can use in your apps in


55
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,286
order to ensure that best


56
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,856
practices are enforced.


57
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:36,916
Finally, Chris will be giving


58
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,466
you a talk about Transport Layer


59
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:42,386
Security, or TLS and an exciting


60
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,416
new evolution in that protocol.


61
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:46,966
So, let's dive right into those


62
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,046
best practices.


63
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,876
I'll start at a high level.


64
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,256
First, the biggest thing you


65
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,386
have to remember, because as I


66
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,476
said, those protocols age, and


67
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:00,376
those standards have a built-in


68
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:03,186
shelf life, you can't set and


69
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:05,576
forget the security of your app.


70
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,246
You have to go through on a


71
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,886
regular basis and make sure that


72
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,386
your app is up to date.


73
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,926
And to know what to change, you


74
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:16,516
should be following standards


75
00:03:16,556 --> 00:03:19,226
bodies, academic research and


76
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:21,506
industry best practices.


77
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:24,706
But the good news for all of


78
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,996
you, is that you are already


79
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,776
doing this because you're here


80
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:29,366
today.


81
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:34,076
If you are a developer or a


82
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:35,916
library developer, you may be


83
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,416
using a third-party library in


84
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,466
your app.


85
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,276
And those can be very risky.


86
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:42,986
In particular, if you're


87
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:44,226
integrating a third-party


88
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:46,136
library you have to be sure you


89
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,246
keep it up to date.


90
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:49,376
A library that you integrated


91
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:52,156
three years ago is already out


92
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:54,576
of date and maybe using weakened


93
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:55,406
security.


94
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,446
That means that your users are


95
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,166
not getting the security that


96
00:03:59,166 --> 00:03:59,766
you want.


97
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,096
If you're using our APIs, we


98
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,026
help you here.


99
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,396
First, we remove many of the


100
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:10,146
insecure options from our APIs


101
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,406
so that you aren't affected.


102
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:15,586
We also make available App


103
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:18,255
Transport Security, or ATS, in


104
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:19,736
order for you to be able to


105
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:21,755
enforce those best practices in


106
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,986
your app, as long as you are


107
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:26,246
avoiding ATS exceptions.


108
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,436
Finally, when those attacks


109
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,236
happen, before those attacks


110
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:34,446
happen you have to remind your


111
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:37,306
clients, investors and managers


112
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:39,246
that it is worth the maintenance


113
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:42,126
cost to update your app so that


114
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:44,376
when the next attack happens you


115
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:46,526
are not scrambling to remediate


116
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,716
the problem wasting time and


117
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:51,536
energy and money as your app


118
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,516
appears in the press named as


119
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:59,086
one of the bad apps.


120
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,196
So, let's take a look back at


121
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,376
those attacks I was talking


122
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:03,076
about earlier.


123
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,246
I'd like to go through some


124
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,126
detailed best practices that you


125
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,806
can use to avoid these attacks.


126
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:11,036
Specifically, in the area of


127
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:13,506
encryption, cryptographic


128
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:17,776
hashes, public keys, protocols,


129
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:19,846
and revocation.


130
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:23,326
So, let's start right off the


131
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:24,546
bat with encryption.


132
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,236
Encryption, as all of you know


133
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:29,786
is a mechanism that you can use


134
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:31,996
to prevent your users' data from


135
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:33,756
being read by an attacker.


136
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,556
But unfortunately, some of the


137
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:38,246
algorithms that we've been using


138
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,036
for encryption for a long time


139
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:42,536
are vulnerable to attacks where


140
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:46,226
the key material or the plain


141
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,136
text could be recovered by an


142
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:48,766
attacker.


143
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:51,096
In particular, RC 4 is


144
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:53,986
vulnerable to an attack where


145
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,896
the key is recoverable within as


146
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:57,646
little as three days.


147
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:00,906
Furthermore, the CBC modes of


148
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:04,856
both Triple-DES and AES are


149
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:06,816
vulnerable to attacks like BEAST


150
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:11,036
and Lucky 13 that mean that the


151
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:13,106
algorithm is not providing the


152
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,086
same level of security as you


153
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:18,646
want your users to have.


154
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,696
We plan to remove both RC 4 and


155
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:25,336
Triple-DES from TLS across our


156
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:26,856
platforms in the future.


157
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,916
So, now is the time to upgrade.


158
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:32,926
Instead, you should be using


159
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,526
authenticated encryption


160
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:37,206
algorithm like AES-GCM or


161
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:39,726
ChaCha20/Poly1305.


162
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:42,026
Those will ensure that you have


163
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,426
both the best encryption and can


164
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,516
detect when that data has been


165
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:48,196
modified.


166
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:50,726
Speaking of modified data.


167
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:52,156
Let's talk now about


168
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:53,826
cryptographic hashes.


169
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:56,516
As you know, cryptographic


170
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,446
hashes are a mechanism that


171
00:06:58,446 --> 00:07:01,136
allows you to detect when the


172
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,556
input data has been changed.


173
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,716
But unfortunately, some of the


174
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,536
cryptographic hash algorithms


175
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,896
that we've been using are


176
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,086
vulnerable to what's called a


177
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:11,856
collision attack.


178
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,126
A collision attack is where two


179
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,866
different inputs produce the


180
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,546
exact same output.


181
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:21,046
And so, you can't tell when an


182
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,606
attacker has modified the data


183
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:25,396
because the hashes will be the


184
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:25,986
same.


185
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:29,716
In particular, both MD 5 and


186
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,026
SHA-1 have demonstrated


187
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:32,636
collision attacks.


188
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:37,096
In fact, an MD-5 collision was


189
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:39,296
used in the Flame malware in


190
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,896
order to bypass platform


191
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:43,756
security and gain access to


192
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:44,826
users' systems.


193
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:48,506
We removed trust in all MD-5


194
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:50,096
signed certificates across our


195
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:52,166
platforms in previous years.


196
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,616
SHA-1 just recently had an


197
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:57,036
attack.


198
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,726
The Shouted attack was performed


199
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,656
earlier this year, and so this


200
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:03,396
is the freshest information.


201
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:06,806
Knowing that the SHA-1 one


202
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,516
attack was imminent, we removed


203
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,756
trust in all SHA-1 signed


204
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,446
certificates for TLS servers


205
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:16,936
when connecting through WebKit


206
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,126
and Safari.


207
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,376
And we've seen such an


208
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:23,346
improvement in the disk use of


209
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:25,696
SHA-1 certificates, that today


210
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:26,856
I'm announcing that we're


211
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,516
removing trust across all TLS


212
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:32,015
connections for SHA-1 signed


213
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:32,716
certificates.


214
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,066
I'll talk a little bit more


215
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,616
about how that affects you and


216
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,296
your app later on.


217
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:41,216
Instead, you should be using any


218
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,296
of the SHA-2 family of hashes in


219
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,746
order to get that best security


220
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,766
and avoid these collision


221
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:50,316
attacks.


222
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:51,836
Next, I'd like to talk about


223
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:52,786
public keys.


224
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,746
Public keys, as you know, are a


225
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:58,346
mechanism that provides an


226
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:00,746
identity, a sort of identity for


227
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:01,186
you.


228
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:03,906
Such that other people can


229
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:05,676
verify that something you signed


230
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:07,526
was signed by you and not


231
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:08,206
someone else.


232
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:11,256
And can be used to send you


233
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:14,026
encrypted data that only you can


234
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:15,906
decrypt with your private key.


235
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,646
But unfortunately, RSA key sizes


236
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:22,236
smaller than 1024 bits are


237
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:25,856
vulnerable to factorization


238
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,166
attacks.


239
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:30,566
In particular, a 768-bit RSA key


240
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:33,966
was factored back in 2009 and


241
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:36,806
that's why we removed trust from


242
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,436
any certificates using key sizes


243
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,866
smaller than 1024 bit RSA back


244
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:44,956
in the spring of 2016.


245
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:49,916
But the reality is even 1024 bit


246
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,856
RSA key sizes are not good


247
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:53,226
enough.


248
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,796
And we expect that an attack on


249
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,866
a 1024 bit RSA key is imminent.


250
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:02,556
And that's why today I'm


251
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:04,136
announcing that we're removing


252
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,836
trust from certificates using


253
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,346
key sizes smaller than 2048 bits


254
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:11,976
across all TLS connections to


255
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:12,546
servers.


256
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,406
In order to avoid these removals


257
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,586
and ensure that you have best


258
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,596
security, you should be using


259
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:22,986
RSA key sizes greater than or


260
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:26,526
equal to 2048 bits, or any of


261
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,966
the elliptic curves that are


262
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,916
trusted on our platforms.


263
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:33,396
Next, I'd like to spend some


264
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:34,916
time talking about protocols.


265
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,696
Protocols, as you know, are the


266
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,956
mechanism that you actually use


267
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,436
to talk to servers.


268
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:44,196
They are interoperable, which


269
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:45,346
means that you don't have to


270
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,336
worry whether the server you're


271
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:49,306
talking to across the world


272
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,086
supports the protocol you're


273
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:51,666
using.


274
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:53,956
Unfortunately, some of these


275
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:58,026
protocols are weak or provide no


276
00:10:58,136 --> 00:10:59,886
security in particular.


277
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,716
If you are using http all of


278
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,326
your users' data is being


279
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:05,936
transmitted in the clear.


280
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,106
That means that anyone listening


281
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,996
in knows exactly that data.


282
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,796
But some of the older TLS


283
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:16,356
versions, like SSL Version 3,


284
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:20,986
TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 are also


285
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:23,086
vulnerable to numerous attacks.


286
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,426
And so, you should be avoiding


287
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:28,746
these when you configure your


288
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:29,346
servers.


289
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:32,656
We removed the use of SSL


290
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:36,136
Version 3 back in fall of 2015.


291
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,786
So, you've been protected on


292
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:39,386
that count for a while.


293
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:42,176
Instead, you should be using


294
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:47,146
HTTPS, that is HTTP over TLS,


295
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:50,246
with TLS 1.2.


296
00:11:50,846 --> 00:11:53,266
TLS 1.2 is the current best


297
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,636
standard available for TLS


298
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:57,496
security.


299
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,376
But I'm pleased to announce


300
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:00,876
today that we're adding support


301
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:03,166
for the draft specification of


302
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:04,706
TLS 1.3.


303
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,376
Chris will be talking more about


304
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:08,696
that a little bit later.


305
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,936
Finally, I'd like to talk about


306
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:13,076
revocation.


307
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:15,646
Revocation is the mechanism that


308
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:18,546
clients use to verify the


309
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,916
certificate and determine


310
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,326
whether that certificate should


311
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:23,946
be trusted in the event that a


312
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:26,996
certificate is mishandled or


313
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:28,296
missed issued.


314
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:31,036
And of course, the worst thing


315
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:32,636
you can do in the area of


316
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:36,746
revocation is not check it.


317
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:39,466
Unfortunately, our platforms do


318
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,896
not check revocation by default


319
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,176
currently and I'll explain why


320
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:44,896
later.


321
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:48,196
That is, unless of course you


322
00:12:48,196 --> 00:12:50,266
are using OCSP Stapling.


323
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:53,136
OCSP being the Online


324
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:54,996
Certificate Status Protocol.


325
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,606
If your servers are using OCSP


326
00:12:57,606 --> 00:13:00,776
Stapling, your certificates are


327
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,116
always being checked for


328
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:02,866
revocation.


329
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:05,646
So, let's drill down into how


330
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:09,326
OCSP and OCSP Stapling work.


331
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:13,596
First, as usual, a server


332
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:15,906
requests a certificate from a


333
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,816
trusted third-party called a


334
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:18,966
certificate authority.


335
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:22,206
The server then uses that


336
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,306
certificate to identify itself


337
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:26,676
to clients connecting to it.


338
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:29,486
The client, in order to verify


339
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:32,406
that identity, then requests


340
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:34,796
information as to the status of


341
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,696
that certificate from the


342
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,136
certificate authority.


343
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:39,976
The certificate authority


344
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:41,876
replies back with a signed


345
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:44,676
message indicating the status of


346
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:45,996
the certificate that the client


347
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,626
is looking at.


348
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:49,096
The client verifies that


349
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,916
response and then uses that


350
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,366
status to determine whether to


351
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,356
continue the connection to the


352
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:55,836
server.


353
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:59,516
But unfortunately, OCSP has some


354
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:00,076
drawbacks.


355
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,636
As you can see from that


356
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:04,736
previous description It requires


357
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,846
an additional network connection


358
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:08,896
for every connection to the


359
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:09,446
server.


360
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,806
That means that your connections


361
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:15,346
in your apps appear slower and


362
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:17,696
none of us want that.


363
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:20,726
Furthermore, OCSP is performed


364
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:21,836
in the clear.


365
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:23,616
That means that all of the


366
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:25,166
traffic indicating which


367
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:27,016
certificate the client wants


368
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:29,306
checked is visible to anybody


369
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:30,216
watching.


370
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:33,076
And the reason that OCSP is


371
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:35,366
performed in the clear is that


372
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,816
it you would need it to


373
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:40,136
establish a secure connection.


374
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,746
So, if you had to establish a


375
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:44,486
secure connection to get OCSP,


376
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,046
you might end up in a circular


377
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:46,646
problem.


378
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,786
That's why OCSP is a huge


379
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:51,386
compromise of your users'


380
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:52,156
privacy.


381
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:54,146
Since all that information is in


382
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:54,716
the clear.


383
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:57,546
Anyone who is listening can and


384
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,296
find out what servers that


385
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:00,786
client is connecting to.


386
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:03,416
Furthermore, that third-party


387
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:06,006
certificate authority can


388
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,506
aggregate data as to which IP


389
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:10,286
address is which clients are


390
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:13,366
talking to which servers and


391
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,516
sell that to anybody they want.


392
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:18,566
So, that's very bad.


393
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,916
These 2 drawbacks are the reason


394
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,436
that we do not have OCSP enabled


395
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:25,256
by default.


396
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,156
And if you wanted to enable OCSP


397
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:30,566
in your app you would have to


398
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:33,786
integrate additional APIs.


399
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:36,996
So, next I want to talk about


400
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:39,126
OCSP Stapling, which is a


401
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:42,666
dramatic improvement on OCSP and


402
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:44,646
an evolution in the protocol


403
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,356
that removes many of the


404
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,326
drawbacks of OCSP.


405
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:51,116
As before, the server gets a


406
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,976
certificate from the certificate


407
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:53,546
authority.


408
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,646
But before sending that


409
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,536
certificate to a client, the


410
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:01,156
server requests the OCSP


411
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:04,256
response from the certificate


412
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:04,826
authority.


413
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:06,336
And when it gets that signed


414
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:08,956
response back, the server


415
00:16:08,956 --> 00:16:11,216
verifies it and then sends it


416
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,306
along with the certificate to


417
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:13,846
the client.


418
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:16,756
The client can then verify both


419
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,426
the certificate and the


420
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:19,486
revocation status


421
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:20,746
simultaneously.


422
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,326
So, this is a huge win, both in


423
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:25,096
terms of performance, because


424
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:26,506
you don't need that additional


425
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:27,636
network connection on your


426
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:28,076
client.


427
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,236
And in terms of privacy, because


428
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,806
the client doesn't have to


429
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:35,216
connect to a third party to find


430
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,166
out about the revocation status.


431
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,346
But even OCSP Stapling has some


432
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:41,876
drawbacks.


433
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,946
We've noted that despite


434
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:46,956
encouraging all of you to adopt


435
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,556
it on your servers, that


436
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,226
adoption has been slow.


437
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:54,006
We are aware that enabling OCSP


438
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:56,696
in some of the open source


439
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,176
server implementations does have


440
00:16:59,176 --> 00:16:59,606
drawbacks.


441
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:02,076
But we, nonetheless, encourage


442
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:05,146
you to fix those issues and to


443
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:07,806
adopt OCSP in order to improve


444
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:10,955
the security and the speed of


445
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,796
your app.


446
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:15,856
But the worst thing about OCSP


447
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:17,766
is that it actually doesn't


448
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,516
protect users against malicious


449
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:21,116
servers.


450
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,665
In particular, the malicious


451
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:26,195
server just need omit the


452
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:28,616
stapled OCSP response and the


453
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:31,276
client will never know that that


454
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:33,016
malicious server has a revoked


455
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:33,786
certificate.


456
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:36,446
That's why I'm pleased to


457
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,066
announce to you today that we


458
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,946
are enhancing revocation across


459
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,266
all of our platforms.


460
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:46,256
And it starts with us.


461
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:49,126
First, we gather information


462
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:51,176
from certificate transparency


463
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:51,646
logs.


464
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:54,246
Certificate transparency logs or


465
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:58,256
CT logs contain cryptographic


466
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,376
proofs of the existence of a


467
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:01,136
certificate.


468
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,166
You can find out more about CT


469
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:06,856
and how it works and how you can


470
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:08,336
use it to enhance the security


471
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,626
of your app by watching last


472
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:13,066
year's "What's New in Security"


473
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:13,666
session.


474
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:16,696
We use the information from the


475
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,966
certificate transparency logs to


476
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:21,056
find out about all of the


477
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:22,646
certificates that are trusted on


478
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:23,516
our platforms.


479
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,406
And if you want to help us


480
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,086
gather information about your


481
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,806
certificates in your apps and


482
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:32,246
your servers, you should verify


483
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,286
that your certificates are


484
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:35,936
logged to a CT log.


485
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,176
Many CA's will do this for you


486
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,886
so you just need check.


487
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:45,406
With that information, we now


488
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:47,206
know all of the certificate


489
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:50,126
authorities that are trusted on


490
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,056
our platforms.


491
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,336
And from that information we can


492
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:57,076
request all of the revocation


493
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,736
information from those


494
00:18:58,736 --> 00:18:59,866
certificate authorities.


495
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:03,316
We then gather all of that


496
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,756
revocation information back.


497
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,566
We aggregate it into a single


498
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,796
efficient bundle, and then make


499
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:11,746
it available to all of our


500
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:12,136
clients.


501
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:15,516
Those clients check in


502
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:18,466
periodically with us to get that


503
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,466
bundled revocation information,


504
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,916
and use that latest status


505
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:27,386
revocation information when


506
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:30,046
checking server certificates


507
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:31,206
that they are using.


508
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:36,176
If the client hits a certificate


509
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:38,346
that is listed there, the client


510
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,436
will then perform OCSP.


511
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:43,586
Unless of course your app is


512
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:45,866
using OCSP Stapling.


513
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,586
The client uses this to verify


514
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:51,206
that the certificate really is


515
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:51,726
revoked.


516
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:54,436
So, we think this is a dramatic


517
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:56,336
improvement on the existing


518
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:58,246
state of revocation on our


519
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:58,986
platforms.


520
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:02,346
It has a dramatic improvement in


521
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:04,496
the privacy compromise area.


522
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:06,896
The bundle that we provide of


523
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:08,296
revocation information is the


524
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:09,996
same across all of our clients


525
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:11,756
and all of our platforms.


526
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:15,106
So, we never know which clients


527
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:16,906
are connecting to which servers.


528
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:20,016
Furthermore, only certificates


529
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:23,636
that are in that list require


530
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:26,156
the additional OCSP connection.


531
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:30,946
So, only the limited set of


532
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:33,436
certificates there risk that


533
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,796
additional privacy compromise if


534
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:38,076
your servers are not using OCSP


535
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:38,826
Stapling.


536
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,556
Another huge advantage is that


537
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:47,376
the information is automatically


538
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:48,216
updated.


539
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,316
That means that the client


540
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:52,946
always have that freshest


541
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:55,026
revocation information available


542
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,906
to them when making all of their


543
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:59,476
connections and this means that


544
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:01,156
you also get this for free.


545
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:03,196
You don't need to make a single


546
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,176
API call to get this best


547
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,906
practice security and faster


548
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:08,806
connections.


549
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:12,426
So, I've covered a lot of ground


550
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:14,036
in the last 20 minutes and I'd


551
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:16,346
like to recall what we talked


552
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:16,726
about.


553
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,636
First we talked about encryption


554
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,766
and using authenticated


555
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:24,856
encryption ciphers in your


556
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:25,956
servers and your apps.


557
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:29,836
We talked about hashes and how


558
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:33,236
to avoid collision attacks.


559
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,936
We talked about public keys and


560
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:38,336
using strong public keys that


561
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:40,966
are not subject to


562
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:42,176
factorization.


563
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:45,246
We also talked about protocols


564
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:47,826
and using the latest protocols


565
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:51,966
like TLS 1.2 and HTTPS to secure


566
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,266
your apps.


567
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,316
Finally, we talked about


568
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:57,916
revocation and how you can


569
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,276
improve the security of your app


570
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,186
by using revocation and OCSP


571
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:04,736
Stapling on your servers, and


572
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,506
the ways in which we've helped


573
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,596
you with a brand-new revocation


574
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:09,246
mechanism.


575
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:12,586
Now, I promise you that I'd talk


576
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:14,956
a little bit more about those


577
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:16,616
trust removals that I announced


578
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:17,226
earlier.


579
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,286
Let's go back and recall what


580
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:22,006
those trust removals were.


581
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,396
First, I announced that we would


582
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:28,676
be removing trust in any SHA-1


583
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:30,906
signed certificate for


584
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:32,786
connections to TLS servers


585
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:34,986
across all of our platforms.


586
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,816
I also announced that we would


587
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,356
be removing trust in


588
00:22:39,396 --> 00:22:41,976
certificates using key sizes


589
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:46,446
smaller than 2048 bit RSA, also


590
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:48,266
in all TLS connections to


591
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:48,736
servers.


592
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:52,086
If you are connecting to a


593
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,976
server using TLS that has one of


594
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:58,256
these weak certificates, your


595
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:01,106
app will fail to make that


596
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:04,166
connection on macOS High Sierra


597
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:07,366
and iOS 11, and watchOS 4 and


598
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,996
tvOS 11.


599
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:13,516
Let's back up and remind


600
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:16,496
ourselves what certificates this


601
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,196
trust removal does not affect


602
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:19,926
based on my description.


603
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,876
First, this does not affect root


604
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:24,556
certificates.


605
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,466
In particular, root certificates


606
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:29,936
are not subject to the type of


607
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,376
collision attacks that we are


608
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,076
worried about with the SHA-1.


609
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:38,526
Also, we already removed all


610
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:40,116
roots certificates using key


611
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:43,026
sizes smaller than 2048 bits


612
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:45,996
back in fall of 2015.


613
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,666
So, you've been protected there


614
00:23:47,786 --> 00:23:48,616
for awhile.


615
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,906
These trust removals also do not


616
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:53,826
affect enterprise distributed


617
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:55,966
certificates through mobile


618
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,816
device management or MDM.


619
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:00,486
It also doesn't affect user


620
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:02,626
installed certificates through


621
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,596
mail, Safari or keychain access.


622
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:08,336
Finally, it also doesn't affect


623
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:11,096
client certificates when used


624
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:13,516
with mutual authentication in


625
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:13,986
TLS.


626
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:16,776
It's not that we're not worried


627
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:19,076
about attacks on the


628
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,236
certificates, we are.


629
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,156
But we know that it takes time


630
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,886
for enterprises and users to


631
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:29,676
update all of their certificates


632
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:31,956
and their infrastructures to use


633
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:33,496
the latest algorithms.


634
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,346
And so, we're giving them just a


635
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:36,596
little bit more time.


636
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:39,936
I promise that we will be


637
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,086
removing trust in those


638
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:42,376
certificates later on.


639
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:44,896
So now is the time to start


640
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,516
updating, not then.


641
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,506
Now, you're probably wondering


642
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:51,036
what this looks like.


643
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:52,646
Because if it's affecting your


644
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:53,746
app, you need to know.


645
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,596
If you are in Safari, you see an


646
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:57,726
error dialog that looks


647
00:24:57,726 --> 00:24:59,106
something like this.


648
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,776
And if we drill into the


649
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:04,056
certificate pane, we see that


650
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:06,136
there's a specific error message


651
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,416
for these removed weak


652
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:08,916
certificates.


653
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,616
And that's how you will know if


654
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,136
you're connecting to such a


655
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:13,766
certificate.


656
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:16,536
Now, many of you are app


657
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:18,206
developers and so you care more


658
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,346
about what you're going to see


659
00:25:19,346 --> 00:25:20,086
in the logs.


660
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,706
Because you may never connect to


661
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,806
this server through Safari.


662
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:25,796
If you're looking in the logs,


663
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,036
you're going to see an invalid


664
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:33,086
searching or -9807 SSL error in


665
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,836
your URL session or URL


666
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:35,506
connection.


667
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,836
There's only one thing that you


668
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:41,636
can do in order to fix this


669
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:43,996
problem and that is to have your


670
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:46,456
server administrators upgrade


671
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:48,056
their servers to use new


672
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:48,986
certificates.


673
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:52,346
The good news is that all


674
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:54,016
certificate authorities trusted


675
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,146
on our platforms only issue


676
00:25:57,146 --> 00:25:58,556
certificates that are not


677
00:25:58,796 --> 00:26:01,446
subject to these removals and


678
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:03,196
you can find a list of all of


679
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:04,776
the root certificates that are


680
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:08,926
trusted on our platforms at this


681
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:09,146
link.


682
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,156
So, we've covered quite a bit


683
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:13,986
more ground now and I think I at


684
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:15,796
least am wondering what should I


685
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:18,656
do when I go back to my office.


686
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:21,626
How can I ensure that I have


687
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:23,056
best security.


688
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:24,756
And the very first thing you


689
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:26,916
should do is check your


690
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,026
implementations, libraries and


691
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,766
servers against those best


692
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,386
practices that I've listed.


693
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,646
We even have that handy chart


694
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:36,976
that you can use to ensure that


695
00:26:36,976 --> 00:26:39,096
you have those good algorithms.


696
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:42,006
If you're a server developer you


697
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,656
might actually have quite a bit


698
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:46,416
of work to do in order to ensure


699
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,236
you have the best security for


700
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:49,296
all of your clients.


701
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:52,366
You should go through and


702
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:55,336
replace any SHA-1 or weak RSA


703
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,376
key certificates so that your


704
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:00,626
clients will not see failures on


705
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:01,786
our platforms.


706
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:04,546
And if you haven't already, you


707
00:27:04,546 --> 00:27:06,816
should upgrade your servers to


708
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:09,946
TLS 1.2 and one of those


709
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:11,936
authenticated encryption ciphers


710
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:13,286
that I listed earlier.


711
00:27:14,756 --> 00:27:16,986
You should allow the client to


712
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:19,506
determine what order to use


713
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:22,326
those ciphers because the


714
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:25,346
clients may be optimizing to use


715
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:27,806
the best and fastest cipher as


716
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,356
opposed to one of the slower


717
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:32,106
equally secure ciphers.


718
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:34,716
If you haven't already should


719
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:37,866
also enable OCSP Stapling so


720
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,166
that you can be sure that all of


721
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,556
your clients always have up to


722
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,436
date revocation information and


723
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,756
don't have to make privacy


724
00:27:46,756 --> 00:27:48,866
compromising additional network


725
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:49,656
connections.


726
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,886
Finally, in order to help us


727
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:54,836
with our new revocation


728
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:56,746
mechanism you should check that


729
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:58,726
your certificates are being logs


730
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,496
to a certificate transparency


731
00:28:00,496 --> 00:28:00,836
log.


732
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,246
Now many of you are probably app


733
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,096
developers.


734
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,616
And the good news for you is


735
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:09,926
that you have only one job.


736
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:13,016
Our platform has made it easy to


737
00:28:13,016 --> 00:28:15,556
adopt best practices and all you


738
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:18,616
have to do is avoid ATS


739
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,796
exceptions.


740
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:22,026
If you are using an ATS


741
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:22,626
exception.


742
00:28:22,626 --> 00:28:25,856
You are saying that connection


743
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:28,606
should have weaker security than


744
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:30,536
our platform can enforce.


745
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:34,716
So, now Chris is going to talk


746
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:36,236
to you about app transport


747
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:37,996
security a little bit more and


748
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:39,436
give you an update on the


749
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:40,676
current status.


750
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:41,326
Chris.


751
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:48,696
[ Applause ]


752
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:49,826
>> Thank you, Bailey.


753
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:51,906
Now, continuing along this


754
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,206
thread of best practices, I want


755
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,666
to dive a little bit deeper into


756
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:57,136
ATS.


757
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:57,956
ATS for those that aren't


758
00:28:57,956 --> 00:28:59,126
familiar is a feature we


759
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:01,106
released in iOS 9 and


760
00:29:01,596 --> 00:29:02,966
[inaudible] aimed at increasing


761
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:04,346
the security and privacy of your


762
00:29:04,346 --> 00:29:05,126
customers' data.


763
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:09,106
ATS ensures that most of the


764
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:10,466
application data sent over the


765
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:11,806
network is encrypted and


766
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:12,826
protected by default.


767
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:16,266
Basically, this means moving


768
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,656
away from insecure and legacy


769
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:19,816
HTP toward HTTPS.


770
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:22,166
And that means a couple things,


771
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:25,076
the first of which is to use the


772
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:26,506
latest standardized version TLS,


773
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:27,636
version 1.2.


774
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:29,556
This has been updated and


775
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:31,256
amended over the years to take


776
00:29:31,256 --> 00:29:32,846
into account some of the attacks


777
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:34,136
that Bailey eluded to earlier.


778
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:36,256
It also means using strong


779
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:36,886
cryptography.


780
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:39,306
That means using block cyphers


781
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:41,096
like AES and hash functions from


782
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:41,926
the SHA-2 family.


783
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:44,696
Importantly, it also means using


784
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,186
key exchange algorithms that


785
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,366
provide forward secrecy.


786
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:49,226
And this is an increasingly


787
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:50,566
important property in today's


788
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:54,156
day where the content of your


789
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:56,486
application's data as


790
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:58,386
transmitted over the network are


791
00:29:58,386 --> 00:29:59,926
kept save, even in the event


792
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:01,136
that the long-term private key


793
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:02,376
of a server is compromised.


794
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:05,566
Now, we live in a world where


795
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:07,276
not all TL servers are equal,


796
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,266
and moreover, not all TLS


797
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,806
servers use the same version or


798
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:11,586
configuration.


799
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:14,416
For example, you might have to


800
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,646
connect to an add server that


801
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:17,136
doesn't even support HTTPS.


802
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:18,976
So, what do you do?


803
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,136
This is where exceptions come


804
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:21,366
in.


805
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,696
Exceptions allow your app to opt


806
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:26,916
out of ATS enforcement for


807
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,496
particular domains, or globally


808
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,546
across your application.


809
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:33,916
Exceptions are intended to be


810
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,926
temporary to help you maintain


811
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,716
functionality while servers


812
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,456
upgrade to more modern TLS


813
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:40,426
configurations.


814
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:43,816
Last year, we announced plans to


815
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:45,486
start requiring justification


816
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,446
for exceptions in the app store.


817
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,706
And since then, we've heard that


818
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:51,946
the exceptions we had available


819
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:53,686
to you did not adequately meet


820
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:54,976
all of your use cases.


821
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:58,326
And since universal ATS adoption


822
00:30:58,326 --> 00:31:01,216
remains our primary goal, we've


823
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:03,056
taken that time to update the


824
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:03,866
exceptions that we have


825
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:05,846
available to you to meet and


826
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:07,206
satisfy these use cases.


827
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:08,766
And I want to dive into some


828
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,596
recent ones that were added in


829
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:11,076
the past.


830
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,536
Specifically, we've gone beyond


831
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:14,746
just acceptance for WebKit


832
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:15,196
content.


833
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:17,116
There are exceptions now to


834
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,916
ensure that if you are streaming


835
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,176
data through the AVFoundation


836
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:21,406
framework that happens to be


837
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:23,176
encrypted at rest, you can opt


838
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:24,516
out of ATS for that particular


839
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:24,856
data.


840
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:26,956
We also have exceptions to


841
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:29,456
support opting out of ATS for


842
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,876
arbitrary WebView request and


843
00:31:32,036 --> 00:31:33,706
opting out of ATS for local


844
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:34,546
network connections.


845
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:36,546
Here, local network connections


846
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,936
is just a connection made to a


847
00:31:37,936 --> 00:31:39,986
raw IP address, or a server with


848
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,286
an unqualified domain name.


849
00:31:42,516 --> 00:31:44,986
I want to be clear, even though


850
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,396
it may not be necessary for the


851
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:47,426
security and privacy of your


852
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:50,096
data to opt out of ATS, because


853
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:51,426
you have otherwise encrypted


854
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:52,676
your data before transmitting


855
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:53,046
it.


856
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:54,696
We still believe that the right


857
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,896
and proper thing to do is to use


858
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:58,316
TLS to protect your data in


859
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:58,766
transit.


860
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:00,936
That means as app developers,


861
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,166
and as Bailey already mentioned,


862
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:04,366
your goal should be to minimize


863
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,236
or remove exceptions where at


864
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:08,026
all possible, if it is within


865
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,496
your power to do so.


866
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:12,016
I also want to point out a


867
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:13,546
recent key that was added to


868
00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:14,406
support certificate


869
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:15,136
transparency.


870
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:18,126
If you want a particular server


871
00:32:18,126 --> 00:32:20,756
to opt into or participate in


872
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:22,256
certificate transparency to help


873
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:24,236
protect your apps, and users'


874
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,956
apps against certificate


875
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:29,396
[inaudible] attacks, you can


876
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:31,446
specify for a particular domain


877
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:32,696
whether or not you want that


878
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:35,766
server to participate in CT.


879
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,776
Now, we remain committed to ATS.


880
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:41,146
And in the past year we've


881
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,086
continued upgrading the services


882
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:44,436
that we make available to you as


883
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:45,606
developers, to make sure that


884
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:46,666
they are ATS compliant.


885
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:48,866
All the services you see here


886
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:50,966
are fully ATS compliant, meaning


887
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:51,936
that your apps will not have to


888
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,696
specify and exceptions when


889
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:54,366
talking to them.


890
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,606
You get best practice network


891
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:58,576
security out of the box, which


892
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,436
is the ultimate goal.


893
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:01,996
Now, also in this past year, we


894
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,686
kept an eye on the app store to


895
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:06,926
track and see how ATS adoption


896
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:08,386
is going.


897
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:10,696
We see adoption increasing.


898
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,186
We've also been seeing the


899
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:14,476
number of exceptions increasing.


900
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:15,796
Which means that there's still


901
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:16,746
more work to be done.


902
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:18,836
If you are an app developer,


903
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:21,036
continue to be vigilant and


904
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:23,306
remove, or minimize your reliant


905
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:24,026
on exceptions.


906
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:26,246
If you are a server operator or


907
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:29,146
owner, please continue upgrading


908
00:33:29,146 --> 00:33:30,366
your server configurations to


909
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,726
support 1.2 and more modern


910
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:35,216
versions of TLS.


911
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:39,486
Now, speaking of TLS, I want to


912
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:40,996
give you a brief glimpse into


913
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:42,226
the future of this critical


914
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:43,156
security protocol.


915
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,306
For those of you who don't know,


916
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:47,256
TLS is quickly becoming the


917
00:33:47,256 --> 00:33:48,106
[inaudible] of the internet.


918
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:49,996
More and more of your traffic is


919
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,616
protected on the wire thanks to


920
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:53,226
TLS, today.


921
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,226
However, not all traffic is


922
00:33:57,226 --> 00:33:58,066
protected the same.


923
00:33:59,026 --> 00:34:00,186
This protocol has been with us


924
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:01,926
for many, many years and there


925
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:02,576
are many different


926
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:03,726
implementations and


927
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,166
configurations of servers out


928
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,746
there supporting a wide variety


929
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:08,275
of TLS versions.


930
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:11,126
And over time the protocol has


931
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,616
been patched and amended to


932
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:13,835
generally address some of the


933
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,045
attacks that Bailey eluded to


934
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,166
earlier and just to fix up


935
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,176
general deficiency in the


936
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:18,646
protocol.


937
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,116
In recent years, the internet


938
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:22,056
community has taken it upon


939
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:22,996
themselves and deemed it


940
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,216
necessary to start working on


941
00:34:24,216 --> 00:34:25,096
the next version of this


942
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,436
critical protocol.


943
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:30,815
TLS 1.3. And in the spirit of


944
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:32,676
best practices, we are closely


945
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:33,976
tracking this work to ensure


946
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:35,755
that we are ready to adopt it


947
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,916
and help you adopt it when it


948
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,275
becomes a standard.


949
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:42,476
TLS 1.3 is truly best practice


950
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:43,126
by design.


951
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:45,485
All of the features, the


952
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:46,576
majority of the features that


953
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:47,876
are in ATS compliance


954
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,936
configurations are simply part


955
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:50,826
of the core standard.


956
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:54,136
That means legacy cryptographic


957
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,755
cipher suites, hash functions,


958
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:56,906
and key exchange algorithms are


959
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:58,316
simply not allowed.


960
00:34:58,606 --> 00:34:59,806
Not that you shouldn't use them,


961
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,246
they're just not there to begin


962
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:01,426
with.


963
00:35:02,496 --> 00:35:03,846
That means the specification is


964
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:04,996
overall much simpler.


965
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:06,726
Which means that it's easier to


966
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:08,996
implement, easier to reason


967
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:10,856
about, and most importantly


968
00:35:11,116 --> 00:35:11,956
easier to test.


969
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,736
And this gives us greater


970
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,036
confidence that the


971
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:17,096
implementation is free, or at


972
00:35:17,096 --> 00:35:19,926
least has very few problems that


973
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:21,256
have plagued TLS libraries in


974
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,836
the past.


975
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:25,626
As a result of this simplicity,


976
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:27,596
it also has improved network


977
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:28,246
efficiency.


978
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:30,126
And let me show you what I mean


979
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:31,786
by that.


980
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:32,836
Let's walk through a typical


981
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:35,976
handshake in TLS 1.2 and 1.3 to


982
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:37,116
establish a connection to a


983
00:35:37,116 --> 00:35:37,526
server.


984
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,796
We start with a TCP connection,


985
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:43,406
which requires one round trip


986
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:44,176
between the client and the


987
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:44,506
server.


988
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,026
Next step you start your TLS


989
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:48,906
handshake, where the client and


990
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:50,106
server exchange some hellos and


991
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,666
some initial centrifugation


992
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,476
information needed to proceed


993
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:55,546
with the rest of the connection.


994
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:58,806
In TLS 1.3, they actually start


995
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,756
also negotiating key material


996
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,256
used to encrypt the rest of the


997
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:05,476
traffic sent over that section,


998
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,066
which means that in the next


999
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,586
round, the client can start


1000
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,726
sending application data.


1001
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,536
In 1.2, the client and server


1002
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:14,466
are still negotiating key


1003
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,316
material, which means that


1004
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:18,896
requires one more round trip to


1005
00:36:18,896 --> 00:36:20,566
establish this session and start


1006
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:21,166
sending data.


1007
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:23,476
Now, this may not seem like a


1008
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:24,806
lot, but let me put it in


1009
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:25,596
perspective for you.


1010
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:27,786
We collect data from a wide


1011
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,356
variety of devices on different


1012
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,976
networks, both carrier, cellular


1013
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:34,416
and wi-fi around the world.


1014
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:36,866
And our data suggests that at


1015
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:38,426
least 10% of cellular


1016
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:41,566
connections, or at least 10% of


1017
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,846
TLS connections on cellular


1018
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:44,236
networks, rather, require at


1019
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,636
least 800 milliseconds to


1020
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,236
complete.


1021
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:49,206
And 10% of TLS connections on


1022
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:50,966
wi-fi networks take 500


1023
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:51,946
milliseconds to complete.


1024
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:55,566
TLS 1.3 would effectively shave


1025
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,676
1/3 of that time off, which is a


1026
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:00,906
huge win in mobile world.


1027
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:05,036
Now, TLS 1.3 is still very much


1028
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:05,966
a work in progress.


1029
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:08,156
And that's why ATS compliance is


1030
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:10,036
still focused on getting you to


1031
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:12,046
1.2, and ensuring that you're


1032
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:13,956
using the latest proper standard


1033
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:14,536
of the protocol.


1034
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:17,806
However, if you want to


1035
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,656
experiment with TLS 1.3 to


1036
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:20,636
prepare yourself for this


1037
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:22,396
protocol, I'm pleased to


1038
00:37:22,446 --> 00:37:24,706
announce that we can now allow


1039
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:25,376
you to do that.


1040
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:27,926
It is not on by default in any


1041
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:28,656
of our systems.


1042
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:31,036
However, if you opt into the


1043
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:33,576
seed and want to start


1044
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:35,176
experimenting with it, you can


1045
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:39,596
install a profile on iOS, or


1046
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,226
enable system wide TLS 1.3 on


1047
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,866
macOS with the simple defaults


1048
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:43,666
write.


1049
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:46,736
And you would do this to prime


1050
00:37:46,736 --> 00:37:47,916
your application and your


1051
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,716
network as the protocol marches


1052
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:51,056
toward standardization in the


1053
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:51,586
next year.


1054
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,396
And in the meantime, we're


1055
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,516
paying our due diligence and


1056
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:58,056
working with third parties and


1057
00:37:58,056 --> 00:37:59,286
with our enterprise partners to


1058
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:01,916
ensure their apps and their


1059
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:02,876
networks are ready for the


1060
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:04,746
adoption of the protocol as


1061
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:05,856
well.


1062
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:08,416
Now, I want to take a step back


1063
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,716
and come full circle with


1064
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,326
everything Bailey and I talked


1065
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:13,356
about today.


1066
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:15,556
One of our primary objectives is


1067
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:17,296
to help you keep your customers'


1068
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,446
data secure and private.


1069
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:20,696
And we do this by giving you


1070
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:21,676
best practice tools and


1071
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:23,116
technologies to help achieve


1072
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:23,716
that goal.


1073
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:26,326
However, you need to do some


1074
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:27,016
work yourself.


1075
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:29,256
And that means avoiding legacy


1076
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:30,816
or deprecated algorithms when at


1077
00:38:30,816 --> 00:38:31,496
all possible.


1078
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:33,666
And it also means continuing to


1079
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,686
upgrade to modern TLS


1080
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:35,546
configurations.


1081
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:37,726
If you're a server owner,


1082
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:39,916
operator, again, that means


1083
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:42,096
moving to 1.2 to make sure that


1084
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:44,406
every app that is ATS compliant


1085
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,016
can speak to you.


1086
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:47,356
If you're an app developer,


1087
00:38:47,356 --> 00:38:49,526
again, that means minimizing or


1088
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:51,066
reducing the use of exceptions.


1089
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,566
And if you're particularly


1090
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:55,366
adventurous, that means also


1091
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,976
trying out TLS 1.3 to prime your


1092
00:38:57,976 --> 00:38:59,956
application and your network for


1093
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:00,996
the next exciting version of


1094
00:39:00,996 --> 00:39:01,536
this protocol.


1095
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:05,736
If you'd like any more


1096
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:07,886
information on any of the topics


1097
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:09,306
that Bailey and I discussed, you


1098
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,326
can visit this link above.


1099
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,646
Next up in this room we have a


1100
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:15,026
session on privacy and your


1101
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,286
apps, which I highly encourage


1102
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:17,546
everyone to attend, given your


1103
00:39:17,546 --> 00:39:18,466
interest in security.


1104
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,586
Tomorrow we have two back to


1105
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:22,216
back jam packed sessions full of


1106
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:23,386
advances in networking, which


1107
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:25,396
would be very interesting and


1108
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,416
relevant to anyone at all who is


1109
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:28,176
interested in TLS.


1110
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:29,906
And that's all I have.


1111
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:31,266
Thank you for your time and


1112
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:32,896
attention, enjoy the rest of the


1113
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:33,536
conference.
