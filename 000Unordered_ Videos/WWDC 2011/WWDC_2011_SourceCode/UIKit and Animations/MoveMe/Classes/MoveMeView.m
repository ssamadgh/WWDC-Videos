	 This illustrates using UIView's built-in animation.  We want, though, to animate the same property (transform) twice -- first to scale up, then to shrink.  You can't animate the same property more than once using the built-in animation -- the last one wins.  So we'll set a delegate action to be invoked after the first animation has finished.  It will complete the sequence.
	 Note that we can pass information -- in this case, the using the context.  The context needs to be a pointer. A convenient way to pass a CGPoint here is to wrap it in an NSValue object.  However, the value returned from valueWithCGPoint is autoreleased.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue because typically if you need to use the value later you store it as an instance variable using an accessor method that retains it, or pass it to another object which retains it.  In this case, though, it's being passed as a void * parameter, and it's not retained by the UIView class.  By the time the delegate method is called, therefore, the autorelease pool will have been popped and the value would no longer be valid.  To address this problem, retain the value here, and release it in the delegate method.
