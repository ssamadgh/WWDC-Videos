00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,966
>> In the next 10 minutes, we


2
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,356
will learn how to use alerts to


3
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:27,366
make your app better, your users


4
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,596
happier, and your ratings and


5
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,616
revenues higher.


6
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:32,816
Good alerts can accomplish that


7
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,746
because they are one of the most


8
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,766
efficient problem-solving tools


9
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:37,976
at your disposal.


10
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:40,236
They help people enjoy your app,


11
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:42,986
and navigate it easily, instead


12
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,346
of getting stuck in some


13
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,306
suboptimal state, getting


14
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,976
frustrated, confused, quitting


15
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,606
your app, de-installing your


16
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:52,306
app, and giving you one-star


17
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:52,896
ratings.


18
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:56,096
So how do you create alerts that


19
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:56,386
work?


20
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:58,916
Before you get to the creating


21
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,846
part, you should ask yourself a


22
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:03,256
very important question.


23
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,006
Should I be using an alert at


24
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:06,516
all?


25
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,076
Is this the best way to achieve


26
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:09,666
my goal?


27
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:12,466
Let's look at some examples of


28
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:13,266
good alert use.


29
00:01:15,246 --> 00:01:16,626
The most common one you are


30
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,606
familiar with is to correct


31
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,086
errors, like this one.


32
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,836
Alerts are also used to request


33
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:27,306
access to user data, such as


34
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:30,156
contacts, location, or financial


35
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:30,966
information.


36
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,396
We provided a format for your


37
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:35,536
use, and put a lot of thought in


38
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,346
its content.


39
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:38,836
It explains concisely and


40
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,126
clearly what data is requested,


41
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:42,616
and how it will be used.


42
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:48,166
Alerts are also used to notify


43
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,906
people of major updates, such as


44
00:01:50,946 --> 00:01:53,146
significant feature releases, or


45
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,756
critical security fixes.


46
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:56,896
These announcements should be


47
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:59,096
used judiciously and sparingly.


48
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:02,326
Reserve them only for problems


49
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,096
that merit immediate attention


50
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,056
or features that would really


51
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,735
benefit your audience, certainly


52
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,395
not every update merits an


53
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,146
alert, and on that note, let's


54
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:14,646
talk about when alerts should


55
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:15,456
not be used.


56
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,616
I will introduce this topic with


57
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,546
a very important point I would


58
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:22,696
like you to remember.


59
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,886
Alerts are disruptive by design.


60
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:29,836
Oops, what are you doing here?


61
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:31,066
Can't you see I'm in the middle


62
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:31,646
of a talk?


63
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,246
Don't you wish you could do this


64
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:35,676
to all annoying alerts?


65
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,356
So the lesson here is, do not


66
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,146
use alerts for non-essential


67
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:40,866
content.


68
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:43,566
Before putting any content in an


69
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:46,616
alert, ask yourself, do people


70
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,556
really need to know this, and do


71
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,846
they need to know this now.


72
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,486
If the answer to that question


73
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,476
is not an absolute resounding


74
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,486
yes, do not interrupt your


75
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:56,986
audience.


76
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:01,376
The next important point I would


77
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,276
like you to remember is that


78
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,506
alerts are lightweight by


79
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:06,286
design.


80
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,566
Their small format reflects and


81
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,066
serves the purpose of


82
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,916
facilitating quick, informed


83
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,786
decisions, so that people can


84
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,836
make a choice, and move on with


85
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:19,026
whatever they were doing.


86
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:22,166
Therefore, do not overload


87
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,996
alerts with lengthy content, or


88
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,106
too many choices.


89
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:29,026
These tasks are better left to


90
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,456
larger UI elements.


91
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,506
Let's look at some examples.


92
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,296
Alerts are not settings, nor are


93
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:38,926
they multiple choice questions.


94
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:42,146
You can see that the actions are


95
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:43,416
struggling to fit into the


96
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,556
provided format, and here is a


97
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:46,416
hint for you.


98
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:49,126
If your alert takes most of the


99
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,276
supported view port, it is time


100
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,516
to cut down or relegate some of


101
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,526
the tasks to larger elements.


102
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,636
Alerts are full-scale diagnostic


103
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:01,086
tools.


104
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,286
Do not use them to expose


105
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,606
technical data, especially error


106
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:07,056
codes.


107
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,116
Alerts are not afterthoughts.


108
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,326
Do not use them to fix


109
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,516
preventable problems.


110
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:16,726
For example, if you have


111
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:19,116
password rules, articulate them


112
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:21,196
clearly on the main screen.


113
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,996
You can also disallow invalid


114
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:25,006
character input.


115
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,206
However, the thing to not do is


116
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,286
to make users memorize a long,


117
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,076
complicated list of characters,


118
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,096
and then go back to fix the


119
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,736
problem that should not have


120
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,126
occurred in the first place.


121
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,146
To summarize, the dos and don'ts


122
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:44,336
of alerts, use them to correct


123
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:46,686
errors, request access to


124
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,756
customer data, or notify people


125
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:50,906
of major updates.


126
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:54,026
Do not use them for


127
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,166
non-essential or lengthy


128
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:55,826
content.


129
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,816
Do not offer complicated


130
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:58,436
choices.


131
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,596
And do not duplicate the tasks


132
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,616
of other UI elements.


133
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,826
Now, you have considered all


134
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:07,926
these factors and decided that


135
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:09,336
you need an alert after all.


136
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:12,486
So how do you go about writing a


137
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:13,376
successful one?


138
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,016
It turns out that the structure


139
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,936
of the alert, with its clear


140
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:19,806
separation of visual elements


141
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:22,426
already sets you on this path of


142
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:22,876
success.


143
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,166
Let's go back to our good alert


144
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,736
example, and see how we can make


145
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,836
use of that structure.


146
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:34,596
In the title, state your main


147
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:37,096
point in one sentence or less.


148
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,746
In the message details, provide


149
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,546
brief additional information if


150
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:45,646
necessary, such as the cause of


151
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,436
the error, or the reason for


152
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,246
your request.


153
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:52,726
Offer actions that are easy to


154
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,076
understand and perform.


155
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,346
If you have to take people


156
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,326
outside the app, or to a


157
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,306
different state, make sure to


158
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:01,416
navigate them there.


159
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:03,416
Do not leave this job to the


160
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,226
Back button, the Home button,


161
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:07,656
the main screen, or otherwise


162
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,586
leave users to find their way.


163
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,446
If people scan the title and the


164
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,876
actions, ideally, they should be


165
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,446
able to understand what is going


166
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,196
on without paying too much


167
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,296
attention to the message


168
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:20,946
details.


169
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,646
While this is not always


170
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:24,666
possible, it is a good goal to


171
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,686
aspire to.


172
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,286
And if you need a quick mnemonic


173
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:31,876
rule, a good alert answers three


174
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:32,736
key questions.


175
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:34,276
What happened?


176
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:36,216
Why people are seeing this?


177
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,256
And how this should proceed


178
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,066
based on the information they've


179
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,616
received.


180
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:43,646
Now that you've mastered the


181
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,476
structure of the alert, let's


182
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:47,596
practice and apply these


183
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,286
guidelines to fix some common


184
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:49,826
problems.


185
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,476
Let's read through this one.


186
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:55,146
"App name" cannot open this


187
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:55,846
file.


188
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,886
The title is accurate, but not


189
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,006
especially helpful.


190
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:02,066
Which file do we mean?


191
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,606
People may be working with


192
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:04,496
multiple files.


193
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,446
You may need to download the


194
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:09,146
latest available updates for the


195
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:09,316
app.


196
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,156
Do you want to visit the "app


197
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:12,226
name" website for more


198
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,626
information and troubleshooting


199
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:13,956
tips?


200
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,706
These instructions are vague and


201
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,846
tentative, and suggest multiple


202
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,966
outcomes, and that is also a lot


203
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:21,626
of text.


204
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,946
No. Yes. The actions are


205
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,026
difficult to understand without


206
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:29,916
going back and reading said


207
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,996
lengthy instructions.


208
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:33,096
Let's see how we can improve


209
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:33,316
this.


210
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,696
First, let's specify the file


211
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,206
name for clarity.


212
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,416
Next, let's pare down the


213
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,386
instructions for simplicity.


214
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:49,016
Finally, let's offer clear


215
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:51,026
actionable choices, so that


216
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:52,656
people understand what happens


217
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:54,756
when they tap on any one of


218
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:55,116
them.


219
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,196
Here is your before and after.


220
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,226
Which one do you think looks


221
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:01,956
better?


222
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:02,606
Thought so.


223
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:06,616
Now, let's take a look at an


224
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,786
alert that seems to be written


225
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,436
with all the guidelines in mind.


226
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:12,776
Let's read through this one.


227
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,746
Cancel download?


228
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,026
If you cancel now, you will not


229
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,216
receive this file.


230
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,596
Cancel? Okay [laughter].


231
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,896
There is nothing wrong with any


232
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,796
individual part, the title


233
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:30,886
states the question, the message


234
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:33,186
describes the consequences, and


235
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,246
even the actions use the


236
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,736
recommended terminology.


237
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:38,726
Cancel and okay.


238
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,496
However, this is a classic


239
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:43,366
example of a confusing alert


240
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:45,666
that happens even to the most


241
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,006
experienced developers.


242
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:50,236
So the lesson here is, even when


243
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:52,226
using guidelines, always check


244
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:55,006
the result for any ambiguity or


245
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:55,816
confusion.


246
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:57,836
Let's see how we can clarify


247
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:58,396
this one.


248
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,626
First, let's rephrase the title


249
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,446
to remove ambiguity and mention


250
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:06,806
the filename to be more


251
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:07,456
specific.


252
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:11,426
Next, let's apply similar


253
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,066
changes to the message details.


254
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:16,276
And for good measure, let's


255
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:17,716
reiterate the choices and the


256
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,566
actions, so people understand


257
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,406
what happens if they click on


258
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,086
any of them.


259
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,466
Here is your before and after.


260
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:28,216
And I hope you would agree that


261
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,696
the after looks a bit better


262
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:30,406
than the before.


263
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,876
Now, you have learned how to


264
00:09:34,876 --> 00:09:37,246
make use of the structure, let's


265
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:38,406
talk a bit about style and


266
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,206
quality.


267
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,616
Here, I have a couple of tips


268
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:43,916
for you.


269
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,416
Avoid platitudes, jargon or


270
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:46,996
fillers.


271
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:48,896
All they do is take space


272
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,026
without adding any return value.


273
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,336
Use correct formatting,


274
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,406
spelling, and punctuation.


275
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,296
This seems like a very basic


276
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,386
piece of advice, but it will go


277
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,246
a very long way toward making


278
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:04,446
your alerts and your app look


279
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,106
polished and professional.


280
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,466
Finally, consider your audience.


281
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,146
Whether you are writing for


282
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,176
medical professionals, special


283
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:15,206
needs students, or even a very


284
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,066
smart cat who just learned how


285
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,746
to use an iPad, make sure that


286
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,756
your editorial voice matches


287
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,446
their needs and expectations.


288
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,366
In conclusion, here are the


289
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,786
three simple things you can do


290
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:31,496
now to make your alerts awesome.


291
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:34,906
Keep them simple and helpful.


292
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:37,206
Go practice.


293
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,436
Take what you learned, go


294
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,136
through your app, see if you


295
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,506
need all the alerts that you


296
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:45,386
created, and if you do, see how


297
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:46,836
you can make them work harder.


298
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,046
And for more information and an


299

website.


303
00:10:59,226 --> 00:10:59,616
Thank you.
