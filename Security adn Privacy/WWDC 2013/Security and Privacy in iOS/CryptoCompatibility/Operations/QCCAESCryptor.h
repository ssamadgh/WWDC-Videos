/*! Implements AES encryption and decryption without padding.
 *  \details In unpadded AES, both the input and output are an even multiple of 
 *      the AES block size (`kCCBlockSizeAES128`, or 16).  This supports both EBC and CBC 
 *      mode.
 *      
 *  \warning In most cases you will want to use AES in CBC mode; to do that securely, set the 
 *      initialisation vector (via the `ivData` property) to some cryptographically sound 
 *      random data.  If you need to use EBC mode, which is generally not recommended, set 
 *      the `ivData` property to nil.
 *      
 *  \note The designated initialiser for this class is private.  In the unlikely event you 
 *      need to subclass it, you will have to make that public.
