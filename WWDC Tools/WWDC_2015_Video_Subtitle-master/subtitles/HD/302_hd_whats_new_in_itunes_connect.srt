00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:26,406
>> DAVE VAN TASSELL:
Good morning.


3
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:28,656
Good morning.


4
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:31,016
Welcome to What's New
in iTunes Connect.


5
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:32,526
I am Dave Van Tassell,


6
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:35,016
Engineering Manager
here at iTunes Connect.


7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,246
I am excited to tell you what we
have been up to this past year


8
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:42,476
and where we are headed.


9
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,326
As many of you have noticed,


10
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:46,906
we started localizing iTunes
Connect over the past year.


11
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,766
We've added languages such
as Chinese, German, Japanese,


12
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,496
French, Spanish, Korean.


13
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:56,966
Just this week we added our
fourteenth language, Thai.


14
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:00,676
This is a long process, and
we are just getting started.


15
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:02,956
We can clap for localization.


16
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:03,836
That's okay.


17
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:07,196
[ Applause ]


18
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:09,026
As you sign in to
iTunes Connect,


19
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:11,896
we come to our Home page,
and I want to start today


20
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:16,196
by talking briefly about a few
of the areas we made changes in.


21
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:17,826
We are making changes
across the whole site.


22
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:18,976
We don't have time
for everything.


23
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:21,946
So let's start with
three to begin with.


24
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:24,076
The first is App Analytics.


25
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:27,366
We launched it earlier
this year,


26
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,146
and it's become the best place


27
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,136
to measure acquisition
to engagement.


28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,006
And it requires no
code from you,


29
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,536
all the while protecting your
and our customers' privacy.


30
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:42,306
If you have more questions
about App Analytics, what it is,


31
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:44,756
how it can help you, and
where we are going with that,


32
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,926
there's a great session right
after lunch, Getting the Most


33
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:51,396
Out of App Analytics,
with Tristan and David.


34
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:52,866
I highly recommend it.


35
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:57,876
The second area is
agreements, tax, and banking.


36
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:01,786
As you may have heard,
we've unified our agreement.


37
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,696
With one agreement,
you have access


38
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:06,176
to both the Mac and iOS SDKs.


39
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,856
You go to the dev
portal, sign in,


40
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:11,696
you agree to the
single agreement.


41
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:14,956
Come into iTunes Connect,
and you set up your tax


42
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:17,146
and banking information
just for that one contract,


43
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:18,596
letting you set up paid apps


44
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,366
and paid in-app purchases
for both Mac and iOS.


45
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:28,026
The third area I want to talk
about is resources and help.


46
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:32,056
We are overhauling our
support part of the site,


47
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,176
and the best part is
an integrated search.


48
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:38,146
This will work not only
across FAQs and guides,


49
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:40,256
but also the news
and announcements


50
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:43,406
for iTunes Connect,
both past and current.


51
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:47,236
And to make this even better,
we are integrating our guides


52
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,946
as web pages as opposed
to downloadable PDFs.


53
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:52,866
We are going to move all
of this content outside


54
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:56,586
of the iTunes Connect login
so you can access it and link


55
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:59,946
to these pages from
wherever you want.


56
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:05,366
[ Applause ]


57
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,486
For the rest of the
presentation, we want to focus


58
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:11,066
on two other areas, My
Apps and users and roles.


59
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:13,196
Let's start with My Apps.


60
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:18,256
We are introducing a cleaner
organization to the tabs inside


61
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,736
of My Apps, as well
as a pricing redesign,


62
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:23,656
and some TestFlight updates.


63
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:26,496
So starting with
the organization.


64
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:30,806
Today iTunes Connect is broken
into seven distinct tabs:


65
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:37,576
Versions, Pricing, Prerelease,
In-App Purchases, Game Center,


66
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,186
Reviews, and Newsstand.


67
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,856
And we want to simplify
this a little bit.


68
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:43,366
First off, we are going


69
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,836
to create a new tab called App
Store, and we are going to put


70
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,246
in your version information,


71
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:49,426
pricing information,
as well as reviews.


72
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,636
Then we are going to move
all the In-App Purchases,


73
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:55,136
Game Center, and
Newsstand features


74
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:57,046
into a tab called Features.


75
00:03:57,476 --> 00:04:01,736
Second, we are going to
take Prerelease and split it


76
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,206
into its two distinct areas:


77
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,276
TestFlight for managing
your internal


78
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:08,816
and external tester
information as well


79
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,886
as your TestFlight
builds, and also Activity,


80
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:14,196
where you can get information
on all of your builds,


81
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:15,856
whether they went
through TestFlight or not,


82
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:24,546
as well as your version status
history and Resolution Center.


83
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:27,336
Looking more into App Store,
in your version information,


84
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,266
there's a lot of metadata


85
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:31,026
to get your app ready
for the App Store.


86
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:35,046
Some of this information, it
changes from version to version


87
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:37,436
to version, such as
your What's New text,


88
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,746
your description,
or your screenshots.


89
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,216
Other information
tends to stay the same,


90
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,626
your app name, categories, EULA.


91
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:49,996
We want to break this into two
separate lists, your app info


92
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,216
and your version information.


93
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:54,206
Both of these lists
will be reviewed


94
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,866
with each version
submission, but we are going


95
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:58,586
to separate two distinct
areas under App Store,


96
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:00,276
App Info and Versions.


97
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:05,606
Next under Versions, I want
to talk about version release.


98
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,716
When you submit your
app to App Review,


99
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:11,996
you decide what happens
after it's approved.


100
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:15,266
You can have automatically
release as soon


101
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,986
as App Review has
approved your version.


102
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,176
We begin processing for
App Store right away


103
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,086
and enter Ready for Sale.


104
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:25,606
Alternatively, you can choose
to manually release your app.


105
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:28,356
When you do this, after App
Review has approved your app,


106
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,166
it goes into Pending
Developer Release.


107
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,446
At this point, you can
continue to invite internal


108
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:36,356
and external testers
through TestFlight;


109
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:40,506
you can request promo codes,
and they will download this new


110
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,576
and improved version as
opposed to the one live


111
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,806
in the App Store; and if
you find any critical bugs,


112
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:50,386
you can dev reject your app,
fix the bug, upload and submit,


113
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:51,406
and put it back into the system.


114
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:53,796
Whenever you are ready
to release your app,


115
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:56,196
you log into iTunes
Connect, and you decide


116
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:58,486
at what point it begins
processing for App Store


117
00:05:58,486 --> 00:05:59,396
and enter ready for sale.


118
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,186
We are adding a third
new option,


119
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,826
which is called Scheduled
Release, and for this,


120
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:08,306
you can choose the date and
time when your app will move


121
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:09,376
through processing
for App Store.


122
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,346
[ Applause ]


123
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:15,036
So just like manual
release, after it's approved,


124
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:16,626
it's going to go into
Pending Developer Release,


125
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:22,556
but instead of you logging into
iTunes Connect, we'll move it


126
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,956
for you at that given
date and time.


127
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:26,506
And iTunes Connect is
going to look like this


128
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,376
under the Version tab.


129
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:30,646
Come in here and
select which option


130
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,146
of version release
control you want.


131
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:38,726
So we now have three choices.


132
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:43,636
Automatically release goes
as soon as it's approved.


133
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:48,056
The second is a manual release,
you log into iTunes Connect


134
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,306
and click "release
this version,"


135
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,786
and the third is a scheduled
release, where after approval


136
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:57,746
and after your selected date
and time, then we release it


137
00:06:57,746 --> 00:06:58,776
for processing to App Store.


138
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:03,786
Let's talk about
some pricing updates.


139
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:05,856
Longtime users of
iTunes Connect,


140
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,446
you know we haven't made
a lot of changes to the UI


141
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:09,856
on the pricing section.


142
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:15,996
So along with a general redesign
of this page, I want to call


143
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:17,806
out some more subtle
features we are adding.


144
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:21,636
The first is in selecting
your tier.


145
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:25,916
We are going to add in the
customer price into the tier


146
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,376
in your preferred currency.


147
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:29,946
What is a preferred currency?


148
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:32,696
This is an iTunes Connect user
setting where you can choose


149
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,896
which currency we are going to
show in that tiered drop-down.


150
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,786
We are going to start it based
off of your contract location,


151
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:42,656
but you can log into iTunes
Connect and change it anytime.


152
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:47,546
Once you've selected your
currency, you can view


153
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:51,226
that same tier and all
the other currencies.


154
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:54,656
We've also made a
change to the All Prices


155
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:55,566
and Currencies section.


156
00:07:56,136 --> 00:08:00,076
Here you can select up to
five different currencies


157
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:05,336
and see them side by side on the
screen, across all of the tiers


158
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:06,576
for these five currencies.


159
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:09,246
With that, I want to invite
Jennifer Stuart onto the stage,


160
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:10,666
and she is going to
give us a demo of some


161
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,536
of these new features
in iTunes Connect.


162
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:12,856
Jennifer [Applause].


163
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:13,776
>> JENNIFER STUART: Hi.


164
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:14,406
I'm Jennifer.


165
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:16,006
I am going to walk
you through some


166
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:17,876
of the changes we have
coming up in iTunes Connect.


167
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:21,616
So I have an app in the
App Store, and according


168
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:23,956
to App Analytics, it's
doing really well in Italy,


169
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:25,776
but I think I can
do even better,


170
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,056
and localizing my app
will really do the job,


171
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:29,646
so I am going to
do three things.


172
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:33,876
The first thing I am going to
do is boost my marketing efforts


173
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,836
by localizing my app in Italian.


174
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:40,216
The second thing I am going to
do is carefully time the release


175
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:42,446
of this new version to coincide


176
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,526
with some other marketing
efforts I have in place.


177
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:48,136
The third thing I am going to
do is set up a special price


178
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,196
for the week of this
new release.


179
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:50,556
So let's get started.


180
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,946
Okay. So we are starting off
at the My Apps page here,


181
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:03,116
and I can see - I'm
going to go into my apps.


182
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:06,046
I can see my app here,
TouchFighter III.


183
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,686
I will click on it.


184
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,236
As Dave explained,


185
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,246
app information has
the metadata fields


186
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:14,736
that get updated
less frequently,


187
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,826
so these fields are
now on their own page.


188
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:19,596
Our first task is to
create a new localization.


189
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:22,036
I am going to click on the
locale here on the right,


190
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:26,046
and that will show
us localizations


191
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,096
that we have been set up for.


192
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:30,346
You will see that Italian
is not in this list,


193
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,686
and I can't create it just yet.


194
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,376
I will need to create
a new version.


195
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,136
So on the left nav here, I am
going to click on New Version.


196
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:41,766
We get a modal asking for
a new store version number.


197
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:47,506
I am going to give it 1.0.3,
and then click Create.


198
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:54,486
This will create the
new version for my app,


199
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:55,876
and I will also be brought right


200
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:57,316
to the version's
specific details.


201
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:09,406
I have my English text
ready for What's New.


202
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:14,996
And now I am ready to create
my Italian localization.


203
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:17,736
I will click on the
locale here and scroll


204
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:18,796
down and find Italian.


205
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:23,676
And that adds my localization.


206
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:26,316
I have my What's New text
also for that ready to go.


207
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,876
So the next thing I wanted


208
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,376
to do was carefully time the
release of this new version.


209
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,476
So I am going to scroll
down to version release,


210
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,016
which is towards the
bottom of the page.


211
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,476
So before we just had the two
options, manual and automatic.


212
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:51,216
With manual release, after my
app was approved by App Review,


213
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:53,676
I would need to remember to
come in on the day I wanted


214
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,056
to release my app
to the App Store.


215
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,886
With automatic, it would release
automatically, but maybe not


216
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:00,366
on the exact day
I had planned for.


217
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:04,896
So with this new option, I
can set up a date and time


218
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:08,346
for when I want it to release,
and it will move to Processing


219
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:10,476
for App Store on
that date and time.


220
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:11,966
After App Review.


221
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:15,946
So I am going to select July
1 here in the date drop-down.


222
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:25,676
And this is based on my local
date and time, just so you know


223
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:27,436
that when you are setting
that up for your app.


224
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,926
So I think everything
looks good here,


225
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:40,476
so I am going to click on Save.


226
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,996
And the last thing I wanted to
do was set up a special price


227
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,826
for this new version's
launch date.


228
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:47,256
To do that, I am going
to click on Pricing


229
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:49,466
and Availability
in the left nav.


230
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:53,436
You will see we have
this All Prices


231
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:54,856
and Currencies link
on the right.


232
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,446
I am going to click
and open that up.


233
00:11:58,246 --> 00:11:59,956
So I can take a look
at all the price tiers


234
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:02,206
and what the price tier
will be in each storefront,


235
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:04,496
and I can change what
storefronts I'm comparing


236
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:06,316
by clicking on the
storefront name at the top.


237
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:08,916
I am going to go and
select Italy here


238
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:14,746
to see how the different tiers
compare in that storefront.


239
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:16,836
And I can see my
proceeds as well.


240
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:21,056
So I think I know which
tier I am going to move


241
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:22,546
to for my special price.


242
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:23,686
I am going to close this window.


243
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:28,586
And now I am going to click
on Plan a Price Change.


244
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:34,896
And here, under Price, I
am going to select Tier 1.


245
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:37,826
And you will see that we have
this Other Currencies link here


246
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:42,356
below, and now I can see what
this tier will look like,


247
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:45,456
what the price will be, and
what my proceeds will be


248
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:46,886
in each storefront
for this tier.


249
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:52,446
So again, we have our marketing
plan going on for July 1,


250
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:56,406
so I will go ahead and select
July 1 here, and we are going


251
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:58,646
to run this special
price for a week.


252
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,466
So I am going to go
and select July 8


253
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:03,616
and the end date
and then click Done.


254
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:09,556
So you can see that the app
will go on sale on July 1


255
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:12,046
and then return to its original
price at the end of the week.


256
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,436
This all looks good to me,
so I am going to go ahead


257
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:15,946
and click Save at
the top corner.


258
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,526
So that completes
all our main tasks.


259
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:21,686
And just so you are aware,


260
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:24,786
everything I've done just now
can also be done via XML feed.


261
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,996
If you'd like to learn more
about how to make these kinds


262
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,666
of updates via XML, check


263
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,726
out the session called
iTunes Connect: Development


264
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,026
and Distribution at 3:30
in the Mission Room.


265
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,666
There will be a portion
of that session


266
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,756
that covers this process.


267
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:39,096
Now I will walk you through
some additional changes we have


268
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:39,916
in iTunes Connect.


269
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,636
I am going to go
under Features tab.


270
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,736
If I have an in-app
purchase that I want


271
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:50,316
to also add a localization
to, I can go to Features


272
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:53,206
and In-App Purchases, and this
will list my in-app purchases


273
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:56,966
that I have for this app, and I
can create new ones by clicking


274
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,696
on the plus symbol next to
the header, or I can click


275
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:01,266
on the name to add
the localization.


276
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:05,546
As well, we have Game Center
under Features as well.


277
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,836
And here I can see my
leaderboards and achievements


278
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:11,316
and create new ones by
clicking the plus symbol next


279
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:11,756
to the header.


280
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,626
We also have Newsstand
in this section.


281
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,806
If this was a Newsstand app,


282
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,476
I can manage my Newsstand
issues there.


283
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:22,156
I can also see the builds I
have uploaded under Activity.


284
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:24,116
These are the builds
I have uploaded


285
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,606
for each version
would be shown here.


286
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:30,296
As Dave mentioned, we've
also updated the Resources


287
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:33,046
and Help section, so
let's take a look at that.


288
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:47,276
So you don't even need to be
logged into iTunes Connect now


289
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,216
to access this content.


290
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:50,026
There's four main sections here.


291
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:52,236
In the News section, you
can read about updates


292
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,026
to iTunes Connect and the latest
information about the App Store.


293
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,676
There's a Video section
where I can watch tutorials


294
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:58,856
and feature walkthroughs.


295
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:01,246
You can find style
guides, checklists,


296
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:03,076
and sample content
in the Guide section.


297
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:07,106
Lastly, look for your answers to
your questions in the FAQ area.


298
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:09,616
Most recently updated
questions will get badged,


299
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,936
so you can easily find those.


300
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,926
The great thing is we
have a Search field here


301
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:15,626
that will search
across all the areas,


302
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:18,616
and you can find exactly what
you need easy and quickly.


303
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:22,276
So I am going to type in
Trends and see what we got.


304
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:26,116
So you can see we get responses
from all the different areas.


305
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,116
So that gives you a little
preview of what we have coming


306
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:30,576
up for iTunes Connect,
and with that,


307
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,726
I will give the floor
back to Dave.


308
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:41,336
[ Applause ]


309
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:42,756
>> DAVE VAN TASSELL:
Thank you, Jennifer.


310
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:45,486
We are excited about
these changes


311
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,946
that we're making
to iTunes Connect.


312
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:50,626
Let's talk a little
bit about TestFlight.


313
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:54,466
One person likes TestFlight.


314
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,146
[Applause] There we go.


315
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,826
We launched TestFlight
last year,


316
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,396
and it quickly became
the best place


317
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,136
to beta test your iOS apps.


318
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,576
No provisioning profile
is required.


319
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:09,436
We automatically generate
the sandbox accounts


320
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,726
for your in-app purchase
testing.


321
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:13,916
And with the release of
Apple Watch this year,


322
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:16,296
TestFlight also supports
Apple Watch.


323
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:19,716
And there's two kinds of
testers for TestFlight.


324
00:16:19,716 --> 00:16:21,606
You have your internal
and external testers.


325
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,056
I want to talk a little bit


326
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,246
about the differences
between those.


327
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,476
So your first is internal.


328
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:32,186
Internal testers are your
fellow iTunes Connect users.


329
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:33,556
They are part of your team.


330
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,706
You invite them to TestFlight


331
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:37,166
with their iTunes
Connect user name.


332
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,646
But when they accept their
invitation, they accept it


333
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:41,956
with their personal
App Store account.


334
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:43,886
It doesn't have to be the same


335
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,016
as their iTunes Connect
user name.


336
00:16:46,026 --> 00:16:48,686
There's no beta app review
for internal testing.


337
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,856
For external testers, all
you need is an email address,


338
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:56,716
and again, when they accept
their TestFlight invitation,


339
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,146
they will do so with their
personal App Store account,


340
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:00,646
which can be a different email


341
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,556
than the one you
invited them with.


342
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,886
With external testing,


343
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:09,465
we do require beta app
review with new versions.


344
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:11,996
What are new versions?


345
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:14,506
Let's talk about that.


346
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:18,746
There are two keys that are
important in Xcode when talking


347
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,665
about TestFlight,
versions, and builds.


348
00:17:21,136 --> 00:17:23,486
The first is your CFbundle
short version string.


349
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:25,106
This is your version.


350
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,136
And the second is the CFbundle
version, or your build.


351
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:32,456
So when you select a build
to go into external testing,


352
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,486
let's go with version 1.0,
build 100, this is going to go


353
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:39,066
through beta app review.


354
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:41,726
As you upload and
submit subsequent builds


355
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,176
to the same version, we ask,


356
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,036
have you made any
significant changes?


357
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,576
And if you haven't made
any significant changes,


358
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:51,396
then the beta app review
process is much quicker


359
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:52,046
for these builds.


360
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:56,326
Once you are ready to start
inviting external testers


361
00:17:56,586 --> 00:18:00,786
to a new version -- in
this case, version 1.1 --


362
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:04,436
this version will go through
the same kind of beta app review


363
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:10,156
that your initial build on
version 1.0 went through.


364
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:13,136
Another difference between
internal and external testing is


365
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:16,686
which build is available
for your testers.


366
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:20,926
So for internal here,
we have version 1.0,


367
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:25,046
and it's the latest build, build
101, that is always available


368
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:26,106
for your internal testers.


369
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:30,016
As we switch to testing
version 1.1,


370
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,206
the last build we've uploaded,
103, is what's available.


371
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:36,876
If I upload a new build, it will
automatically be distributed


372
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:37,836
to the internal testers.


373
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:42,886
Whereas for external
testers, you get to select


374
00:18:43,126 --> 00:18:46,166
which build they see, so we
can start with build 100,


375
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:52,236
move on to build 102, all the
while our internal testers were


376
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:54,496
a little bit later
on in build 103.


377
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,396
I'd like to turn the time
over to Jason Gregori.


378
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,236
He is going to give us a
demo of TestFlight and talk


379
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:02,616
about some new features there.


380
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:03,346
Jason?


381
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:08,796
[ Applause ]


382
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:09,706
>> JASON GREGORI: Thanks, Dave.


383
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:10,826
Hi, everyone.


384
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:11,956
My name is Jason.


385
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,286
I am going to give you a
quick preview of what's coming


386
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,776
with TestFlight in iOS 9.


387
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:20,716
Okay. Let's get started
with the new TestFlight tab


388
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:21,406
in iTunes Connect.


389
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:25,526
To get there from the My
Apps page, click on your app,


390
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:30,366
and then click on
the TestFlight tab.


391
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:32,516
Right away, you can see internal


392
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,306
and external testing
have been broken


393
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,726
into their own separate
sections.


394
00:19:36,596 --> 00:19:39,176
Not only does this help with
clarity, it also allows you


395
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,476
to give two completely
different versions of your app


396
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:43,286
to your internal and
external testers.


397
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,006
Here in the internal
testing section,


398
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,016
you can see the current
build being tested,


399
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:51,066
your internal testers,
and their current status.


400
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:54,786
After you've selected the
version of your app you want


401
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:59,426
to beta test, internal testers
will always get the latest build


402
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:02,316
sent to them automatically
without beta review.


403
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:06,676
That means once you set internal
testing up, you don't even have


404
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:07,876
to come to iTunes
Connect at all.


405
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:12,146
New builds uploaded to iTunes
Connect just automatically go


406
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,466
out to your internal testers.


407
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,266
To change the current version
you want your internal testers


408
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,096
to see, click on the Select
link over on the right.


409
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,096
Here you can choose
which version


410
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,296
of your app internal
testing gets builds from.


411
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,846
Remember that the
version number comes


412
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:32,106
from your app's CFbundle
short version string,


413
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:35,076
and the build number comes
from its CFbundle version.


414
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,076
Down below you can
see your testers.


415
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:42,916
You can see a little
information about them


416
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,406
and whether they've
accepted your invite


417
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,366
or installed your app.


418
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:49,126
You can also add or
edit testers from here.


419
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:53,326
Let's add another tester.


420
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:56,756
Everyone eligible for
testing but not yet invited


421
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,736
to the app shows up here.


422
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:03,156
Remember, you only have
up to 25 internal testers,


423
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,896
and for someone to be
eligible, they must be


424
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,096
on your iTunes Connect team.


425
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:11,456
Let's add Eric.


426
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:15,726
After I add and save, Eric
will get an invite sent right


427
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:16,306
to his inbox.


428
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:23,246
Over on the external
testing side,


429
00:21:23,806 --> 00:21:26,586
you'll see your currently
testable builds as well


430
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,576
as your external testers.


431
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,846
The great thing about
external testing is


432
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:33,696
that you get a thousand tester
slots, and to add a tester,


433
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,166
all you need is an
email address.


434
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,316
There are some new changes
to external testing.


435
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:42,756
One, you can now give your
external testers a completely


436
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:45,176
different version of your app
than your internal testers.


437
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,326
Which is great for letting
external testers test the latest


438
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:50,816
minor update while
internal testers are


439
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:51,696
on the next big release.


440
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:55,186
And two, you can now
submit a version of your app


441
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:58,266
to beta review while your
external testers continue


442
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,046
to test a different
version of your app.


443
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:05,506
[ Applause ]


444
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:09,386
Okay. Let's look at adding
a new version to test.


445
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:12,056
Clicking the Add link brings
me to the build chooser.


446
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,966
Notice I am specifying exactly


447
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,446
which build external
testers will get.


448
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:21,026
Let's add this build.


449
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:24,006
We are immediately taken
to a submission page


450
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:25,516
for this specific build.


451
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:30,046
Unlike for internal testing,
external testers always get What


452
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:32,966
to Test information,
an app description,


453
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:34,686
and a feedback email address.


454
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:41,236
Next up, export compliance.


455
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:43,436
Don't you wish you could
just skip this page?


456
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,266
Well, now you can.


457
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,656
Dave will show you later
in this presentation.


458
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,016
But for now, I will just
answer the question.


459
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:58,626
After submitting,
we are taken back


460
00:22:58,656 --> 00:22:59,816
to the external testing page,


461
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:02,026
and we can see our new
build is in review.


462
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:06,716
Notice how even though I have
a new build in beta review,


463
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:08,466
my testers still have access


464
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,376
to the build they were
previously testing.


465
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,536
I can even swap out the build


466
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:14,186
for one that's already
been approved.


467
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:20,266
Let's add an external tester.


468
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:29,036
I'm going to add my friend Ben.


469
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:32,206
All I need to add Ben
is his email address.


470
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:36,036
I want to again point out here
that the email address you use


471
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:38,706
for a tester does not
have to be their Apple ID.


472
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:41,166
Any email address
they have access


473
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,656
to on their iOS device
is perfectly valid.


474
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:47,486
Once they accept the invite,
your app will become linked


475
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:49,206
to their logged-in Apple ID.


476
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:51,816
What this means for
you is don't worry


477
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,326
about which email
address you use.


478
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:59,366
Now, I just save,
confirm, and I am done.


479
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,196
The invite is sent.


480
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:03,556
Now, you might be
asking yourself,


481
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:05,646
where do all the old builds go?


482
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,736
I am glad you asked that.


483
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:14,106
[Laughter] They go to the
TestFlight build section.


484
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:17,656
The build section includes
not just the old builds


485
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,746
but every single build
you've added to TestFlight.


486
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:23,506
You can view each build's
current internal status,


487
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:26,646
external status, and the number
of times it was installed.


488
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:31,476
Click on a build, and you can
see even more information,


489
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:37,566
including who tested it and
detailed technical information.


490
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,366
All right.


491
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:43,896
Let's move on to
the TestFlight app.


492
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:47,886
Here's an invite for our app.


493
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:52,926
Right in the email, I get this
nice, big Start Testing button.


494
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,946
Now, if I don't have
the TestFlight app,


495
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:58,016
tapping Start Testing
will take me


496
00:24:58,016 --> 00:24:59,326
to the App Store to install it.


497
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:02,776
Or if I am in a third-party
browser or email client,


498
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:05,186
I will get options to
install or open TestFlight.


499
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,936
Since I already have
TestFlight installed,


500
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:12,296
it's going to take me straight
into the TestFlight app,


501
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:15,296
where I can view and install the
beta, which I will do right now.


502
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:21,076
Since this beta supports Apple
Watch, I get this Watch bar app


503
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:24,976
at the top, which lets me
install the WatchKit app right


504
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:29,336
onto my Watch right
from in TestFlight.


505
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:35,606
TestFlight will support both
watchOS 1 and watchOS 2 apps


506
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:38,766
and will install the best app
supported by the user's Watch.


507
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:43,776
I am happy to report TestFlight
will also auto-install beta


508
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,786
WatchKit apps if
that's your preference.


509
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:52,366
We are also adding a new
screen for incompatible apps.


510
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:55,506
When a tester has a device
that doesn't support your app,


511
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:57,166
they'll now get a new screen,


512
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,696
which helps explain
what's going on.


513
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:04,716
Here's an iPad app with
instructions on how to get it.


514
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:07,346
Open TestFlight on your
iPad, much more obvious.


515
00:26:10,156 --> 00:26:12,506
Another change we are making
is adding more control


516
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:13,466
over notifications.


517
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:15,356
Down at the bottom of this page,


518
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,416
there's a new Notifications
button.


519
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:21,336
Some people prefer to
get only email updates,


520
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:23,766
some prefer to get only
push notifications,


521
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:27,376
and in the new notifications
menu, you can choose


522
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:30,716
to turn push notifications
and email notifications on


523
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,016
or off on a per-app basis.


524
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:35,896
And there you have it.


525
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:37,916
Back to you, Dave.


526
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:47,516
[ Applause ]


527
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:48,976
>> DAVE VAN TASSELL:
Thank you, Jason.


528
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:52,786
I want to recap one of the
changes that Jason talked about,


529
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:56,126
and this is about your
internal and external testers.


530
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,376
The ability to let your
internal testers be working


531
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:02,856
on one version -- in
this case, version 1.1 --


532
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:06,166
and your external testers
can then be invited


533
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,026
to a completely separate
version, version 1.0.


534
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:13,566
Some other changes we
will be rolling out are


535
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,236
about the metrics
for TestFlight.


536
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:20,096
Today we support installs,
counts across your builds


537
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,716
and versions, and we will be
rolling out the same metrics


538
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:28,006
for sessions across builds and
versions as well as crashes


539
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:30,976
at your build and version level.


540
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:36,356
[ Applause ]


541
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:39,286
And all three of these metrics
will also be able to show you


542
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:41,546
at the tester level,
so you can then see


543
00:27:41,546 --> 00:27:43,256
which testers are
having the most success


544
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:46,026
and which testers are having the
most problems, and you can reach


545
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:48,806
out to them with that same
email address they gave you


546
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,066
when you invited
them to TestFlight.


547
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:54,926
In iTunes Connect,
it looks like this.


548
00:27:55,956 --> 00:28:00,556
You can see those numbers for
installs, sessions, and crashes.


549
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:08,456
I'd also like to talk about
some new TestFlight limits.


550
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:12,726
Currently, you can upload two
builds a day, and we are going


551
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:14,926
to bump that up to six
external builds a day.


552
00:28:16,476 --> 00:28:19,016
We also want to increase the
number of apps you can have


553
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,636
in active TestFlight
from 10 to 100.


554
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:26,346
[ Applause ]


555
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:28,116
That one was worth
clapping about [Laughter].


556
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:32,096
Build expiration,
we are going to bump


557
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:33,846
that up from 30 to 60 days.


558
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:37,296
[ Applause ]


559
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:42,026
Internal testers, 25 unique user
names per account, we are going


560
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:44,756
to change that to
25 users per app.


561
00:28:45,046 --> 00:28:49,006
And then for internal testing,
we want to go from 1,000


562
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:51,176
to 2,000 external
testers per app.


563
00:28:52,016 --> 00:28:55,566
[ Applause ]


564
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,386
Today for TestFlight,
you can TestFlight all


565
00:28:58,386 --> 00:28:59,426
of your iOS 8 apps.


566
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:02,466
Also with Monday's
C1 release of iOS 9,


567
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:05,016
you can invite your internal
testers to test those apps,


568
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:09,066
and we have Apple
Watch support 1.0.


569
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:12,136
Later this summer, we will be
extending iOS 9 beta testing


570
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:14,846
to external testers,
as well as watchOS 2,


571
00:29:14,846 --> 00:29:17,636
and we will begin
supporting app thinning


572
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:20,656
and ODR support natively with
the App Store infrastructure


573
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:23,446
that you will be using when
your customers get their hands


574
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:25,086
on these same apps.


575
00:29:26,616 --> 00:29:28,276
Those are our changes
to TestFlight,


576
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:32,426
but as Jason mentioned, we
have a change around encryption


577
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:33,756
and export compliance.


578
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,896
We have added a new
tab under Features.


579
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:40,766
Today, when you submit your
app, whether it's for beta


580
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:42,126
or for the App Store, we ask,


581
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,506
does your app use
any encryption?


582
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:48,236
And based on the encryption
that you use, we require upload


583
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:49,756
of export compliance
documentation.


584
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:53,066
So we are going to
add a new plist key


585
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,546
in Xcode called ITS app
uses nonexempt encryption.


586
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:02,086
Enter False in here, and that
will let us know what kind


587
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:03,296
of encryption that you use.


588
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:07,816
If your app does use nonstandard
encryption, answer Yes.


589
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:10,356
And then you can go back
into iTunes Connect,


590
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:12,716
tell us about the encryption,


591
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:16,786
upload the correct export
compliance ERN documents,


592
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,566
and we are going
to give you a code.


593
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:23,146
With that code, you can
enter that into Xcode


594
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:27,636
with the plist key ITS
encryption export compliance


595
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:30,566
code, and we will link
the encryption you told us


596
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:33,856
about in iTunes Connect with the
build that you are uploading,


597
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:36,036
and you can reuse this code
across many different builds


598
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:39,436
to let us know the form of
encryption you are using.


599
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:42,556
If you change your encryption,
log back into iTunes Connect,


600
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:45,326
let us know about it, upload
the correct documentation,


601
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:47,516
we will give you another code,
and you can use that code


602
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:50,036
with the builds that support
this new version of encryption.


603
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:54,796
And those are our
changes to My Apps.


604
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:59,686
I want to talk about
users and roles,


605
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:03,076
and there's three new features
we are going to be introducing.


606
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:06,526
The first is account switching,
the ability to use one user name


607
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:08,176
to log into multiple accounts.


608
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:12,086
[ Applause ]


609
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,976
The second is app siloing,
where you can separate


610
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:16,706
which apps different
users can see.


611
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,216
[ Applause ]


612
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:22,346
And the third are some
new users and roles


613
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:23,636
to help with these features.


614
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:26,256
Let's start with
account switching.


615
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:29,126
As you log in, you
have your user name,


616
00:31:29,126 --> 00:31:31,656
you log into your account,
and as you get access to more


617
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,966
and more accounts, you create
new user names for each account.


618
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:37,916
With account switching,
you'll be able


619
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,686
to use a single user name to log


620
00:31:39,686 --> 00:31:41,616
into all these different
accounts.


621
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:45,226
But with each account, you have
different apps that you see,


622
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,236
you have different roles.


623
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:50,456
So we will make it so that as
you log in and you can switch


624
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,516
which account that
you want to view,


625
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,146
will change those
apps that you see.


626
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:59,076
You will get those roles and
permissions that you have


627
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,946
for the account that
you've now moved to.


628
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:02,986
And that's account switching.


629
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:10,456
Every account starts with
one user, your admin user.


630
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:16,696
As you start adding more and
more apps to this account,


631
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:19,456
you start adding
more and more users.


632
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:22,646
Most of these users
are technical users,


633
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:26,946
but what you found is you want
some users to see some apps


634
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:29,086
and some users to
see other apps.


635
00:32:29,086 --> 00:32:32,636
So what we are going to do is
we are going to separate this


636
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:34,886
into three different areas.


637
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,836
We also realize that Technical
User is a little bit broad,


638
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:41,726
so we are going to
deprecate Technical


639
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,216
with a new role called
App Manager.


640
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:47,836
This App Manager will be
able to manage these apps


641
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:49,946
in iTunes Connect for you.


642
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:54,046
We are going to add two new
roles, Developer and Marketer,


643
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:55,406
to help out with this.


644
00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:57,146
Let's talk about what
these roles entail.


645
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:01,706
In App Manager, they will
be able to create users,


646
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:07,546
change pricing, invite new
people to these different roles


647
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:09,976
that we have, as well as
submit apps for review,


648
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:14,246
both beta and for App Store.


649
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:17,106
The Developer role will be able
to do developer kinds of things,


650
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:19,686
upload the binaries,
view the crash logs,


651
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:23,266
and view the store
metadata in iTunes Connect.


652
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:29,106
Marketing role will be
able to actually change


653
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,686
that stored metadata in iTunes
Connect, upload promo art,


654
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:40,316
as well as request promo codes
for the apps on your team.


655
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:42,686
All three of these
roles will be eligible


656
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:47,206
for internal TestFlight
users, as well as have access


657
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:50,086
to create in-app purchases,
leaderboards, achievements,


658
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,116
and view Resolution Center.


659
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,396
And these are the changes
that we are rolling


660
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:58,016
out for users and roles.


661
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:02,746
[ Applause ]


662
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:04,436
So what's new in iTunes Connect?


663
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:08,676
We have a new version release
control, a new pricing design,


664
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:13,196
separate TestFlight versions
for internal and external users,


665
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:17,735
increased TestFlight limits,
new encryption plist keys,


666
00:34:18,146 --> 00:34:23,076
account switching, app siloing,
and new users and roles.


667
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:28,496
And all these features will
be coming out later this fall.


668
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:32,306
Now, each year we like to ask
App Review if they had a chance


669
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:35,356
to help explain to some
developers, such as yourselves,


670
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,525
what could I impart on you
to help your apps make it


671
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:40,275
through App Review better?


672
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:41,916
And they give us a list.


673
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,446
This year they have
gone one step better


674
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:46,216
and they have a web page
you can look up and see:


675
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:47,545
What are the common rejections?


676
00:34:47,846 --> 00:34:49,106
What problems are
people are having?


677
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:51,446
Such as your demo account info.


678
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:55,585
If your app requires a login to
function, you need to provide


679
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,966
that in iTunes Connect
beforehand.


680
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:00,706
Or if you have an in-app
purchase that requires services


681
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:04,286
to be running before the in-app
purchase works, have that ready


682
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:06,946
at app submission time, not
just when you want your app


683
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:07,796
to go live in the Store.


684
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:10,696
This is a really great web page,


685
00:35:10,696 --> 00:35:11,976
and I highly recommend
checking it out.


686
00:35:13,576 --> 00:35:15,416
We also have another web page


687
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:18,676
about what makes good
information about my app.


688
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:20,156
What makes a good name?


689
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:21,586
What is a good description?


690
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:26,236
This is another great resource
for understanding your metadata


691
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:27,246
and filling that out well.


692
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:30,026
And the third page
I want to talk


693
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,346
about is dedicated
just to app previews.


694
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:34,876
We launched this last
year, and it's a great way


695
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:36,996
to give your customers
a dynamic feel


696
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:40,506
for what your app is
before they download it.


697
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,426
You want to know what it
is and how to get started?


698
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:43,386
Check out this page.


699
00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:46,746
Now, for more information,
of course,


700
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:48,806
the iTunes Connect Guide
is a great resource.


701
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:51,586
The dev forums as well.


702
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,246
We have our Evangelist,
Mark Malone.


703
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:56,106
If you have any questions,
these are all great resources.


704
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,936
I want to call out
some related sessions.


705
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:01,156
We had one on Tuesday about iAd,


706
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:04,416
as well as one earlier this
morning all about app thinning.


707
00:36:05,636 --> 00:36:07,816
Later today, Getting the
Most Out of App Analytics


708
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,346
and iTunes Connect: Development


709
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:11,926
to Distribution will
be this afternoon.


710
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:14,296
And with that, I want
to wish you a great rest


711
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:14,986
of your conference.


712
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:15,996
Have a good day.


713
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:29,310
