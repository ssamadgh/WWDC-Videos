00:00:12,816 --> 00:00:13,976
>> Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,096
[ Applause ]


4
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:15,976
All right.


5
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,956
All right.


6
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:20,536
Let's have some fun today.


7
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:20,826
All right.


8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,106
Thank you for coming.


9
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:24,846
This is a session not
just creating app previews


10
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:27,336
but creating great app previews.


11
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:28,926
And I really believe that.


12
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:31,416
After this session, I believe
you're going to be able


13
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,636
to create a great app preview.


14
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,376
My name is Paul Turner and I'm


15
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:37,436
from the iTunes Engineering
Division.


16
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:41,496
And what that fancy title behind
you says, is that I have a job


17
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:43,236
that requires many talents.


18
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,356
It's true.


19
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,856
Not only do I run several teams
that keep content processing


20
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,286
such as your apps, processing
and flowing to the store.


21
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:56,646
But in my 10 years at Apple,
I've been lucky enough


22
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:59,836
to be able to participate
in producing and engineering


23
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:01,846
and launching incredible
projects.


24
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:05,346
One of my first projects was
with some of these people


25
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:05,976
in the front here,


26
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:08,966
it was actually the
original App Store launch.


27
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:13,766
Since then, we've done
iBooks Store and HD films


28
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:18,066
and iTunes Extras and LPs and
iTunes Match and The Beatles.


29
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:20,246
It's been awesome.


30
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:21,186
This isn't about me.


31
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:26,296
What's actually relevant to
you guys though is that one


32
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:29,066
of the teams that I run is
actually the logistics team


33
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,496
for apps made by Apple.


34
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:34,746
So, not only do I help engineer
and support iTunes Connect


35
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,656
but I am a customer of
it, just like you guys.


36
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:37,726
All right.


37
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:42,086
So, let's talk about you and
your apps and your app previews.


38
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:48,116
First, I want to talk about
how content is previewed


39
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,526
to customers on the store.


40
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:55,376
Currently, with our
amazing and innovative


41
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,846
and boundless music store,


42
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:59,276
we have those great
90-second previews.


43
00:01:59,276 --> 00:01:59,696
I love them.


44
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:01,926
I sit and click and
buy all day long.


45
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:05,376
And for my favorite
store, the film store,


46
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,196
we have those great
theatrical trailers.


47
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:09,606
And for the TV store, we
have episode previews.


48
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,626
And for everyone's
favorite, the iBooks Store,


49
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:16,296
we have those enticing
downloadable samples.


50
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,066
So, what do we have
for the App Store?


51
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:22,756
This week, we're
introducing app previews.


52
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:24,376
So, let's get to know them.


53
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:24,906
Yeah, whoo!


54
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:25,886
You're allowed to clap.

[ Applause ]


56
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:27,746
This is great.


57
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:28,406
This is good.


58
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:29,806
This is amazing.


59
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:30,726
All right.


60
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:32,066
Let's get to know app previews.


61
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:32,756
This is fun.


62
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:34,606
Let's pick it up where
Tim left us on Monday.


63
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:37,116
With that app that he
showed, Monument Valley.


64
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:41,206
And let's take a look at the way
that it's previewed to customers


65
00:02:41,206 --> 00:02:45,676
on the store right now.


66
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:46,546
It's pretty.


67
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:47,666
All right.


68
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,106
So, on the store, on the store's
product page, you're going


69
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:50,956
to have description text.


70
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:52,316
You're going to have other
information but, you know,


71
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:53,686
a picture is worth
a thousand words.


72
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,436
Let's look at these screenshots
and they're beautiful.


73
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:57,226
They're beautiful.


74
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,076
They're gorgeous.


75
00:02:58,476 --> 00:02:59,686
It's an amazing app.


76
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,746
But I'm curious as a customer,
I don't fully understand it.


77
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:05,596
I don't understand
how the app functions.


78
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:07,636
This is app previews.


79
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:11,506
So, if a picture is
worth a thousand words,


80
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:12,546
what's a video worth?


81
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,976
And this is it.


82
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:45,546
[ Music ]


83
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:49,626
Right before our eyes, Monument
Valley becomes this immersive


84
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:50,926
puzzle game.


85
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:53,216
And you make an immediate
emotional connection.


86
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,066
And that's app previews.


87
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:58,416
So, I want to start off,
get us all on the same page


88
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,856
with just some basic
information.


89
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,976
App previews are up to
30 seconds in length.


90
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:10,556
App previews are not really
brand or campaign-focused.


91
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,266
They are not full of cut scenes.


92
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,126
They're definitely not
theatrical trailers.


93
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,076
They're just brief videos
meant to demonstrate the UI,


94
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:21,086
the features or the
functionality of your app.


95
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:25,806
App previews are made
primarily of captured footage.


96
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:29,476
And we're going to show you how
to do that live on stage today.


97
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:33,586
And once you're finished
producing your app preview,


98
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,816
you're going to export out
a high-resolution source


99
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,266
that you're going
to upload right


100
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,936
into iTunes Connect very easy.


101
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,336
It's going to be reviewed
along with your binary.


102
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,906
We're going to re-encode
it for streaming


103
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,126
out to devices all
around the world.


104
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:47,636
It's incredible.


105
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,916
So, with that, let's talk
about the agenda today.


106
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,346
First off, we're going to
go over a little bit more


107
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:56,356
of the details in app
previews, the characteristics,


108
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:57,346
what makes them different


109
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,816
than anything you've
really seen before.


110
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,456
We're going to help you
take that first step.


111
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:02,936
And that's kind of the
most important step is,


112
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:06,506
the planning step, how to
plan your video creatively


113
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:07,536
and technically.


114
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:11,576
We're going to show you
that capture feature


115
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:13,396
and it's amazing and I love it.


116
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,596
We're also going to do
a little bit of editing.


117
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,116
We're going to show your
editing options with iMovie.


118
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,966
Next, we're going to show
you some composition tips.


119
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:25,046
We're going to demonstrate
the uploading right


120
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:26,016
into iTunes Connect.


121
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,676
And we'll round out everything
at the end with some guidelines.


122
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:30,956
Does that sound good
to everybody?


123
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:34,786
Yes, OK. It's OK to talk.


124
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:36,946
It's interactive.


125
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:37,946
All right.


126
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,196
Let's talk about those details.


127
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:42,936
All right.


128
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:43,706
App previews.


129
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,146
App previews are a feature
of the iOS App Stores.


130
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:49,426
And as you saw on the
Monument Valley that Tim showed


131
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:52,366
and we just showed here, app
previews are going to show


132
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,706
up in the first slot
of the new section


133
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,546
for screenshots and videos.


134
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,806
So, that first slot will be
dedicated to app previews


135
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:01,076
and show up on the product page.


136
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:07,006
App previews are
device specific,


137
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,596
meaning that if you
have a universal app,


138
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,606
you will upload a distinct
iPhone and a distinct iPad video


139
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:18,006
for your app previews.


140
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,576
Also, we're making it very easy.


141
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:22,766
You're going to upload just
that single set of videos


142
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,856
to your apps primary
localization and we're going


143
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:28,436
to disperse them to
the other storefronts


144
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:29,926
that your app is for sale on.


145
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:37,236
A couple more details, we need
those beautiful widescreens


146
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,756
to show off your app preview.


147
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:41,526
So, app previews are going
to be a feature of iOS 8


148
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,946
and they're going to
display on those iPhone,


149
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,106
those widescreen iPhones, the
iPod touches, the iPhone 5,


150
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,636
the iPod touches, the iPads
and the Desktop Store.


151
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:54,486
One question I get a lot,
they're not required,


152
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,596
but they're strongly encouraged.


153
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:58,086
And I'm glad you guys
are all here today.


154
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:58,936
You've taken the first step.


155
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,776
We didn't want to
launch app previews


156
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,856
until we made everything
available


157
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,536
and accessible to
every developer.


158
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,706
And now that we're doing that,


159
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,096
we're strongly encouraging
everyone to get on board.


160
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,226
We really want you
to get on board.


161
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:11,366
We're here for the session.


162
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:12,266
We're going to be in the lab.


163
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:14,296
We're here to help you get
on board with app previews.


164
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:15,186
We just think they're amazing.


165
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,846
This is my favorite.


166
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:19,486
This is my favorite
of all, my favorite.


167
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,466
We have native aspect
ratio support built in.


168
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:30,866
No longer will you have
to stretch or pinch or add


169
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:35,216
that to your videos to fit
in a widescreen player.


170
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,616
I want that off the screen as
bad, it's just burning my eyes.


171
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,376
We have native aspect
ratio support right in,


172
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:40,976
built right in.


173
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:45,576
So, you get the full UI
video in the playback.


174
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:46,706
It's fantastic.


175
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:51,426
I want to talk about
planning next.


176
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:54,286
I'm sure you guys
are sitting here.


177
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,186
I'm giving you a little
bit of information.


178
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,686
Maybe the wheels are spinning.


179
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,686
Maybe you think about your app.


180
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,446
Maybe you're wondering
what you're going to do.


181
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,486
So, let's talk about planning.


182
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,486
Planning is the biggest part
about making your app preview.


183
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:04,596
The rest of it we
made really easy.


184
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:08,486
So, planning is where you're
going to have to start.


185
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:11,116
First, you're going
to have to figure


186
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,576
out the goal of your
app preview.


187
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:17,376
Are you going to highlight
a feature, many features,


188
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:20,426
maybe the utility of your app?


189
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,256
Maybe you have a
really innovative UI.


190
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,466
Start thinking about
what your goal


191
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,486
of your 30-second app
preview is going to be.


192
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,096
And a great way to think


193
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,116
about this is what
makes my app magical


194
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:34,196
or what makes my app magic?


195
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,926
And an easy way to kind of put
yourself in that question is,


196
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:42,096
if somebody walked up to
you with your app, you know,


197
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:43,496
"Hey, I've got this app."


198
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,436
It's your app.


199
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,326
What would you want them to
say to you about the app?


200
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,266
You know, "Oh, I've
got this app.


201
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:50,996
It does this for phone basics."


202
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,926
Or, "Oh, I've got
this really cool app.


203
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:55,696
It revolutionizes
the way I...that"


204
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,156
or "What's your plan
over there?"


205
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,176
"Oh, this new cool
new game, it does this


206
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:00,316
and this character does that."


207
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,076
What makes your app magical?


208
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:04,636
You know, that's going to
make your magical app preview


209
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:05,996
and your app preview magical.


210
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:09,726
That's going to get people
to purchase your app.


211
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,516
Just like Monument Valley, you
saw those beautiful screenshots


212
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,346
and screenshots are
a very powerful tool.


213
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:17,436
But now, you have
this story to tell.


214
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:21,036
You have this...you have app
previews to fill in that story.


215
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,106
So, you're going to look
beyond your screenshots.


216
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,646
How do you tell your story
now with these videos?


217
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:28,476
It's fantastic.


218
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,976
A couple more things
on content planning.


219
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:36,016
So now, you started to figure
out what makes your app magical.


220
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:40,346
You're starting to
understand what your goal is.


221
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,426
Now, it's time to start
listing out these elements,


222
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,026
maybe list out the
elements that you want


223
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:46,246
to put in your app preview.


224
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:49,456
If you're an app that's already
on the store, a great place


225
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,086
to start would probably
be a description text,


226
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,836
that's probably your
first list today.


227
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:55,346
I bet every one of
you got bulleted list


228
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,476
in your description text right
now, you can just steal that,


229
00:09:58,216 --> 00:09:59,106
put that in your list.


230
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:00,976
But add to it, start
playing with things.


231
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:04,376
Start thinking about what
your app is all about.


232
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:07,086
Or, "Oh man, I spent so much
time on this great level.


233
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:08,546
I really want to show this off.


234
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:09,396
Kids love this."


235
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,666
Or, "I get so much feedback
about this portion of my app,


236
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,526
that's a great thing to
put in my app preview."


237
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:17,746
And I-- having said that,
now I highly encourage you


238
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,736
to make some kind of
outline or storyboard.


239
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:21,896
And you see the storyboard
that we have


240
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:22,936
up on here-- on the screen.


241
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,426
This is for storyboard
but we're going


242
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:25,786
to actually show the app
preview this is based


243
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:27,556
on in a little bit.


244
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,006
But, it doesn't have
to be fancy.


245
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:29,916
You don't have to
be a greater drawer.


246
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,336
This is a fantastic drawing.


247
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,776
[Speaker laughs] It
could be on a napkin,


248
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,626
it could be on a
Chipotle napkin.


249
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,336
You know, it doesn't matter
what you're drawing it on.


250
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,256
It could be a series
of arrows and boxes


251
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,776
but start storyboarding it out.


252
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,676
What do I want to
show in my video?


253
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,746
How am I going to put the
story together, right?


254
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,406
And along those lines,
you probably want to work


255
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,046
with that list of
elements, your storyboard


256
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,646
and start working
with the timing.


257
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,276
Remember you have a
finite amount of time.


258
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,526
So say, "I like this element,


259
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:58,856
I really want to
show off this UI."


260
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,566
That takes about
5 seconds to load.


261
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,666
Let's start working
with the timing here.


262
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:04,506
This is the time in
the planning stage.


263
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,506
You don't want to get bogged
down in the production stage.


264
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,786
You don't want to be
working on your app preview


265
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,356
and still not know what you're
trying to accomplish by it.


266
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,656
So, part of the planning stage,


267
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,896
and these are all basic
things I'm telling here,


268
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,206
but I think it's good to
remind everyone, it'll get you


269
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,586
out of the weeds if you're
on the production process.


270
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:25,336
And one last thing on content
planning, just like screenshots,


271
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,136
you have to disclose all
your In-App Purchases.


272
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,676
So, that's a good time in
your planning stage to figure


273
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:31,686
out how you're going to do that.


274
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:35,646
If you're going to show the,
you know, the sword of thunder


275
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:39,406
and that cost 10,000 coins,
you're either going to have


276
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,286
to figure out how to
disclose that with some kind


277
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,336
of textural element or
maybe you want to show how


278
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,856
that in-app purchase was
purchased in your app preview.


279
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:50,146
So remember, you have


280
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:53,356
to disclose all your in-app
purchases, plan for it.


281
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,176
It's a good tip.


282
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:55,666
All right.


283
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,986
A couple of technical
things to go over.


284
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:03,006
If you're a universal app, you
might have a great storyboard,


285
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,296
might have a great plan.


286
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:08,206
But your iPad app
and your iPad version


287
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,576
and your iPhone version may
have different UI elements


288
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,756
that you want to highlight or
need to highlight or capture


289
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:15,476
in a different way to edit
into your app preview.


290
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:17,896
And the planning phase
is good to identify those


291
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:20,286
so you can capture them when
you need them to edit them


292
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,436
into your production process.


293
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,886
Next one. Oh, this
is a good one.


294
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:30,496
You know your customers
best, and so therefore,


295
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,356
we're going to allow you
to pick your language


296
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:33,376
for your app preview.


297
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:36,276
And remember, it goes on to
your apps primary localization,


298
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,516
but you need to choose
a language.


299
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,806
Now, yet again, you know
your customers best.


300
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:43,196
If your app's primary
localization is Japanese


301
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,596
and it's primarily sold
in Japan, but yet you know


302
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,806
that your customer is
expecting an English video,


303
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:53,026
as long as it passes guidelines,
we're going to allow it.


304
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:55,006
So, in the planning
phase, it's good to figure


305
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,376
out what language
you're going to use.


306
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,886
This is probably the most
obvious thing I'm going


307
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:00,426
to tell you today.


308
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,806
The demo accounts, if you're
app opens up to a login screen,


309
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,226
it's going to be a
really boring app preview.


310
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,086
So, you're probably going


311
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,426
to need some demo
accounts, you know.


312
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:10,526
And along those lines,
you may need


313
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:14,296
to stage some information
into those accounts.


314
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,496
If you're a social app,
you're going to need


315
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,366
to put some social media.


316
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,626
And if you're a calendar
app, you're going to need


317
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,556
to put some calendar
information in.


318
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,986
If you're a game and you really
want to show off that 4th level


319
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:25,366
that you, you know, kids really
love, you're going to have


320
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,416
to figure out a way to
get to that 4th level.


321
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:31,216
And I caution you, don't stage
anything in your app preview


322
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,146
that cannot be accomplished
in your app.


323
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,656
Your app preview has to
be represented of the app


324
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,586
that customer will buy.


325
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:39,156
It's just a caution, I know
none of you guys would do that,


326
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,746
but I just want to
warn you about that.


327
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:46,566
Also in staging, it's a good
idea, just like screenshots,


328
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,426
we can't have any advertisements
in the app preview,


329
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,466
so it's a good time
to stage those out.


330
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:52,266
Sound good?


331
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:53,346
All right.


332
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:54,876
Let's show you a
cool app preview now,


333
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:55,976
enough of me talking.


334
00:13:56,716 --> 00:14:01,646
This is a preview from
our friends at Toco Boca,


335
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:04,676
for an app called Toca Labs.


336
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,046
And they just have put a
few captured clips together.


337
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:12,586
They demonstrate their quirky
art direction, their fun UI.


338
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:15,486
This is an app that gets
kids really involved


339
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:16,886
in experimentation in science.


340
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,636
It just gives you a
great picture of the app


341
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:19,796
in a brief amount of time.


342
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,446
Love to show it to
you right now.

Cool, right?


345
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:51,596
It's really neat.


346
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:51,986
I like it.

[ Applause ]


349
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:57,366
That's a great app preview.


350
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,266
Just a series of
clips, it's very basic.


351
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,026
My kid is addicted to this app.


352
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,336
She loves them, she loves them.


353
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:02,596
All right.


354
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:07,256
Now, I want to move
on to my favorite part


355
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,246
about this, the capture.


356
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:11,256
And you need a really
expensive cable for this


357
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,186
and really lots of...no,
I'm kidding,


358
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:14,506
you just need a Lightning cable.


359
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,926
It's...we've made it
so easy, it's amazing.


360
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:17,396
All right.


361
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,086
A couple things about capture.


362
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:25,136
In OS X Yosemite and iOS 8,
you're going to be able to hook


363
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:28,166
up your device via a Lightning
cable, right to your Mac,


364
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:31,786
open up QuickTime Player and
your device's screen output


365
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:35,096
and audio are available
as inputs just


366
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:36,006
like a camera would be.


367
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:36,976

369
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:38,636

[ Applause ]


371
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:42,556
Super easy.


372
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:44,686
I love it, I love it.


373
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:45,556
It's fantastic.


374
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:47,166
All right.


375
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:52,146
So, to do this obviously,
you're going to need iOS devices


376
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:53,226
that require Lightning cables.


377
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:56,286
So, that's your iPod
touches, your iPhone 5 series,


378
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,576
your iPads, you needed the
Lightning cable support,


379
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:00,806
it only works over Lightning.


380
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:06,096
But, in true Apple
form, it just works.


381
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:10,176
No special modes, no clicking,
no shaking it over your head.


382
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:12,176
Stamp on it three
times and it works.


383
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,686
It's plugin, select
it in QuickTime,


384
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,906
we're going to show it to you
today, it's really amazing.


385
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:18,326
It just woks, I love that.


386
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,226
A couple tips for capture.


387
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:26,216
We want to display the
highest quality video and audio


388
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:29,656
to the customers and so
we've made this capture tool


389
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,906
so that you can capture
the highest quality video


390
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:32,906
and audio of your app.


391
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:36,486
You spend a lot of time
making...perfecting every pixel


392
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:39,176
in your UI and we want to
capture every single pixel


393
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,616
and make sure that the
customer sees how much love and,


394
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,196
you know, everything that
you put into your app.


395
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,466
So, we're hoping that you're
going to use these Apple tools.


396
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,716
A tip just like Toca
Boca did there,


397
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:54,176
you can start your capture
or, you know, you can edit


398
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,416
in from your splash screen.


399
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,186
It looks really kind
of cool if you want to.


400
00:16:57,636 --> 00:16:58,916
But please don't
capture straight


401
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,516
from the home screen
going into your app


402
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:05,165
or if your app has inter-app
operability, don't switch back


403
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,796
and forth between apps.


404
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:10,876
This is about your single app
and its functions, let it shine,


405
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:12,665
capture only your app.


406
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,506
Go slow. I know that 30
seconds is scary to some of you


407
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,415
but really, you can make
some amazing app previews.


408
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,836
We're going to show
you a really awesome--


409
00:17:21,836 --> 00:17:23,406
a couple awesome
30-second app previews


410
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:24,705
in a second, but go slow.


411
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:27,306
If your customer can't follow
along with what you're doing,


412
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:29,326
they're not going to
understand your app preview,


413
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:30,336
they're not going to
understand your app,


414
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:32,776
and they're probably going to be
discouraged by it, so go slow.


415
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:38,796
Use intentional moves, smooth
moves, smooth moves, you know?


416
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:41,776
And there's no film or anything
to load into this camera.


417
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:45,256
The only limitation is your hard
drive so rehearse it, retake it.


418
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,576
You know, if you flub it and
you try and continue on, don't--


419
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:51,766
don't-- no, no, just stop,
retake, rehearse it, retake it.


420
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,206
You got plenty of time.


421
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,536
Make it look right.

00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:57,846
This is a face that's now
going on your app, you know,


423
00:17:57,846 --> 00:17:59,916
for 30 seconds for
your customers to see.


424
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:03,326
So, rehearse, retake, have--
you know, take some time.


425
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,526
And along those lines, I want


426
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,496
to show you a really
cool app preview.

This app preview is from
our friends at UpTo.


428
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:14,516
UpTo is a calendaring app that
deals with the different levels

of events in your life.

is an example of what we


431
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:19,886
like to call a one take.


432
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:22,406
Instead of editing
clips together,


433
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:27,136
they've literally taken a one
take shot at their app preview.


434
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:29,346
Click Record, they've
added a couple graphics


435

in the front and the back.


436
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:32,276

and they go


437
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:34,396
through this nice smooth
intentional movements.


438
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,456
They've populated it with
a lot of, you know, data.


439
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:39,646
They've staged their
app really well.


440
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:42,696
And in their one take video,
you get a great picture


441

into our composition section.


451
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:37,036
A couple tips on composition.


452
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,806
You have been developing your
app for days, weeks, months,


453
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,746
years, you know a
lot about your app.


454
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:45,786
Well, the customer
probably doesn't have


455
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,226
that same perspective.


456
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:49,586
So, when you're making
your app preview,


457
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:50,866
think about their perspective.


458
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:53,496
If you're going to barrage them
with a bunch of information


459
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,676
or assumptions about
what your app does,


460
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,676
they might be confused,
maybe put off.


461
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:59,466
So, think about your
customer's perspective.


462
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:02,156
And, you know, this is a
great, great tip is, you know,


463
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:04,976
use your friends, your family,
or everybody at your office.


464
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:07,636
Show your app preview
off and look


465
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:10,196
for what their feedback
is, you know.


466
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:11,896
See if there's something missing


467
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,046
to your story 'cause
you might have something


468
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:14,936
in your head that, you know,


469
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,276
somebody else doesn't
have in their head.


470
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,276
This is a common mistake; a
very, very common mistake.


471
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:22,476
If you're going to put
text up on the screen,


472
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:26,366
you need to put it up there long
enough for people to read it.


473
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,566
People do this all the time.


474
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,186
They throw a text up on the
screen and they don't make it--


475
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,976
you know, they've-- it's
gone before you can read it.


476
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:34,956
So, make sure if you're
throwing text up there,


477
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:37,086
allow people to read your text.


478
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,946
This one is easy for me
'cause I'm always positive.


479
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:41,996
Stay positive.


480
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:46,006
There's no worst sales pitch
than a negative sales pitch.


481
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:49,376
This is about your app and
why your app is the best


482
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,236
or why your app is awesome.


483
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,516
So, don't imply anything
about other applications.


484
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,736
Just keep it about your
app and stay positive.


485
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:59,566
This is real opportunity
for your app to shine.


486
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:03,126
A couple more tips.


487
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,026
You may be a cross-platform
developer,


488
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,726
but for these 30 seconds,
you're all App Store.


489
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,456
So, go ahead and leave
off those platform logos.


490
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:15,266
In fact, leave off
the App Store logo,


491
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,606
use the 30 seconds for you.


492
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,296
We like our logo
just and-- it's fine.


493
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,936
These are your 30 seconds.


494
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,036
Leave off the platform logos.


495
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:26,616
You might have this great idea.


496
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:33,286
"New for Spring" in your app
preview, and then, you know,


497
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:35,006
you think you're going
to upload a new binary


498
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:39,416
or upload a new preview and your
cat gets sick or your car breaks


499
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,766
down and it's eight months later


500
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,306
and it's winter or
whatever season.


501
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:46,306
And now, it says,
"New for Spring,"


502
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,586
and it makes absolutely
no sense.


503
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:50,816
So, keep it timeless.


504
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:53,236
Allow your app preview just to
be about your app in some kind


505
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:55,126
of neutral time space.


506
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:57,966
Straightforward transitions.


507
00:21:58,206 --> 00:22:03,066
Now I love a star wipe
or barn doors or confetti


508
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:04,676
as much as the next guy.


509
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,346
Remember this is about your app,


510
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:09,396
so straightforward transitions
are really recommended


511
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,636
when you're making
an app preview.


512
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,556
Straightforward transitions
we actually have found just


513
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:16,826
in our tests can actually
sometimes be confusing though.


514
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,466
Jump cuts is what we
recommend for everyone.


515
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:21,936
You've seen a lot of jump cuts
here and I'll show you a couple


516
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:23,816
of app previews that have
a lot of great jump cuts.


517
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:27,106
But in a couple situations, we
noticed that in jump cutting,


518
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:29,596
you can imply that
your app does something


519
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:31,126
that your app doesn't
actually do.


520
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:33,306
So, another great
straightforward transition is


521
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:35,556
like a dissolve or
a fade-through color


522
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:40,686
to give your user-- oh, OK,
this is a fade to another clip.


523
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,236
Make sure you don't imply


524
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,126
that your app does
something that it does not.


525
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,496
You don't want to
confuse your customers,


526
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,426
we love our customers.


527
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:49,846
My last point is,
remember the tone.


528
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:53,176
These aren't in your
face marketing videos.


529
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:58,516
This is just simple short app
usage videos, they're fantastic.


530
00:22:58,516 --> 00:22:59,386
Remember the tone.


531
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:01,026
All right.


532
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,616
This is my things
to avoid slide,


533
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,696
I'll put my deep serious
voice on for this.


534
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:06,796
All right.


535
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:07,376
Things to avoid.


536
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:08,696
It's not that serious,
don't worry.


537
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:14,726
Blinking, crazy, flashing,
loud, obnoxious things,


538
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,236
this isn't the '90s and
these aren't banner ads.


539
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:21,316
If they're watching
your app preview,


540
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,916
they're already on
your product page.


541
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,096
They've already clicked Play,


542
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:26,176
you don't need a
gimmick to draw them in.


543
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:27,996
Please keep it simple.


544
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:29,516
You don't have to do this.


545
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:34,136
Pricing, if you're going to
put pricing in your video,


546
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:34,906
it's going to get lost,


547
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:37,516
it's going to put
you into the corner.


548
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:39,766
Remember, your app preview


549
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,446
or your app is sold
internationally.


550
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,566
You may put your
app on sale one day.


551
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:45,576
If you block yourself in
the pricing in your video,


552
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:46,866
it's not going to
make any sense.


553
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:47,816
Leave the pricing out.


554
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,586
These are going to display
in your product page.


555
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,296
The product page
already has pricing.


556
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:53,306
It already has storefront-based
pricing.


557
00:23:53,826 --> 00:23:59,846
Leave the pricing
for the product page.


558
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:04,176
Local-- yeah, you know,
local colloquialisms, memes,


559
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,986
things like that,
references to Game of Thrones


560
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:08,916
that I don't even understand
because I don't watch the show.


561
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,586
I'm probably the
only one who doesn't.


562
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,316
But this is about
your app preview.


563
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:17,456
It's not about anything that's
going on in the media nowadays.


564
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,526
So, just keep it about
your app, keep it simple.


565
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:21,486
And here's the big one.


566
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:24,496
You can't put anything-- this
is just like screenshots,


567
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,666
it's just like your app,
you can't put anything


568
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,976
in your app preview that you
don't have the rights to use.


569
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,406
And this includes, but
isn't limited to, imagery


570
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:36,466
or photography or text or
sounds or music or videos.


571
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:40,686
If you don't have the rights
to use it, do not put it


572
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,446
in your app preview, all right.


573
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:45,186
That was as serious
as it's going to get.


574
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:47,256
One thing we added in
here 'cause we got a lot


575
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:49,096
of questions on it,
is narration.


576
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:53,596
Absolutely, it's a powerful
tool if used correctly.


577
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,776
So, here's a couple of tips.


578
00:24:56,736 --> 00:25:00,476
There is an incredible
voiceover community out there.


579
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,926
Look for them, they're
so talented.


580
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:04,556
Use professional voices.


581
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:08,806
Not everyone has the intonation
and clarity for voice over work.


582
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,026
Obviously, I don't either, um.


583
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,006
But remember, this
is a voice now.


584
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:16,296
This is the voice of your app.


585
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:17,596
So, choose your voice wisely.


586
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,006
The second one is use
professional equipment.


587
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:22,876
It's available everywhere.


588
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:26,296
Condenser mics, pop filters,
just recording studios


589
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,606
in general, quiet rooms.


590
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:31,326
Nobody wants to listen to an app
preview with a narration on it


591
00:25:31,326 --> 00:25:33,276
and they can hear your dog
barking at the background.


592
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,986
Or maybe for some of our younger
developers, you know, "Jenny,


593
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:39,756
come down to dinner," you know.


594
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:47,556
No, no. And lastly,
narration is a powerful tool,


595
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:49,076
but sometimes, it
can be overused.


596
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:51,396
You don't want to narrate your
entire video, but you want


597
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,466
to let your app speak.


598
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:55,646
So, just use narration wisely
is what I'm going to say.


599
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:57,906
And having said that, I want


600
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,236
to show you a really
cool app preview.


601
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:03,406
It's for a game called
Leos Fortune which I think,


602
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:05,556
they got a design
award this week?


603
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:07,836
Got a design award--
hey, good for them.


604
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:08,876
Really cool.

[ Applause ]


606
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:13,536
So, they have done
something really neat


607
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:14,396
with their narration.


608
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:16,956
They have their character
narrate


609
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:18,406
in the intro to their games.


610
00:26:18,406 --> 00:26:20,196
So, they integrated
that narration


611
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:22,276
with some capture
gameplay footage.


612
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:26,326
So, you kind of get a picture
of the story of the game as well


613
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:27,926
as the gameplay all in one.


614
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,216
Leo's Fortune preview, I'd
love to show it to you.


615
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:33,586
>> [Background Music] I used
to be Leopold the Golden,


616
00:26:34,016 --> 00:26:36,426
but when my fortune
was stolen from me,


617
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:39,656
I was only Leopold the Fool.


618
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:43,076
Around me, the world
was crumbling.

The lands decayed.


620
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,136
Order was lost.


621
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:51,806
I am on a journey
with one purpose only,


622
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:56,446
to find my fortune
and get it back.


623
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:00,686
>> Cool, right?


624
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:00,946
I love that.

626
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:07,186
That was an app preview that
I saw and I immediately went


627
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:10,046
and bought the game and, you
know, now I'm on like level 12


628

or something like that.


629
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:14,696
OK. So, to give you
a lot of information,


630
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:17,106
but really there's no better
way to get to know all this


631
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:18,156
than to demonstrate it.


632
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,626
So, what I'd like to
demonstrate first is capture.


633
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:23,866

to bring up Mr. John Danty,

And now, we're going to
switch over that audio, too,


674

because we want to get the
great audio out of GarageBand.

We're going to grab those clips
that we just did with John.

00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:33,116

them in to our event.

clips, we can favorite them,

we can work with them.


862
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,156
And then we have our
timeline down here


863
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:43,326
where we can start
building our preview,


864

865
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,166
So, let's just start
with some drums.


866
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,686
These are drums we captured off
stage, a little hard to capture


867
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:50,526
in this room with the echo.


868
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,766
So, I'm going to
drag those in here,


869
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:57,666
make this timeline a little
smaller so I can work with it.


870
00:35:57,666 --> 00:36:00,056
What was that next instrument?


871
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:00,726
That was the bass.


872
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:04,156
So, I'm just scrubbing
along here.


873
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:05,996
You can see I have the
waveform view up right here.


874
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:10,516

where my audio clicks in.

I got...there we go,
that's a good amount.

It's the bass right there.

And what was next?


878
00:36:22,796 --> 00:36:25,696
That was the synth, right,
with the cool controllers.


879
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,556
Let's get that.


880
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:34,426

bit of that.

00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:41,216

slick my way from up.

There we go.


885
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:49,986
We get right as those come
in, can I get that hit?


886
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:54,246
How about four seconds for that.


887
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,596
That looks good.


888
00:36:57,826 --> 00:37:01,236
OK. We exported out
John's song earlier,


889
00:37:01,356 --> 00:37:02,316
I put that in the folder too.


890
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:04,816
So, we're going to
drag that down


891
00:37:04,816 --> 00:37:07,806
into the soundtrack
section just right there.


892
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:11,886
Now, I could add maybe
some titles to this

894
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:16,546

end on a fade to black

in any video that I do.


896

that on there,

make that look really pro.


898
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:27,686
What I want to do also is
I want to mute these clips


899
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,786
so they don't conflict with
that soundtrack, all right?

give this a whirl.

what we could do

for this is we could add
a couple more instruments,

we did the other afternoon.

00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:40,106
highest quality video
to your customers.


1028
00:44:40,536 --> 00:44:43,036
A couple takeaways is
the 30 frames per second.


1029
00:44:43,036 --> 00:44:45,886
We'd like you to upload your
sources in 30 frames per second.


1030
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:50,736
And we're going to take stereo
audio either in AAC or PCM wave.


1031
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:54,426
Basic, all this documentation
will be available to you,


1032
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:55,506
don't worry about
writing it down,


1033
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:56,946
I see this guy writing
it down, I'm sorry.


1034
00:44:57,506 --> 00:45:00,596
It's OK. All right.


1035
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:04,636
I'd like to end out with a
couple review guidelines.


1036
00:45:05,296 --> 00:45:08,896
Now, the review guidelines
will be published


1037
00:45:08,896 --> 00:45:10,886
as this feature is rolled out.


1038
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:14,116
And obviously, I'm not going to
be able to go over every single,


1039
00:45:14,116 --> 00:45:16,226
applicable review
guideline to you.


1040
00:45:16,226 --> 00:45:18,696
But, I'd like to highlight
a few that'll help find you


1041
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:19,536
safe passage.


1042
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,626
Remember things like
inappropriate content,


1043
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:26,206
trademarked items, all
apply to app previews.


1044
00:45:26,616 --> 00:45:31,146
So, consult the app review
guidelines before uploading your


1045
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:31,666
app preview.


1046
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:34,076
First one, keep it relevant.


1047
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,176
If your app has screenshots,
or app previews


1048
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:39,646
that are absolutely not relevant


1049
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:41,746
to your app, it will
be rejected.


1050
00:45:42,136 --> 00:45:45,646
So, don't sneak in a plug for
your Uncle Murray's car wash


1051
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:49,886
or a, you know, surprise
proposal to your fiancee.


1052
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:51,256
This is not the time.


1053
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:52,676
Keep it relevant to your app.


1054
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:54,626
By the way, she said yes
and we're married, I know.


1055
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:57,906
Yay, all right.


1056
00:45:58,716 --> 00:46:02,536
Next one, just like screenshots,
you got to keep it 4+.


1057
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:04,916
And I know you're sitting
there maybe have a game called


1058
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,206
Mortal Kombat.


1059
00:46:06,716 --> 00:46:08,076
And that you're like,
"Paul, do I have to make it


1060
00:46:08,076 --> 00:46:09,716
into a tickle fest or
something like that?"


1061
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:12,036
No. But you're going to have
to get creative, you know,


1062
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,106
what did Spielberg do when
the shark didn't work?


1063
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,356
He made "Jaws" and
it was awesome.


1064
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:18,666
So, get creative, creative
editing, just, you know,


1065
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:20,276
leave the violence,
those things out.


1066
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:22,836
It has to be 4+ applicable
to all audiences just


1067
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:25,426
like screenshots, easy enough.


1068
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:26,786
All right.


1069
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:28,566
Use captured footage.


1070
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:34,336
No people in-- you know,
videos of people interacting


1071
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,696
with your apps, no
hands in the shots,


1072
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:38,556
so let's remove that hand.


1073
00:46:38,816 --> 00:46:39,886
This is captured footage.


1074
00:46:39,886 --> 00:46:41,686
You can use some
textual elements.


1075
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:44,916
You can use graphic elements
that highlight points.


1076
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:47,716
But, this is mostly about your
app and your app preview needs


1077
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:49,886
to be made mostly
of captured footage.


1078
00:46:49,886 --> 00:46:51,206
And we've given you those tools.


1079
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:52,886
So, use captured footage.


1080
00:46:54,256 --> 00:46:57,856
This one, simulated data please,
this goes without saying.


1081
00:46:58,136 --> 00:47:00,596
Please don't use any
celebrities, don't use anybody,


1082
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:02,736
don't use your neighbor, your
friend, the person sitting next


1083
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,416
to you, anybody that
would have issue with use


1084
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,906
of their likeness
in your app preview.


1085
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:09,876
You know about Johnny Appleseed,
we use it all the time.


1086
00:47:10,196 --> 00:47:12,956
You need to find your own Johnny
Appleseeds and if you're going


1087
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:14,846
to use any data in
your app preview.


1088
00:47:15,786 --> 00:47:18,496
This last one, I've gone over it
before, I'll go over it again.


1089
00:47:18,726 --> 00:47:21,726
You got to identify your
in-app purchases, you know,


1090
00:47:21,726 --> 00:47:26,326
the sword of truth, the missiles
in our Touch Fighter app here.


1091
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,796
You got to figure out a
way in your app preview--


1092
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:31,116
if you're going to use those
in-app purchase content,


1093
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:32,806
you got to figure out
a way to disclose them


1094
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:35,136
in your in-app purchases,
simple as that.


1095
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,966
Just a couple guidelines to
keep in your head, very easy.


1096
00:47:38,016 --> 00:47:40,056
We want to make this
very easy for you guys.


1097
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:41,116
All right.


1098
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:43,116
Time for a summary.


1099
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:48,726
App previews are just 30
seconds of app usage footage.


1100
00:47:48,726 --> 00:47:53,756
They need to be 4+ and
appropriate for all audiences.


1101
00:47:55,476 --> 00:48:01,016
Device capture using a Lightning
cable, Mac OS X Yosemite


1102
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:04,596
and iOS 8 into QuickTime player.


1103
00:48:04,596 --> 00:48:07,316
You're going to edit on
your Mac using iMovie.


1104
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:08,506
iMovie will be updated


1105
00:48:08,706 --> 00:48:11,906
to support those native aspect
ratios and device dimensions.


1106
00:48:11,906 --> 00:48:13,626
For more advanced editing,


1107
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:16,506
Final Cut Pro is
always a great option.


1108
00:48:16,506 --> 00:48:17,306
Love Final Cut Pro.


1109
00:48:18,746 --> 00:48:21,906
And we've made it super easy as
Karen showed you to upload them


1110

into iTunes Connect along
with your binary reviewed.


1111
00:48:25,126 --> 00:48:25,906

1112
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:29,146
that for streaming
all around the world.


1113
00:48:29,146 --> 00:48:32,926
Simple. I want to close out
with a really cool app preview.


1114
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:34,596
And this one's kind
of personal to me.


1115
00:48:34,596 --> 00:48:37,876
This one came in and I believe
this app also won a design award


1116
00:48:38,026 --> 00:48:39,076
this week which is kind of neat.


1117
00:48:39,736 --> 00:48:42,926
This app preview came in
and it just touched me.


1118
00:48:43,556 --> 00:48:45,936
Ever since I was a kid,
I was one of those people


1119
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:48,366
that would kind of sit
and look out of the stars.


1120
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:49,786
And everybody does this, right?


1121
00:48:49,786 --> 00:48:53,596
You've put your finger out, you
kind of trace the Big Dipper


1122
00:48:53,596 --> 00:48:56,946
or you track Orion or
something like that.


1123
00:48:57,296 --> 00:49:00,476
And this preview came in
and it showed me an app


1124
00:49:00,476 --> 00:49:03,136
that did what I always
dreamed I could I do.


1125
00:49:03,136 --> 00:49:05,306
I immediately-- yet again,
immediately run to my iPad,


1126
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:06,596
bought the app, went home,


1127
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:08,736
sat out on the porch
with my daughter.
