00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,111
[Applause]


2
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:25,546
>> PAUL TURNER: Thank you.


3
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:26,636
Thank you, everyone.


4
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:27,646
Thanks for joining us here.


5
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:29,906
Thank you for joining
us for session 304.


6
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:33,096
Welcome. My name is
Paul Turner and I'm one


7
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,706
of the engineering managers
for iTunes, but I also --


8
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:37,266
some of the teams that I lead,


9
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,946
one of the teams is
the best teams at Apple


10
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,226
and that's the team that
manages the logistics


11
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,106
and release control for
all of Apple's own apps.


12
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:46,466
And we use iTunes Connect,
just like you guys.


13
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:50,226
So this is a new session
we're trying out this year,


14
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:52,606
this is iTunes Connect
Development and Distribution.


15
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:55,756
We already have the
wildly popular what's new


16
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,456
on iTunes Connect.


17
00:00:57,276 --> 00:01:01,466
We just devoted an incredible
session to app analytics


18
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,516
and maybe some of the
fundamental features


19
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:05,966
of iTunes Connect to make
sure that you are empowered


20
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:07,356
to make best use out of them.


21
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:08,486
That's what this is.


22
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,526
From the conversations
that I had in the labs,


23
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:13,086
I think we picked
the right topics.


24
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:15,786
Let's jump into them.


25
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,386
We will talk about
the help and resources


26
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:19,376
that are available for you guys.


27
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,826
I want to talk about
the vast resources


28
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:24,646
that are available very
quickly but then we will jump


29
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:26,636
into a demo of TestFlight.


30
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:30,796
Then we will briefly go
over some of the materials


31
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:32,706
that you need to launch
your app on the App Store


32
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:38,366
which will lead us into a deep
dive of transporter and XML


33
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,856
and how you manage them.


34
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:42,476
Sound good?


35
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:44,456
Sounds good, all right!


36
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:47,666
It's an interactive
presentation.


37
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:48,396
Stay with me here.


38
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:48,716
All right.


39
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,226
Let's jump in.


40
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:52,416
This screen should be
available to everyone,


41
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,306
this is iTunes Connect,


42
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:56,646
and here's all the
beautiful modules on this.


43
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,176
This is my favorite module.


44
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,056
My favorite module.


45
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:02,206
This is My Apps.


46
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,176
This is where you spend a
lot of your time, the bread


47
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:05,776
and butter of iTunes Connect.


48
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,186
This is where you
manage your apps


49
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,416
and manage your TestFlight
campaigns, manage versions


50
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,646
and manage your pricing
and availability.


51
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,916
My Apps, if this was
a physical button,


52
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,386
I feel like mine would
have the paint worn off,


53
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:20,386
because I'm always in there.


54
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:21,606
This is our baby.


55
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:23,316
Our baby's name is
App Analytics.


56
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,616
It launched this year.


57
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:28,146
It's really empowering you guys.


58
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,656
It's giving you data, I think
that only we can provide


59
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:34,176
because of the integration, and
it's really giving you a picture


60
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:37,666
of how your app exists in your
customer's hands and we do


61
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,376
that all the while


62
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,196
by maintaining your
customer's privacy.


63
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:41,976
So we love App Analytics.


64
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,246
I hope you caught
the session earlier.


65
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,806
It's amazing and as you can see,


66
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,066
we took the beta
badge off of it.


67
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:51,116
One more module I would like to
talk about, this is my protip


68
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,546
of the day and it's
not that big of a tip.


69
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:55,336
I already had a couple of
questions about it in the labs.


70
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,386
And it's the agreements,
tax, and banking section


71
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,836
and so this section -- my protip
is make sure you are caring


72
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:04,046
and feeding for your
iTunes Connect by going


73
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,716
into the agreements,
tax, and banking section


74
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:07,686
and accepting your agreements.


75
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,436
I think one went live on
Monday, the unified agreement.


76
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,886
We had a couple of
questions in the lab.


77
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,926
My protip is make sure you keep
your account up to date and go


78
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,156
into your Agreements
and Tax and Banking.


79
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:18,606
It's a stellar tip.


80
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:22,276
Don't tell anyone.


81
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:25,286
This is Help and Resources,
resources and help.


82
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:26,966
This is all new.


83
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:27,976
We are revamping it.


84
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,296
We put as much design as the UI
designers let us put in there,


85
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,266
I don't know if you
caught the session earlier,


86
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,596
but we are putting it
outside the log-in screen.


87
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:39,226
It's fully searchable
and it will be great.


88
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:42,646
Help and resources.


89
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,976
Like I said,


90
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,966
it's outside the log-in and
it contains the best piece


91
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:52,896
of information you will ever own
and that is the developer guide.


92
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,586
This has everything
you need in it!


93
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,406
This tells you how to
launch apps and how


94
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:00,686
to get your assets ready and how
to interact with iTunes Connect.


95
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,186
Print it out, put it
under your pillow,


96
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:03,196
sleep with it, do
whatever you want.


97
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:07,036
The developer's guide is the
be-all and end-all document


98
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:09,196
and I hope you are reading
it and referencing it.


99
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,736
It has a lot more stuff.


100
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:12,776
It's 2015!


101
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:14,056
We have multimedia now.


102
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,216
We have some videos in there.


103
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,146
We have some deep dive videos.


104
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:21,116
A lot of you guys
have questions.


105
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,036
We read through the questions


106
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:24,506
and so we are making videos
constantly trying to to keep you


107
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:27,556
up to date, we have Agreements,
Tax, and Banking, TestFlight,


108
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:31,546
App Previews, App
Transfer, there as a video.


109
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:32,746
A lot of videos.


110
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:33,916
Check out these resources.


111
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:34,936
They are meant to help you.


112
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:36,856
Of course we have
the developer guide


113
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,546
but we have specialized
user guides,


114
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,096
one of which we will talk
about later in the session,


115
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,896
as the transporter user guides.


116
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:45,366
Deeper topics a lot of
specialized materials


117
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,476
and then last but definitely
not least, the FAQs.


118
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:51,206
We have this incredible
operations team that's


119
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:53,586
constantly going through
all the support requests,


120
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:56,766
all the developer posts,
anything, and everything,


121
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:59,496
trying to come up with
relevant FAQs for you guys.


122
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,336
It's likely that if
you have a question,


123
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,766
it's answerable in the FAQs.


124
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:04,836
So that's resources and help.


125
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:06,456
I'm just going to move on here.


126
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:09,806
New also this year we have
iTunes Connect specific


127
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:10,676
developer forums.


128
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:11,786
I hope you are using them.


129
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:14,296
We have an incredible community
of developers out there,


130
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,976
which is you guys and
thousands of others


131
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:20,346
and if you have a question,
there's probably a place --


132
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:23,046
somebody else probably
had the same question.


133
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:25,166
It's self-help, questions
and answers.


134
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:26,986
It's a forum post,
that's moderated


135
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,926
and it's a fantastic
resource for you guys.


136
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:31,506
We would love to hear
your feedback on it.


137
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,066
We think it's doing
really great.


138
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:37,186
It's questions and answers
and support and it's not


139
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,696
for proprietary information
there.


140
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:41,766
Don't pass any passwords to your
accounts and things in there.


141
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:43,926
I will put up the
URL right here.


142
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,606
Quickly moving on to another
support resource that's


143
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:50,456
available, yes, AppleCare,
our friends at AppleCare.


144
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:54,406
We have iTunes Connect technical
support, via AppleCare.


145
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:56,036
If you go into help and
resources right now,


146
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:58,366
it's up in the top left
corner, it's called contact us,


147
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,916
and you can reach it via
the developer forums.


148
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:06,986
Then we can filter it down by,
I think 19 different categories.


149
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:09,126
We can get your issue
to the right specialist.


150
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:12,216
Sometimes you have a problem
with your account and you want


151
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,176
to ask somebody a question.


152
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:15,166
Go for it.


153
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,386
Ask us. It's there for you.


154
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,836
I have a little bit
of a surprise,


155
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,576
although I think it's
already out this in the wild,


156
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,486
but we have an 800-number now.


157
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:23,746
You can call us.


158
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:26,376
If you have questions that you
really need to somebody about,


159
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:29,616
the account, you can call
us on an 8-hundred number.


160
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,846
It rings to phone in my pocket.


161
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:32,256
No, I'm kidding.


162
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,356
Oh, it -- somebody is actually
calling -- there you go.


163
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,616
I will put that number
up right now.


164
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:41,416
You guys can write it down
or take a picture of it.


165
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,876
That's the iTunes
Connect technical support.


166
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,256
Nobody hummed.


167
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:48,916
Too bad. 1-800-633-2152.


168
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:54,546
[Laughter]


169
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:55,976
I had a bet with people
that I wouldn't sing.


170
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,026
There you go.


171
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:01,236
All right.


172
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:03,006
I know you want to see
TestFlight and XML.


173
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,296
Here we go.


174
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,386
There's a couple
of other resources,


175
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:11,286
developer technical support.


176
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,306
Sometimes you read
the documentation,


177
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,516
and you have asked the
questions in the dev forums


178
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:17,066
and maybe you have
interacted with AppleCare


179
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,076
but maybe it's more of a
deeper engineering question.


180
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:21,676
Developer technical support
is always available to you.


181
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:25,126
Go and check it out and
also I really encourage you


182
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:26,706
to join our bug filing
community.


183
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,296
We really appreciate the
bugs that you guys file.


184
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,716
We read them and
prioritize them and fix them.


185
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,996
It's a great relationship
that we have with you


186
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:34,796
and I really appreciate it.


187
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:36,056
So join the community.


188
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:41,086
Lastly, I just want to reinforce
that there's some great articles


189
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:44,546
on the developer -- excuse
me, the developer section.


190
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,186
Developer portal.


191
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,306
This one, we talked about in
the new and iTunes Connect,


192
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,426
but I will put it up here again.


193
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:54,396
The app review is giving you the
most common rejection reasons


194
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:55,636
for your app not making it


195
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:58,526
through the first pass
through app review.


196
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,676
They keep it up to date.


197
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:00,396
It's fantastic.


198
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,486
There are a couple of others.


199
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:06,636
There's a marketing video that's
available as well or excuse me,


200
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,446
a marketing article,
that's available as well.


201
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,776
It shows you how to make your
product page look its best.


202
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:11,606
Check it out.


203
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:12,696
These are great articles.


204
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,596
There's another one
on app previews.


205
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,086
All right.


206
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,776
So that's the help
and resources section.


207
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:20,266
I wanted to reinforce
those things and make sure


208
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,026
that you were empowered.


209
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:24,576
So, what do you do when you have
an app that's about ready to go?


210
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:25,436
You test it.


211
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:26,586
And what do you test it with?


212
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,576
You test it with TestFlight.


213
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:30,826
I would like to bring up my
good friend, Alex Miyamura


214
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,586
to give you a demo
of TestFlight.


215
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,885
[Applause]


216
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,716
>> ALEX MIYAMURA: Thank
you so much, Paul.


217
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:40,486
I'm Alex Miyamura.


218
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,166
I'm an engineer with the
TestFlight team I'm here


219
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,736
to show you how easy it is


220
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:47,036
to distribute your
app via TestFlight.


221
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:51,676
Now, we will begin with a
screen that is very familiar to,


222
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:54,536
I'm pretty sure everyone
in this room right now,


223
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:55,486
and this is Xcode.


224
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:58,886
I have an app that I
created open, Touch Fighter


225
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:02,086
and I'm going to upload
it up to iTunes Connect.


226
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:07,386
Now, in order to do that, I will
go up to product, and archive.


227
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,956
And one of the great things
about TestFlight is that instead


228
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:12,976
of having to upload
one beta build


229
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:15,676
and then also an App Store
build, if you find a beta build


230
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:19,306
that works for you and
you want to distribute


231
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:26,056
that to the App Store, you
don't have to do that again.


232
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:31,166
I can go ahead and click this
big button, submit to App Store.


233
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,536
Usually you would go
through the prompt


234
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,806
and would you deliver your
build to the App Store


235
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,356
but in the interest of time,
I'm actually going to switch


236
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:42,186
over to iTunes Connect, where I
have a build that's already been


237
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:48,636
-- a build that's already been
uploaded to iTunes Connect.


238
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,316
And here we go.


239
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,486
Thank you so much.


240
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,856
[Applause]


241
00:09:56,356 --> 00:09:58,836
>> ALEX MIYAMURA: And so now
you will see the My Apps module


242
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:01,376
that Paul spoke about,
and we'll click in there


243
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,866
and see TouchFighter
is right in there.


244
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,406
We will click in there.


245
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,556
And you will see
the prerelease tab.


246
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,496
Now, of course, we are
TestFlighting these apps.


247
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:12,406
So we do care about prerelease


248
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:14,256
and we will go straight
into there.


249
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:19,576
And you will see we have
build two of version 1.0


250
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:23,776
and we actually get a lot of
questions from developers as to


251
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,946
where that comes from, right?


252
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,136
And I will actually
show you right now.


253
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,516
So we will go back to Xcode.


254
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:36,136
And we are in the
info.plist file for my app.


255
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:40,156
I will zoom in so everyone
can see and as you can see,


256
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:43,276
the bundle version
short string is 1.0.


257
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,026
That matches 1.0 that we
saw in iTunes Connect.


258
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,656
And the bundle version is 2,


259
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,916
which matches the build
number build number 2.


260
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:55,706
And test flight has
two types of testing.


261
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,866
We have internal testing
and external testing.


262
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,866
And first, we'll go
over internal testing.


263
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:04,256
Internal testing is used
to distribute your app


264
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:06,686
to a small select
group of testers,


265
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,656
within your iTunes
Connect organization.


266
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:13,896
These testers must be either an
admin role or a technical role


267
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,676
and you get 25 of them.


268
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,586
Each build that you distribute
is currently available


269
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:22,306
for 30 days, but
coming this fall,


270
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:23,616
we're actually going
to double that.


271
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,726
It will be available
for 60 days.


272
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,116
[Applause]


273
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,736
And so we will go
ahead and click


274
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:33,496
into the internal testers tab.


275
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:36,386
And you will see that
I'm here, Alex Miyamura,


276
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,216
and I want to invite one


277
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:41,466
of my colleagues Johnny
Appleseed to be a tester.


278
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,316
Oh, here's Johnny Appleseed.


279
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:50,646
He's a technical user and so
we can invite him as a tester.


280
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:56,956
And we will go to
TestFlight beta testers


281
00:11:57,396 --> 00:12:00,576
and select his Apple
ID and hit save.


282
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:04,976
When we have done that, that
actually adds my colleague,


283
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,986
Johnny Appleseed as a
tester and if we go back


284
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,296
to the internal testers tab,


285
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:12,576
you can see that Johnny
Appleseed is now a tester


286
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:12,996
for this app.


287
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:20,636
Now for them to install
the app on their iOS device


288
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:24,196
on the TestFlight app, they
will check all the testers


289
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:25,036
that they want to invite.


290
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:27,866
Go to save.


291
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:32,916
And then go back to
builds and you will see


292
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,736
that we have a switch for
TestFlight beta testing.


293
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:39,406
We will go ahead and
toggle that switch


294
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:43,466
and that will send those invite
emails to all the testers


295
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,156
that you have selected.


296
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,526
As you can see, the build
is active for 30 days now.


297
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:57,476
And so once you -- once
you switched that switch,


298
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,166
you will see that I as a
tester have received an email


299
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:06,926
from the iTunes Store, and I'm
invited to test TouchFighter


300
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:14,606
and I can go ahead and open that
in TestFlight, and tap install.


301
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,776
Now we will see that
the app installs.


302
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:19,646
It's ready to open.


303
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:20,956
You go back to your home screen


304
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:23,366
and then you will see
TouchFighter right there next


305
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:26,176
to the TestFlight app
and that orange dot next


306
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,806
to TouchFighter indicates
it's a TestFlight app,


307
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:31,006
that it's a beta app.


308
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:34,746
And so once your testers
are able to test your app,


309
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,546
they will give you feedback


310
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,976
and you will be able
to iterate on that.


311
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:41,646
You will want to distribute your
app to a wider range of testers


312
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,946
and for that, we have
external testers.


313
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:49,236
And so we'll go into the
external testers' tab


314
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,496
and the first thing that
you will see is, wow!


315
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:57,046
You have 1,000 of these as
compared to 25 internal testers.


316
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,976
That's 40 times and
coming this fall,


317
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:01,136
again, we will double that.


318
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:03,256
Instead of 1,000,
you will be able


319
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,326
to have 2,000 external testers.


320
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:09,826
[Applause]


321
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:14,386
So in order to add testers to be
external testers for your build,


322
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:18,326
you will click on the plus,
and you will add new testers.


323
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,996
You can obviously
type in the email.


324
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,706
But this can get really tedious


325
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:31,476
if you have 1,000
names to type in there.


326
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:32,986
You will be there for
a long, long time.


327
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,816
So that's why we have added
this option to import a file.


328
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:41,206
Now, we provide you with the
CSV template if you click


329
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:45,016
on the question mark next
to import file, but in order


330
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,086
to actually import
those testers,


331
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,876
you will click open import file,


332
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:53,346
and it will actually
populate all the tester names


333
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:58,306
and you will be able
to add the testers.


334
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:03,076
The one difference, other than
the large amount of testers


335
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,016
that you get as external
testing,


336
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,826
versus internal testing is
that for external testing,


337
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:10,426
do you have to submit your
app for beta app review.


338
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,996
We will go ahead and do that.


339
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,556
You have to fill in
some information.


340
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,646
Obviously, you need to tell
your testers what to test.


341
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,276
They need to see what
features you really want


342
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:22,346
to have them focus on.


343
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:23,646
You might be adding
something new


344
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:28,706
and you really want them
to drill down in it.


345
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:31,866
Feedback email is very important
because the whole point


346
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,426
of testing is to be
able to get feedback


347
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,426
and to be able to
improve your app.


348
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:37,286
So we do require that.


349
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,756
Privacy policy is something
that you add as well


350
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:44,356
and then your app description.


351
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:51,086
"This is the best app ever."


352
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:54,136
And we also require some
contact information,


353
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:57,906
so that if there is a problem
with your app, we will be able


354
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:59,546
to reach out to you, and so


355
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:02,006
that that can be get
resolved as soon as possible.


356
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,006
And once you fill


357
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,416
that information in,
you can click next.


358
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,926
And export compliance.


359
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:15,056
We have some export
labs here at WWDC.


360
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,866
This is a fairly simple app


361
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:19,716
and so we will go
ahead and click no.


362
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:21,246
We will submit.


363
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:27,036
And now you will see
that external testing


364
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,776
for build 2 is waiting
for review.


365
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:30,386
Obviously you can
remove it from review


366
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,366
and once your app
passes beta app review,


367
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,386
iTunes Connect will
send you an email


368
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:40,456
and then you can send invites
to all of your external testers.


369
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,376
And now back to Paul.


370
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:47,366
[Applause]


371
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,316
>> PAUL TURNER: Alex
what was it,


372
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,586
the best feature is
the one you don't have?


373
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:52,653
>> ALEX MIYAMURA:


374
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:56,356
No provisioning profiles
and no UUIDs.


375
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:58,966
>> PAUL TURNER: I will
make T-shirts that say that


376
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:03,096
and we're going to wear them
around town and everyone's going


377
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,636
to think we are the
weirdest people ever.


378
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:11,205
Before I bring up Mr. Nik Uglov
to do a deep dive into XML,


379
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:14,566
I just want to remind everybody
of all the materials needed


380
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,796
to launch an app
on the App Store.


381
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:21,536
We come to the end and we are
about to release and we go, oh,


382
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:22,586
my gosh, I have to get all


383
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:25,996
of those screen shots
localized or the privacy URL.


384
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,986
So let's take a look at
the store real quick.


385
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,176
App icons.


386
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:33,566
One for the app, one
for the watch app,


387
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,506
hopefully you guys are
doing an app preview.


388
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:40,066
We also have five
screen shots per device.


389
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,116
Just refreshing this
in your head right now.


390
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:44,556
Of course, now we take
Apple Watch screen shots.


391
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:49,196
Starting counting how
many screen shots.


392
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,826
Five per device and
28 localizations.


393
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:53,796
We have app descriptions.


394
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:56,146
We want to draw people
into your app


395
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:57,156
and make sure they
understand how


396
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,216
to use it before they buy it.


397
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:02,716
If it has a new version,
it's what's new text.


398
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:06,076
And privacy policies and
especially if it's a kid's app


399
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:08,306
and EULAs and all
of these things


400
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,336
that you need to get together.


401
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,866
I think that's 840
screen shots possible.


402
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,366
We did the math there.


403
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,156
You know, fancy!


404
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:18,786
And we make it really easy on
iTunes Connect to get them in.


405
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,826
We have the drag and drop
wells that we reintroduced


406
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:24,066
and separated the sections and
made it a really powerful tool.


407
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,586
But maybe you have
more than one app.


408
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,446
Maybe you are updating your
screen shots frequently.


409
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:33,186
Maybe you have lots of apps and
lots of designers making all


410
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,196
of these screen shots for you.


411
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,616
Make you have a CMS system.


412
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:38,956
Maybe you have a corporate CMS
system, wouldn't it be nice


413
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,676
to hook up iTunes Connect to
your system and manage this


414
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:44,026
in an automated fashion.


415
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:47,756
And that's what we have to talk
about right now, Transporter


416
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,306
and command line automation.


417
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:51,346
Let's bring up my good
friend, Mr. Nik Uglov.


418
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:56,896
[Applause]


419
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,236
>> NIK UGLOV: Hi, everybody
my name is Nik Uglov,


420
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:02,996
I'm an engineering manager with
iTunes Store for content import.


421
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:08,206
And as Paul just showed you
and kind of gave you a hint


422
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,086
that there's quite a lot
of data for you to enter


423
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:14,016
into iTunes Connect in
order for your app to appeal


424
00:19:14,016 --> 00:19:15,986
to the widest possible audience.


425
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:19,356
The store's localized
in 28 languages.


426
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,456
So that's how many languages
you can localize the metadata


427
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:23,406
about your app for.


428
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,666
And it certainly
makes sense to reach


429
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,876
out to your potential
customers in the language


430
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,776
that they can understand.


431
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:36,186
There's up to five screen
shots to set up for each


432
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,446
of the devices that
your app runs on,


433
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:40,166
and those are localizable.


434
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,636
There rates and pricing
to set up.


435
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:46,086
In-app purchases.


436
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,006
Some of you have a few of those.


437
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:51,466
Some have hundreds, and
some have had thousands.


438
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:51,986
We have seen that.


439
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:55,216
And those are localizable.


440
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:57,726
And those have screen
shots in their own right.


441
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,136
Game Center achievements


442
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:03,946
and leaderboards also have
images and localization.


443
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,676
Are you counting?


444
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:10,206
That's quite a lot
of work there.


445
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:12,186
And for those of you who have
multiple apps on the store.


446
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:15,236
First of all, congratulations
and thank you.


447
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:17,706
But also that means that there's


448
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,146
that much more work
to do, right?


449
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:21,966
And really at that scale,


450
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,806
no matter how good a UI we will
put together in iTunes Connect,


451
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,456
it's still going to get
tedious and error-prone


452
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:28,786
to copy and paste that data.


453
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:33,246
No matter what we do,
it will not scale.


454
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:38,016
So let's take a look at
doing it some other way.


455
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:40,986
I will produce a command
line tool called Transporter


456
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:44,476
that manages inactions
between your environment


457
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:48,496
and iTunes Connect using
an app metadata XML feed.


458
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,506
The feed covers the
areas I just named,


459
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:55,826
the version level localization,
the rates and pricing,


460
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:59,566
and in-app purchases and
Game Center achievements


461
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,266
and leaderboards.


462
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:05,676
It's not new functionality
we are introducing.


463
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:09,576
We want to make sure that you
are aware of it and using it


464
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,066
and for those of you who
are new to the program --


465
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,706
new developers, by
the way, welcome --


466
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:16,796
we want to make sure that
you know that you have it


467
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:19,276
in your hands and ready
to take advantage of it.


468
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:23,296
This is a fully supported
robust functionality used


469
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:24,846
by developers like
you every day.


470
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:26,786
It's great for automation.


471
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:30,546
You are able to manage
your data in bulk.


472
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:34,296
And more intriguingly
integrate iTunes Connect


473
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,306
with your back-end systems
whatever those may be.


474
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:43,596
What I mean by that is suppose
we have already an asset


475
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:46,006
management system where the
screen shots are collected,


476
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:49,896
or maybe your contracting out
with some company that allows


477
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:51,206
to you localize that metadata


478
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:53,356
because you don't have
the speakers of all


479
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:54,536
of those languages in house.


480
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,436
So you take it back and you
need to park it somewhere.


481
00:21:57,436 --> 00:22:00,916
You are holding it somewhere and
you have some sort of process


482
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,416
that works for your company.


483
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,166
At that point, if you
have a system like this


484
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:09,516
or you are thinking of setting
it up, it becomes just a matter


485
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:13,096
of an XML export into a format
that we are about to see,


486
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:19,446
hook it up with Transporter and
put together a little harness


487
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:21,776
to capture any validation
messages we might send back


488
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,106
and you are on the
way to automate.


489
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,836
So a few basic rules.


490
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:31,136
The app itself, and the
version that you are trying


491
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:33,296
to target must already
exist in iTunes Connect.


492
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,636
You set those up first
and you are ready to go.


493
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,646
All of these state transitions
are done in iTunes Connect,


494
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,036
like submitting your
app for review


495
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:44,936
or submitting in-app
purchases for review.


496
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:48,226
The app binaries are
uploaded the same way they are


497
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:50,916
through today, through
Xcode or application loader.


498
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:52,606
No change.


499
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,536
And the feed itself is available


500
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:57,606
for iOS apps and
Mac apps equally.


501
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:02,726
So how does this work?


502
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,016
First of all, it's a
two-way communication.


503
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:08,216
You use Transporter,
the command line tool,


504
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,876
and the first thing I suggest
you do is do a metadata lookup.


505
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:16,996
What this does is it retrieves
onto your local environment,


506
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,576
the current state
of the app metadata


507
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:22,046
as we have it in iTunes Connect.


508
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:24,866
So you download it in
a form of a package


509
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,886
which is just a fancy
word for a directory named


510
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:29,086
after your app SKU with
a .itmsp extension.


511
00:23:30,096 --> 00:23:31,126
You crack one of those open


512
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:33,636
and you find a metadata
XML file in there.


513
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,996
This is the expression of
all the metadata we have


514
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:41,226
for your app so far and this
is the file that you would use


515
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:43,416
to make changes to
iTunes Connect.


516
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:47,096
You edit that file and you
add some screen shots to it,


517
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,546
any other assets
that you need to add.


518
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:52,256
You validate it, to make sure
that it passes all the rules


519
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:54,256
and if its, go ahead and upload.


520
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:58,066
So this forms a life
cycle of your interactions


521
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,296
with iTunes Connect
using Transporter.


522
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:06,736
Download the package, edit XML
and add assets to it, validate,


523
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,956
and upload and repeat
over time as necessary


524
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,736
to achieve the edits
you are trying to get.


525
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:15,876
Let's take a look
at the commands.


526
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:18,166
This is for the metadata lookup.


527
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,506
This is to get the
information from us.


528
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:25,626
The command is iTMSTransporter
and the first method


529
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:28,906
or mode you want to explore
is the look up metadata.


530
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:33,596
Use your iTunes Connect user
name and you identify the app


531
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,886
that you are interested
in by the vendor ID.


532
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,246
The vendor ID is your app's SKU.


533
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:41,996
Not the bundle ID, not the
Apple ID, that's the app SKU.


534
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:47,866
Give where you would like
this to be deposited in.


535
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:52,536
You will get the
metadata XML data inside


536
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:58,206
and the reason I recommend
that you start this way is


537
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,006
that it's a lot easier
to start by example.


538
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:03,496
You are going to get a large
file captures all the details


539
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:06,796
and it's valid by definition


540
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,736
because it's actually
emitted from the store.


541
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:12,156
So you will see all the areas
where you can make edits to it


542
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:14,196
and it's a lot easier to put
it together than to start


543
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:17,786
from scratch from a spec. So
let's say you took that advice


544
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:20,996
and you added keywords and
added some screen shots


545
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:23,156
and a localization.


546
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:26,096
Go ahead and validate it.


547
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:31,276
Same command, Transporter,
different mode, verify.


548
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:36,536
You use your iTunes Connect
user name, and supply a path


549
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,516
to the package that you
have been working on.


550
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:40,176
That's the one that
has the metadata XML


551
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:41,346
and all the assets
that you have added.


552
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:44,806
So what is going to
happen here is we are going


553
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:47,916
to use exactly the same
rules that we apply


554
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,956
on iTunes Connect the web GUI,


555
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,076
to validate what
you have September.


556
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:52,886
We will check all the I.Ds.


557
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,766
We will check all the
required fields and the lengths


558
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:58,486
of the field and the
dimensions of the screen shots


559
00:25:58,486 --> 00:25:59,656
that you are sending
to make sure


560
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,446
that they match the
devices that they are for.


561
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:04,296
If there are any errors,
we will report it back


562
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,416
to you right on the
command line.


563
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:07,956
And if you don't
have any errors,


564
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:09,786
then go ahead and upload it.


565
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:12,946
This is the same command,
transporter, iTMSTransporter


566
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:16,146
with a different mode, upload.


567
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:16,956
That's the only difference.


568
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:22,856
Your iTunes Connect user name
and the path to the package


569
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:24,766
that you have been
putting together all along.


570
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,866
So what's going to happen here
is we are going to actually run


571
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,226
through the validation mode
first, in case you skipped it,


572
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:31,256
we will apply it anyways.


573
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,366
Same rules as would
apply in iTunes Connect.


574
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:38,196
If there are any errors, they
will be reported back to you


575
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,696
and the upload will be blocked.


576
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,076
If there are no errors then
the app upload will succeed


577
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:47,226
and we will get it
on our servers and at


578
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:49,276
that point it's asynchronous.


579
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,696
So it's in the queue
to be processed,


580
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:57,616
alongside the binaries and
any other content we process.


581
00:26:58,136 --> 00:27:02,286
And it might take a
minute or two for it to be,


582
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:04,426
as we say ingested and
appear on iTunes Connect.


583
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:07,876
You can actually use one of the
commands in Transporter to look


584
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:12,406
up the current state
of that process.


585
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,066
In order to take
advantage of all of this,


586
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,226
there are two pieces of
documentation that you need.


587
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,546
They are available
on the resources


588
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:20,046
and the help screen
on iTunes Connect.


589
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:23,016
The app metadata
specification for all the tags


590
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:26,206
and a Transporter user
guide for all the commands


591
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:28,646
and all the options
which is a lot more


592
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,676
than I will go through here.


593
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:30,286
All right.


594
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:34,306
We are ready to see that XML.


595
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,026
So this is what it
would look like.


596
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:37,806
This is how metadata
XML would look like.


597
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:42,516
There are required elements
forming a sort of envelope


598
00:27:42,516 --> 00:27:43,426
around everything else.


599
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:48,126
So you have the package,
for your team ID.


600
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,846
You have software because this
is what we are discussing here,


601
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:52,076
right?


602
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:56,326
Your app is identified by the
vendor ID which is the app SKU


603
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,836
and then the software metadata


604
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:00,406
because this is what
you are about to send.


605
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:04,916
Everything else is
optional elements.


606
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:08,906
They are optional in the
sense that only those


607
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:09,926
that have some changes,


608
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,246
only those that you
actually need to send in.


609
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,916
So, for example, if you
are making some changes


610
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,386
to the purchases, just
send that section.


611
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:19,826
This is not to say that you
can't send the whole thing


612
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:20,276
back in.


613
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:21,676
It is going to work fine.


614
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:23,866
Let's say you followed
that advice I had


615
00:28:24,326 --> 00:28:25,996
about doing a metadata
lookup first.


616
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:30,476
You got the package and made
a few minor edits and decided


617
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,016
to send the whole thing
back in, perfectly fine.


618
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:33,596
That will work.


619
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:36,276
We are capable of seeing
where the changes are


620
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:38,636
and applying those and ignoring
the sections that didn't change.


621
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,946
It's all up to you
how to structure it.


622
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:47,306
So diving in, into this
-- into the package here,


623
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:49,706
just to call your
attention to the team ID,


624
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:51,676
is a value that you
received originally


625
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:53,366
when you created your
team account with Apple


626
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,596
and your app is identified
by the vendor ID


627
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:57,816
which is the app's SKU.


628
00:28:58,376 --> 00:29:03,966
And the next step
depends on what it is


629
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:05,616
that you are trying to do.


630
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:07,096
Which area are you editing?


631
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,366
Let's say you are editing
some localization --


632
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,286
something about localization,
adding a description


633
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:11,946
or something like that.


634
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:16,536
Just like in iTunes Connect,
you get to select one of up


635
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:19,676
to two versions that you
are trying to target.


636
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:22,536
The one that's currently
on the store


637
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:23,896
and maybe the one
you are building


638
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,886
up for the next release.


639
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:27,126
So in the XML, would you do


640
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:31,066
that by using the iTunes Connect
version stream, version 1.5


641
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:34,016
or the 2.0 in this example.


642
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:38,136
And for the sake of argument,
let's say you are interested


643
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:39,516
in editing the 2.0 version.


644
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:42,406
So the next slide is we
are diving down into that,


645
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:44,146
and what's the next step?


646
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:46,516
Select a language you
are talking about.


647
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:49,896
So let's say in the -- in
iTunes Connect, would you do


648
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:52,206
that by using a pull
down for English.


649
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:55,176
In the XML, it would be locale,


650
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:59,766
name and the BCP47 tag
identifying the language.


651
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:03,406
BCP47 is a format --


652
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:05,586
is a standard for
identifying any language spoken


653
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:08,596
on this planet, and I
think a few off the planet.


654
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,686
But they are only ones
that you can only use


655
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:14,236
in the feed are the ones that
the store is localized in.


656
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,306
So those are 28 and
they are listed


657
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:19,446
in the spec. Please take a look.


658
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:25,786
Let's say ENUS for US English
and diving further down.


659
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:28,426
Now we are finally down to
the actual data elements.


660
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:32,236
We have the title which is the
app name and the description.


661
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,296
We have the version
of what's new


662
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:35,346
if it happens to be an update.


663
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,196
And really, any element that
you encounter in iTunes Connect


664
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:43,356
at this point has a
representative tag in the XML.


665
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:46,066
I won't go through all of
them, other than to stay


666
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:48,136
for a few seconds
on screen shots


667
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:49,916
because those are just
a bit more involved.


668
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,836
For each screen shot,
you would need


669
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:56,456
to tell us what device
they are for.


670
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:59,616
So that's the dismay target
and all of the iPhones


671
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:02,346
and Apple Watch and
iPad and if it happens


672
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,506
to be a Mac app is
the option there


673
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:07,906
and which position you want
that screen shot to appear


674
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,136
on the store and they go
from one to five, remember,


675
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:11,356
up to five per device.


676
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:15,266
Specify the size of
the file in bytes.


677
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:19,166
The file name, which is of the
file that you would park next


678
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,936
to metadata XML in the package,


679
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:25,416
give us the MD5 checksum,
and onwards.


680
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:30,666
Let's say what you
wanted to do is set


681
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,206
up some pricing parameters
instead.


682
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,636
Like in iTunes Connect, and
I think you might be picking


683
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:38,516
up a theme here, that it's --
it's -- they are equivalent.


684
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,966
Most of these are
applicable worldwide.


685
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,296
So the XML product
equivalent section is


686
00:31:45,426 --> 00:31:47,476
in the product for territory WW.


687
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:51,896
And at that level, you get to
state what your available date


688
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:54,516
for the app is, the sales
start date and things


689
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:58,956
like the educational
discount and also still


690
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:03,016
on the same level, also
territory WW for worldwide,


691
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:05,446
what is the pricing
tier for your app?


692
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:09,046
So here's wholesale price
Tier 3, corresponding


693
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:13,206
to the same option in the GUI
and the effective dates of it,


694
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:15,686
the start date and the end date.


695
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:20,696
Notice for a second that those
appear inside an interval tag,


696
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:23,876
which is itself an interval
section and what that builds


697
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:27,616
up to is the ability to do
this advanced scheduling


698
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:28,606
of your price changes.


699
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:32,256
So in iTunes Connect, for
example, here's a map that goes


700
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,936
on sale today for
five days, right?


701
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:38,156
Price Tier 3 goes down to price
Tier 1 and then comes back to 3,


702
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,346
exactly the same
way in the feed.


703
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:46,786
You have the initial interval,
and the wholesale Price Tier 3


704
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:53,646
and then it goes down to Tier 1
for five days and back up to 3.


705
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:57,016
Notice no end date there, which
means it's effective forever,


706
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,836
until you decide to change
that with a next update.


707
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:05,916
What is available on
the per territory basis,


708
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,006
per country basis?


709
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:10,016
It's just the setting of whether
your app is available there


710
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:10,336
or not.


711
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,606
You can do that by
exclusion or inclusion.


712
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:15,016
In exclusion, you state
that it's available


713
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:17,726
for sale everywhere,
and then enumerate


714
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:20,376
through territories specifically
like Japan over there,


715
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:22,846
where you don't want the app
to be available for sale.


716
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,226
So that's one option.


717
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:27,316
The other one is inclusion,
exactly the opposite.


718
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,876
For territory WW, your app
is not available for sale,


719
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,966
meaning it's just not
clear for sale anywhere.


720
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:36,436
And spend specifically
enumerate the areas


721
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:40,286
where you want to
make it available.


722
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,996
In-app purchases.


723
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,866
This is the area where you can
probably get the most effect,


724
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,646
the most bang for the
buck for using the feed.


725
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:50,986
That's due to the sheer
number of in-app purchases


726
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:51,956
that some of your apps have.


727
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,116
This is where we have
seen the most activity


728
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:59,166
and this is a deep
enough section of the feed


729
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,006
that I won't go through
the tags here.


730
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,636
Please download the
documentation,


731
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:04,326
take a look there.


732
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:07,786
It's fully supported, what you
can do in the web interface,


733
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:09,406
you can do in the feed.


734
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,626
The same goes for
leaderboards and achievements.


735
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,076
Fully supported.


736
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:18,966
Everything you can do in a
web GUI, you can do in a feed.


737
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:20,536
Please download the
documentation,


738
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:25,676
study it, and take advantage.


739
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:30,856
So in summary, what you have
able to you is Transporter,


740
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:34,166
the command line tool for
managing the interactions


741
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,795
in your environment
and iTunes Connect


742
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:40,485
and app metadata XML feed for
all the areas that we covered.


743
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:44,216
And those are great
for automation.


744
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:47,966
They allow you to manage your
data in iTunes Connect in bulk.


745
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:51,016
You can get out of the
copy/paste business.


746
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,536
And you can integrate
iTunes Connect


747
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:55,755
with your back-end systems.


748
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:56,585
Whatever those may be.


749
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,326
So get your hands on two
pieces of information,


750
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:05,306
app metadata XML
feed for all the tags


751
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:09,786
and all the formats there
and Transporter user guide


752
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,636
for all the commands and
all the options to them.


753
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:14,846
And automate away!


754
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:17,746
And with that, back
to Paul and thank you.


755
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:23,546
[Applause]


756
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:24,266
>> PAUL TURNER: Okay.


757
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:24,626
Thanks, Nik.


758
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:25,396
That was great.


759
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:26,676
Oh, my gosh!


760
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:28,786
I'm so lucky to work
with engineers like this.


761
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,056
All right, we are a
little pressed for time


762
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:31,206
and I will wrap it
up really quickly.


763
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:32,616
I want to let you know


764
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:37,066
that 1-800 song already
chartered on Apple Music.


765
00:35:37,066 --> 00:35:38,826
You will see me at
the Grammys next year.


766
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,826
We took a look at
help resources.


767
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:43,706
I hope you use them.


768
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:44,656
Give us feedback on them.


769
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,206
I want to know what you need.


770
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:52,186
We took a look at TestFlight,
went over the resources


771
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:54,576
and then Nik's Transporter
and XML feeds.


772
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,846
For more information,
obviously the developer portal.


773
00:35:57,846 --> 00:36:01,086
And you can contact our fearless
evangelist, Marc Malone.


774
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:03,996
Some related sessions
already happened


775
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,276
but catch them on the replay.


776
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:08,286
The What's New in iTunes Connect
this morning was fantastic!


777
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:11,566
The App Analytics
lab was incredible.


778
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:13,366
I'm so happy that
you guys are here.


779
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:14,976
So come visit us and
have a great conference!


780
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:19,500
[Applause]
