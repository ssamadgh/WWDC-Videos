>> Hi, everyone.


4
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:27,606
Good morning.


5
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:29,796
Welcome to our session,


6
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:31,136
Introducing Business Chat


7
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:32,526
Developer Preview.


8
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:33,946
My name is Grant.


9
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,366
And today, I'm going to give you


10
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:36,596
an overview of what Business


11
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:38,836
Chat is and some of the new


12
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:39,486
features.


13
00:00:40,276 --> 00:00:42,166
We'll also cover today what you


14
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,486
can do during the developer


15
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:46,046
preview to get ready before the


16
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,506
public launch next year.


17
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:50,736
Later, my friend, Scotty, is


18
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:52,086
going to come up and he's going


19
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,786
to give us a demo of something


20
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,276
we're calling Business Chat


21
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:56,046
Sandbox.


22
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:58,436
It's a great tool that going to


23
00:00:58,436 --> 00:01:01,706
help you develop and test all


24
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:02,706
your solutions so that you're


25
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:03,866
ready for the public launch.


26
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,146
Are you ready?


27
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,186
Let's begin.


28
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,926
So the telephone has served us


29
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,616
well as customers but it's not


30
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,406
always the most ideal way to


31
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:15,566
communicate with businesses.


32
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,036
Business Chat is important


33
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,036
because it offers a more


34
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:21,076
flexible and more capable


35
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:21,856
experience.


36
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:24,986
For example, sometimes you're


37
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,336
busy, you're running around.


38
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:28,446
You need a way to resolve issues


39
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:30,066
without dedicating your time to


40
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:30,696
a phone call.


41
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,076
And you definitely don't want to


42
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:34,566
waste your time waiting on hold.


43
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,036
You need a way to communicate in


44
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,576
between the million other things


45
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,606
that you're doing, a way to


46
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,406
communicate on your schedule.


47
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:46,826
And a telephone call is not


48
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,956
visual and it's definitely not


49
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,176
as capable as an iPhone.


50
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:52,496
Sometimes you need to show the


51
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:53,876
business what you're seeing.


52
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,526
You might have an unfamiliar


53
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:58,156
product or need help with it or


54
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,856
maybe while you're chatting, you


55
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,016
might need to do something


56
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:04,616
interactive like choosing from


57
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:07,756
different options, scheduling an


58
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,326
appointment, making a payment,


59
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,046
or even interacting with an app


60
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,106
and that's Business Chat.


61
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:18,606
It's a powerful way for


62
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,006
customers to communicate with


63
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,366
you and to complete tasks.


64
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:24,000

00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:31,366

00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:35,406

71
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,116

76
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:49,476
questions.


77
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:51,326
Help them learn more about your


78
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:52,766
products and link them straight


79
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:53,636
to the information they're


80
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:54,000
looking for.


81
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:58,186
Your customers can always come


82
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:59,686
right back to chat again and


83
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,066
with long-lived sessions, you'll


84
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,786
be ready with their information,


85
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,646
so it's easy for them and easy


86
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,000
for you.


87
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:09,576
If customers already have a


88
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:11,506
product in mind, they can make


89
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:12,516
their purchase right in the


90
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:13,896

92
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:18,166
Integration with Apple Pay means


93
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:19,976
customers can pay securely with


94
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:21,000
just one touch.


95
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,086

make sure that we get this


114
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:07,356
right.


115
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:09,536
We know that elevating the

117
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:12,666

It's going to take some time.


119

And we wanted to give you an

00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,505
opportunity to get connected and


121
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,196
to integrate Business Chat into

During the Developer Preview,


125
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,126
Business Chat will be

00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,906

128
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:31,496

00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,116

white list some of your


131
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,926

132
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,696
test your end-to-end experience


133
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:40,166
to make sure that you're ready.


134
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:45,056
So let's talk about how we're


135
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,446
making it easy for your


136
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:48,726
customers to find you and to


137
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,006
start a conversation with your

00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:50,496
business.


139
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:53,106
Once you have your Business Chat


140
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:54,916
account, message buttons will


141
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,706
start appearing throughout iOS.


142
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,446
For example, this is how it


143
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:01,366
would look in Safari.


144
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,856
Customer might type your website


145
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,036
and a search result would appear


146
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,346
that highlights your business.


147
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,566
In this example, the user typed


148
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,786
"apple" and the search result


149
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,656
shows the nearby Apple Union


150
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:15,436
Square location.


151
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:17,566
And you can see that the message


152
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:18,926
button is prominently featured.


153
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:21,806
Your user can start a


154
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:24,076
conversation right from here


155
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:25,086
instead of hunting on the


156
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:25,976
website for contact information.


157
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:31,506
Here is the Message button in


158
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:36,096
Search and in Siri and in Maps


159
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,136
too.


160
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,926
The Message button can appear


161
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:42,116
for each one of your store


162
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:42,926
locations.


163
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,586
We are also adding new support


164
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,106
for businesses that don't have


165
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,896
locations, including those that


166
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:52,696
might be online or app only.


167
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:54,866
Now if you're an online


168
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,346
business, or if there're no


169
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:57,406
nearby locations, there will


170
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:58,806
still be a search result


171
00:05:58,806 --> 00:05:59,766
available for you.


172
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:01,986
This is how search results might


173
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,116
look in Safari if Apple had no


174
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:05,476
nearby store locations.


175
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:10,406
Links are another great entry


176
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,316
point that you can use to invite


177
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,076
your customers into your


178
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:15,396
Business Chat conversation.


179
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:18,466
You can put links on your


180
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:21,516
websites, in your app, and in


181
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:22,256
your emails.


182
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:24,846
When your customer taps your


183
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,056
link, it will open your Business


184
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,416
Chat conversation on supporting


185
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,576
devices within the Messages app.


186
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,936
To create your link, you'll need


187
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,706
your Business Chat ID, which you


188
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,076
will receive after you create


189
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,366
your account.


190
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,586
The next feature that I'd like


191
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,146
to review is something called


192
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:47,836
Chat Intent.


193
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:51,296
Chat Intent is a great way to


194
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:52,746
provide better support to your


195
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,136
customers by helping you


196
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,116
understand the context of their


197
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:57,626
question.


198
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,096
When you create links, you can


199
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,996
tag them to identify where your


200
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:05,586
customer tapped or clicked it.


201
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,456
There are two Chat Intent values


202
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,316
that you can use.


203
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,796
The first one is called intent


204
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:14,796
ID and the second one is group


205
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:16,466
ID, and they're completely


206
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:16,936
optional.


207
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:18,876
They could be whatever you need


208
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:19,346
them to be.


209
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,146
When your customer taps your


210
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:24,426
link and that link contains Chat


211
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,856
Intent values, those values will


212
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:28,266
be passed back to you with the


213
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:28,836
next message.


214
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:30,766
Let's see how you might use


215
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:30,976
them.


216
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:36,846
Let's say your customer is


217
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,726
browsing one of your products


218
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,196
and has a question about it.


219
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:42,806
You could use Chat Intent to


220
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:44,626
know the product config so your


221
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,206
customer doesn't need to type it


222
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:46,506
out.


223
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:50,346
For example, you could put the


224
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,436
product details or the product


225
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:55,126
code into the Intent field so


226
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:56,556
that your support agent can


227
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,526
provide a faster answer to your


228
00:07:58,786 --> 00:07:59,000
customer.


229
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,456
Or maybe you have different


230
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:04,066
internal teams that offer


231
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,476
specialized support, you could


232
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,666
use Chat Intent to route


233
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,946
messages to the relevant


234
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:09,786
internal team.


235
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:12,846
In this case, you could put the


236
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:14,686
team code into the group field


237
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:16,236
and that way you could route


238
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:17,846
incoming messages to the team


239
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:19,296
that handles that particular


240
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:19,626
issue.


241
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:24,466
And sometimes your customers may


242
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,956
want to chat with one of your


243
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:27,206
particular locations.


244
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:29,996
In the future, you will be able


245
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:32,346
to provide your locations and


246
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,885
your location IDs to Apple Maps.


247
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,126
Apple will automatically then


248
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:39,405
populate the Intent field with


249
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:40,556
your location ID.


250
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,506
That way when the customer taps


251
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:47,296
the message and sends their


252
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,066
message to that location, you


253
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,076
will know to which location they


254
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:53,216
were directing their message and


255
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,236
then you will be able to route


256
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:55,276
the message appropriately.


257
00:08:55,926 --> 00:09:00,036
So we just reviewed all the ways


258
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,606
that your business might be


259
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:02,556
found by your customer.


260
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:05,246
But once your customer taps that


261
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,196
Message button, they are then


262
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:09,156
taken to your conversation


263
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:10,836
inside of the Messages app.


264
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:12,956
So let's explore some of the


265
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,726
features of those Business Chat


266
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:15,586
conversations.


267
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,956
It's important to note that your


268
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:21,426
customer must send the first


269
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,006
message to open the


270
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:23,726
conversation.


271
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,976
But once that conversation is


272
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:28,016
open, you can then message back


273
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,206
or send important notifications.


274
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,126
With your customer's message,


275
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,226
you will also receive that


276
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,046
customer's opaque ID.


277
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:40,376
This is a unique ID designed to


278
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,816
preserve their anonymity until


279
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,716
they're ready to share more


280
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:45,136
personal information with you.


281
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:48,476
In addition, you will also


282
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:50,896
receive the customer's language


283
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:53,956
and device region so that you


284
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,396
can route their message to the


285
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,276
internal team that's best


286
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:58,626
equipped to answer their


287
00:09:58,626 --> 00:09:58,976
question.


288
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:04,016
As we saw in the video, the


289
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,796
conversation session is long


290
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:06,006
lived.


291
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,336
Your customer can return and


292
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:10,636
pick up where they left off at


293
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:11,206
any time.


294
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,666
They should be able to just jump


295
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,066
in and ask a quick question


296
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:16,906
without having to re-identify


297
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:17,546
themselves.


298
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:19,646
And you can have their account


299
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:21,696
information ready so they can


300
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:23,536
get help without wasting time


301
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,916
describing what you should


302
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,936
already know.


303
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:30,676
After your customer sends the


304
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,416
first message, you might need


305
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,346
some personal details to assist


306
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:34,556
them.


307
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,376
So let's say you needed their


308
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:36,986
phone number.


309
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,296
You might ask and the QuickType


310
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:42,026
keyboard will make intelligent


311
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,136
suggestions so your customer can


312
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:47,226
reply with just a tap.


313
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,966
The QuickType keyboard can make


314
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,666
intelligent suggestions so your


315
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,226
customers can easily provide


316
00:10:52,226 --> 00:10:54,586
their email address, their phone


317
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,996
number, their postal address,


318
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:01,506
and even their location.


319
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:04,636
Messages is a very personal


320
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,026
area.


321
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:07,046
This is where your customers


322
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,456
communicate with their friends


323
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:08,926
and family.


324
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:11,826
It's important to us that users


325
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,506
never receive unsolicited


326
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,176
messages.


327
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,506
We wanted to give users full


328
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:17,396
control over their


329
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:18,936
communications with businesses.


330
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:21,436
Users can manage their


331
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:23,736
conversations by hiding alerts


332
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:25,836
or by deleting the conversation.


333
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:29,696
When they hide alerts, they will


334
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:31,706
continue to receive messages but


335
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:32,766
they won't be notified.


336
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:34,246
And if they delete the


337
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:36,066
conversation, that will block


338
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,546
all future messages from you.


339
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,456
Next, attachments.


340
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,546
Because Business Chat is within


341
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:46,216
the Messages app, Business Chat


342
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:47,656
supports all of the standard


343
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,796
attachment types like photos,


344
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:52,596
videos, and documents.


345
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,546
For example, your customer might


346
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,386
send a photo of a product they


347
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:59,796
might need, or your customer


348
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,806
might send a video of an area of


349
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:03,626
their house to help you provide


350
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:05,936
a more accurate quote and you


351
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,776
can use attachments to send


352
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:09,126
forms or other important


353
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:09,706
information.


354
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,056
Next, let's cover some ways that


355
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,456
you can provide a better


356
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:17,766
experience to your customers.


357
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,016
We wanted to create some


358
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,046
built-in features that help you


359
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,346
provide a consistent engaging


360
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,326
experience for some common use


361
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:26,766
cases.


362
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,306
It's important to note that


363
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:31,426
these features are built in, so


364
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,926
they're available for you even


365
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,286
if you don't have your own app.


366
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:38,266
The first is Time Picker.


367
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,226
Scheduling appointments is a


368
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,306
common use case.


369
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:45,356
You can use Time Picker to send


370
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,566
over a list of proposed times to


371
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,636
your customer to review.


372
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,366
Your customer can see if they


373
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,176
have a conflict with existing


374
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:54,176
appointments that they might


375
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:54,956
have in Calendar.


376
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:58,196
Your customer can review and


377
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,246
then choose the best option and


378
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:04,206
send their choice back to you.


379
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:06,116
Choosing from a list of options


380
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:07,706
is also another common use case.


381
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:09,956
We created List Picker so you


382
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,876
can provide a visual way to make


383
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:12,436
a selection.


384
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:16,246
With List Picker, you can send


385
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,096
your customer a list of options.


386
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,016
Your customer can select one or


387
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,686
more, depending on how you


388
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,106
configured it, and then send a


389
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,156
choice back to you.


390
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:30,716
Lastly, we know that payments is


391
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:31,856
another common use case.


392
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,796
Apple Pay provides an easy and


393
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:37,876
secure way to pay.


394
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,306
And if you're also a retailer


395
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:40,516
that wants a quick check-out


396
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:43,006
process, customers can quickly


397
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,526
and securely provide their


398
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:47,186
payment, shipping, and contact


399
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:49,196
information and then check out


400
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:49,966
with just one touch.


401
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,416
The built-in features that we


402
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,886
just covered offer a great


403
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:00,486
experience for some common use


404
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:00,866
cases.


405
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,726
But we know that these just


406
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,076
scratch the surface of what's


407
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:04,396
needed.


408
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,936
To customize the experience for


409
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:09,156
your business, you can extend


410
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,706
Business Chat by using the


411
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:12,566
iMessage app framework released


412
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,476
last year in iOS 10.


413
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:18,936
With the Messages framework, you


414
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:20,986
can create app experiences that


415
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,736
your customers can use directly


416
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,906
within Business Chat.


417
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,686
Essentially, you can pull in


418
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:28,156
parts of your app into the


419
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:30,116
conversation just when your


420
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,086
customer needs it.


421
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:33,456
Your app can appear like a


422
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,136
message bubble.


423
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,386
For example, if the customer


424
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:37,706
needed to select their seats,


425
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:39,126
they could get a bubble like


426
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:42,436
this, tap it, and then quickly


427
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,000
complete the task.


428
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:53,596
[ Applause ]


429
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:55,896
With iMessage apps, you can


430
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:57,616
speed customers through common


431
00:14:57,616 --> 00:14:59,436
issues and improve your support


432
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:00,326
team productivity.


433
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,456
And Business Chat is a great way


434
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,176
to introduce customers to your


435
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:06,356
app.


436
00:15:07,496 --> 00:15:08,816
If your customer doesn't yet


437
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,426
have your app installed, they


438
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,016
can tap to get the app right


439
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:14,000
from within the conversation.


440
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:18,256
You can use your app to


441
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:20,436
customize the look and behavior


442
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,306
of Messages using Live Message


443
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:22,706
layouts.


444
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,706
You can customize the bubble,


445
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:27,766
for example, by adding a map or


446
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,456
a live countdown, a simple form,


447
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,176
or any other interaction that


448
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:35,306
you create using your app.


449
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:39,036
To learn more about how to


450
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:40,946
create iMessage apps, go to


451
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:44,526
developer.apple.com/imessage.


452
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:49,416
Next, let's talk about getting


453
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:49,926
connected.


454
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:53,886
As a business, you're going to


455
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,666
need a customer service platform


456
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,216
that supports Business Chat.


457
00:15:58,756 --> 00:15:59,926
Your platform will help you


458
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,856
connect, route messages


459
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,636
internally, and provide


460
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:04,826
productivity tools for your


461
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:05,116
team.


462
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,326
Your platform will also help


463
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,116
connect your apps into your


464
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:11,226
support operations.


465
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:13,936
This is so that your team can


466
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:16,796
send app experiences to your


467
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:18,826
customers.


468
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,316
As a business, you need to apply


469
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,326
for the developer preview at


470
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:24,696
register.apple.com.


471
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:28,186
Likewise, if you are a customer


472
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,646
service platform that supports


473
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,976
Messaging, you can also apply to


474
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,296
offer Business Chat to your


475
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:34,776
clients too.


476
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:39,996
So once your account is approved


477
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:42,056
for Business Chat, you could


478
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:43,226
receive messages from Apple


479
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:43,816
devices.


480
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:45,946
Let's say your customer sends a


481
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:46,596
message to you.


482
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,546
This message will first arrive


483
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:50,146
on Apple's Business Chat server.


484
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,966
From there, messages are passed


485
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:54,156
to your customer service


486
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:58,056
platform, and then your platform


487
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:00,076
will route messages to the


488
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,626
appropriate person or team


489
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:02,866
within your business.


490
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,876
When they respond, your message


491
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:07,096
is routed back to your customer.


492
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,445
As I mentioned, during Business


493
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,596
Chat developer preview, your


494
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:13,996
business is not yet publicly


495
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:14,566
accessible.


496
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,185
However, you can white list


497
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:19,076
employees and these employees


498
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:20,606
can test the full experience,


499
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,476
interact with your iMessage


500
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:23,935
apps, and make sure that


501
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,536
everything is working properly.


502
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:30,516
OK, let's go through how to get


503
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:30,956
started.


504
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,726
There are three things that you


505
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:34,506
can do today.


506
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:36,956
First, start developing.


507
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:38,756
You can use the Business Chat


508
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:40,326
Sandbox that Scotty will take us


509
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,036
through next.


510
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,556
Second, get connected on a


511
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,066
customer service platform that


512
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,146
supports Business Chat.


513
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:50,616
And then, apply for early access


514
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:51,986
to Business Chat.


515
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,876
With that, Scotty will take us


516
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,006
through a demo Business Chat


517
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:59,026
Sandbox and how you can use it


518
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:01,376
to start developing and testing


519
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:02,476
your use cases.


520
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:07,500
[ Applause ]


521
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:14,786
>> Alright, thanks, Grant.


522
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,516
We're real excited about


523
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:18,106
Business Chat.


524
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:20,336
We have developed an entire


525
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:21,906
platform that will allow


526
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:23,386
everyone to communicate with


527
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,496
businesses directly through one


528
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:26,986
of the most used apps on the


529
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,056
planet, Messages.


530
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:31,186
And, as you've seen, we've built


531
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,576
in some great software into


532
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,676
every iOS 11 device that makes


533
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,176
performing these common business


534
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:39,216
tasks simple and fun, including


535
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:41,416
making payments using Apple Pay,


536
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,676
way better than trying to give


537
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:44,636
your credit card information


538
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:45,256
over the phone.


539
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:48,866
And it's even way more secure.


540
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,416
Now, you can mix these built-in


541
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,176
features with your own custom


542
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,826
messages apps that you create


543
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:00,396
and we think there's some real


544
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:01,856
opportunity here for you to


545
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:03,936
create some new really amazing


546
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,346
customer engagement experiences.


547
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,046
Now we were so excited about all


548
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,396
of this, we wanted everyone to


549
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,416
be able to try this out today


550
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,966
using your iOS 11 device.


551
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:16,826
As message app developers, you


552
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:18,006
can try integrating with your


553
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:18,706
messages apps.


554
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:20,606
As customer service platforms,


555
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:22,126
you can see what formats we're


556
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,256
sending over the wire, or as a


557
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:25,636
business owner or someone who's


558
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:27,186
just interested, you can use the


559
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,166
Sandbox to dream up the next


560
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,796
great customer experience


561
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:31,516
engagement.


562
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,696
So what did we do?


563
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:38,066
Well, as Grant showed, we have


564
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:39,666
this flow of information that


565
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,466
goes through and what we've


566
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:42,906
created as the Sandbox is a way


567
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:44,956
-- Sandbox is pretty much like


568
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:46,006
your own customer service


569
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:47,946
platform that we've created and


570
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:49,476
we've put a web frontend on it.


571
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,306
Now your business might have its


572
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,016
own web frontend but in this


573
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:54,616
case, this is a Sandbox


574
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,656
environment and you can use to


575
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,926
play and we think it'll be great


576
00:19:57,926 --> 00:19:58,866
so you can experience these


577
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,316
features.


578
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,356
So instead of talking about it,


579
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:01,896
let me give you a demo right


580
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:01,963
now.

00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:06,496
So I'm going to switch over to


582
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:09,556
the demo device here and I have


583
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,696
loaded up here the website for


584
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:12,856
Business Chat Sandbox on the


585
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,036
left and I have an iPhone here


586
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:15,696
on the right.


587
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:19,206
And as Grant mentioned, the


588
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:20,796
interactions with businesses


589
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:22,596
have to be started by your iOS


590
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:22,916
device.


591
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:24,836
Grant highlighted a lot of great


592
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:26,976
ways that you can get to your


593
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,166
Business Chat through things


594
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,116
like Maps and Siri, but another


595
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:32,346
great way is QR codes.


596
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,586
And this has highlighted a new


597
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:36,336
feature on iOS 11 where you can


598
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,706
use your camera app to hover


599
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,856
over a QR code, which I'm going


600
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:44,856
to do now, and you'll see up


601
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:48,026
pops a message notification.


602
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:50,986
I can just tap this guy and I'm


603
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:52,176
brought right into messages


604
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:53,276
ready to start a communication


605
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:53,976
with Business Chat Sandbox.


606
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:58,876
[ Applause ]


607
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,626
So keep in mind, this is the


608
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,216
setup process.


609
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,076
I have logged in with my iCloud


610
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:05,266
account to Business Chat Sandbox


611
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:06,926
and I've scanned this QR code


612
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:08,376
and I'm ready to start talking


613
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:08,846
to a business.


614
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:10,506
I don't know any other platform


615
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:11,736
that has it this easy.


616
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:14,186
So let's start sending a really


617
00:21:14,326 --> 00:21:16,436
profound message and say, "Hi."


618
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:19,946
And you'll see, boom, on the


619
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,686
left, the Business Chat Sandbox


620
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:23,116
updates since I've made


621
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,276
communication with that


622
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:24,796
business.


623
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,356
So what do we have here?


624
00:21:26,606 --> 00:21:28,866
Well, along the top we have a


625
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,066
bunch of tabs that highlight


626
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:32,196
different functionality of


627
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:33,046
Business Chat.


628
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:34,946
We have Text so you can send


629
00:21:34,946 --> 00:21:35,826
text back and forth.


630
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:37,836
We have Attachment so you can


631
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,746
try sending files and other


632
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:40,966
types of attachments back and


633
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,226
forth.


634
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:43,386
We have the Time Picker that


635
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,216
Grant highlighted.


636
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,276
We have List Picker to be able


637
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,356
to pick from a list.


638
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:49,146
We have everyone's favorite


639
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:50,936
Apple Pay to collect payments


640
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:51,526
from customers.


641
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,416
We have My App, which allows you


642
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,926
to test integrating with your


643
00:21:56,926 --> 00:21:58,406
own custom messages app.


644
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,246
And Raw JSON, which lets you try


645
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:03,696
out and modify the JSON and see


646
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:05,736
what happens when you customize


647
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:07,186
this to your business


648
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:07,616
environment.


649
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:12,096
On the right, I have a


650
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:14,086
transcript showing the


651
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,836
communications between the


652
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,116
Sandbox and my device.


653
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:22,016
And at the bottom, we have a


654
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:24,096
JSON tab, which actually shows


655
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:25,526
you the formats that we're


656
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:26,356
sending over the wire.


657
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:28,056
This is really helpful when


658
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,116
you're developing customer


659
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,016
service platforms or your own


660
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,176
messages apps to make sure


661
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:32,996
you're getting things right.


662
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,896
So as a business, over here I


663
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,526
might type a response to my


664
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,136
profound "hi" and say something


665
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:41,736
like, "How may I help you?"


666
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:45,566
And we can send that across and


667
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:47,186
you'll see that sends and, boom,


668
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:48,706
we get that right here, great,


669
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:49,236
on the device.


670
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:50,996
Great, so now we've established


671
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:51,966
communication.


672
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,176
Let's go to Attachments and see


673
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,456
how we can use Attachments to


674
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:56,736
communicate with our customers.


675
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,086
I have an image here.


676
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:02,736
We have some internals of what


677
00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:04,376
the home pod might look like.


678
00:23:04,726 --> 00:23:05,836
So yeah, let's send that to the


679
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:06,346
customer.


680
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:07,626
OK, great, I got it on the


681
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:07,826
right.


682
00:23:07,826 --> 00:23:08,796
That's what the inside of the


683
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:09,436
home pod looks like.


684
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:11,976
Great. OK and we can even send


685
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:12,616
images back.


686
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:15,186
I can pull up the camera here


687
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:18,186
and the camera comes up here, I


688
00:23:18,186 --> 00:23:19,806
can take a lovely photo of all


689
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:20,446
you in the audience.


690
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,116
Very good.


691
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,066
And I can send this now back to


692
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:27,046
the business and tell the


693
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:27,876
business, great.


694
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:30,416
Just give it a second to


695
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,216
receive.


696
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:32,466
And here it is.


697
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:33,516
Great. Now I've told the


698
00:23:33,516 --> 00:23:34,776
business all the people looking


699
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:35,696
to communicate with them in the


700
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:35,936
future.


701
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:36,966
That's great [applause].


702
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:44,656
So let's create a scenario that


703
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,836
you might want to go through as


704
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:47,176
a business to try out Business


705
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:47,436
Chat.


706
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:50,956
Let's go on my iOS device and we


707
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:53,716
want to highlight probably


708
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:56,426
something that people experience


709
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,096
pretty often.


710
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:00,696
Let's message this business and


711
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:02,226
say something like, "Let's check


712
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:04,876
the status of my orders."


713
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,466
Now this could be any business,


714
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,546
shipping any kind of order, so


715
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:12,156
we're going to send this to the


716
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,766
business and alright.


717
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:16,306
So now we're going to use the


718
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:19,226
List Picker to send a list of


719
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:20,466
items of the orders that the


720
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:21,586
business knows about to this


721
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:21,966
customer.


722
00:24:23,266 --> 00:24:25,146
Now as Grant mentioned, we have


723
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:26,036
long-lived IDs.


724
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:27,896
So previously I had already


725
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:30,206
authenticated myself, so the


726
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,356
business knows who I am.


727
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:35,046
So they can internally pull up


728
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:36,356
all of the orders that have been


729
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:37,196
assigned to that customer.


730
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,276
So I'm going to -- I have some


731
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,946
saved JSON example here that I'm


732
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,226
going to drag in and you'll see


733
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,286
I filled out the form here.


734
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:45,896
So what do we have?


735
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:47,596
At the top we have the received


736
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:48,106
message.


737
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,276
This is the message that gets


738
00:24:50,276 --> 00:24:51,406
sent by the business and then


739
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,256
received onto the customer's


740
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:54,566
device.


741
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:57,286
You can see you can specify an


742
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:57,846
icon.


743
00:24:58,216 --> 00:24:59,456
There's a title and subtitle of


744
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,566
the bubble and we have different


745
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:02,426
size formats.


746
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:04,186
You can actually modify these to


747
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:05,876
whatever style you'd like.


748
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,706
Down below, we specify the


749
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:08,956
items.


750
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:11,236
So here we have -- You can see I


751
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:12,606
have some items here that I have


752
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:13,026
incoming.


753
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:14,596
I have some T-shirts delivering


754
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,126
today.


755
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:17,496
I have a new iPad Pro coming on


756
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:19,396
June 12th and some Yerba Mate


757
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:20,286
coming, delicious.


758
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,876
We can specify if we want to


759
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:23,986
select multiple items.


760
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,626
So this allows the customer to


761
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:26,886
pick from multiple instead of


762
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:27,636
one at a time.


763
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,106
For this case, let's talk about


764
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:31,626
just one shipment at the start.


765
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,936
And you see I can go ahead and


766
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:36,106
add or remove other items and


767
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:37,726
add or remove other sections as


768
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:38,076
well.


769
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:39,256
But we're just going to start


770
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:40,656
with this one section for this


771
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:41,666
case.


772
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:43,076
Down below I have the Reply


773
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:43,516
Message.


774
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,496
Reply Message is the look of the


775
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:46,916
bubble when I send back the


776
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,296
choice that I've made back to


777
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:48,656
the business.


778
00:25:49,826 --> 00:25:51,636
Here, just like the received


779
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,676
message, I have title and


780
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:55,476
subtitle and I can specify the


781
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:56,186
icon style.


782
00:25:57,486 --> 00:25:59,176
On the right, now, you can see


783
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:01,576
the JSON has been updated to


784
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:04,056
include all of the things I've


785
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:05,106
specified in the form.


786
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:08,846
We have a section for images


787
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:11,536
where we have base64 encoded


788
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,776
images with an identifier.


789
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,376
Below that we have the List


790
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:17,586
Picker section where you specify


791
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:19,186
the sections and the items that


792
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:21,056
I've typed on the left, things


793
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,306
like the T-shirts, title, an


794
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:24,386
image identifier which


795
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:26,046
references the base64 encoded


796
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:29,246
image above, and my other items


797
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:30,256
and some other fields,


798
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,276
specifying order, subtitle, et


799
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:32,836
cetera.


800
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:35,026
Down below, you see we have the


801
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,276
received message and reply


802
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:38,326
message mirroring what I've


803
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:39,466
entered on the left, which


804
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:40,816
specify how the bubbles will


805
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:41,646
look when I send them to my


806
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:42,016
device.


807
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:44,626
Alright, let's give this


808
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:46,626
customer a way to select from


809
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:46,806
these.


810
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:47,646
I'm going to send this to the


811
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:49,976
device and you see on the right


812
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:55,326
of my iPhone up comes bubble for


813
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:56,376
me to select the package.


814
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:59,246
When I tap this bubble, up come


815
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:00,746
the choices that I specified on


816
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:00,966
the left.


817
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:06,156
[ Applause ]


818
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,456
Great. So, let's take a look at


819
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:09,766
these.


820
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:11,466
So I'm really inquiring about


821
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:12,366
this iPad that I'm getting on


822
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:12,896
Monday.


823
00:27:13,276 --> 00:27:15,326
So I'm going to select this and


824
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,846
you see I tap that and up comes


825
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:18,876
the response that I'm ready to


826
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:19,756
send back to the business.


827
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,066
I can go ahead and just send


828
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:22,486
that back.


829
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:24,736
And now in the Business Chat


830
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:26,246
Sandbox, in the transcript


831
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:28,056
you'll see that the List Picker


832
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,746
response has been highlighted so


833
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,236
the business knows which item


834
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:32,866
I'm actually interested in.


835
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:34,716
Alright, great.


836
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:36,306
So, let's continue the


837
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:37,296
experience here.


838
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,106
Let's go from the business and


839
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:42,496
say, "What would you like help


840
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,856
with for this iPad?"


841
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:48,946
So what I really want to do is


842
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:49,946
this iPad is scheduled for


843
00:27:49,946 --> 00:27:52,366
delivery on Monday but I don't


844
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:53,316
really want to wait around for


845
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:53,846
this to come.


846
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:55,646
I want to go and pick this up as


847
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,316
soon as possible, as this is one


848
00:27:58,316 --> 00:27:59,966
of those new iPads.


849
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:02,736
So I'm going to say, "Let's


850
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:05,236
schedule a pickup."


851
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:06,286
So we're assuming now this


852
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,046
business actually has some sort


853
00:28:08,046 --> 00:28:11,016
of pickup location and to do


854
00:28:11,016 --> 00:28:11,976
that we're going schedule a


855
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:12,216
time.


856
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:13,296
So we're going to switch to the


857
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,986
Time Picker so we can schedule a


858
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,176
time for me to go and pick up


859
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:16,796
that iPad.


860
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:19,756
I have some JSON saved down


861
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:20,406
below for that.


862
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:26,896
So I'm going to drag that in


863
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:27,646
[inaudible] and we'll try that


864
00:28:27,646 --> 00:28:27,986
again.


865
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:32,046
OK. So here, we have specified


866
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:33,036
some different images and


867
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:34,796
different icon styles for


868
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,546
received message.


869
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,146
This is just like a List Picker.


870
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:38,106
It has a received message.


871
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,556
This is the bubble that comes in


872
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:41,826
to the customer's device.


873
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:45,146
I've set a title for "Hold iPad


874
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:46,846
for pickup" and a subtle


875
00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:47,546
"Schedule a time."


876
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,196
I also have some details about


877
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,336
this appointment or schedule.


878
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:55,096
I have a name and optionally you


879
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:56,346
can include location details.


880
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:59,426
So in this -- A lot of times,


881
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,976
you know, appointments include


882
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:03,126
an actual location that you're


883
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:03,506
going to.


884
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:04,826
And for that, we can let you


885
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:08,126
specify a name, a lat, long, and


886
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,756
then the user can actually route


887
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:10,756
to that on their device, which


888
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:11,826
I'll show you, momentarily.


889
00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:13,756
Then we can specify time slots,


890
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:17,476
pick from a calendar, the time


891
00:29:17,476 --> 00:29:19,216
of day, and the duration of that


892
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:19,646
appointment.


893
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,496
Down below, I have the reply


894
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,566
message which is used of course


895
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:25,576
to show what happens when you


896
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:26,986
send back the message to the


897
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:27,406
business.


898
00:29:28,436 --> 00:29:30,196
Now on the right, you can see


899
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:33,596
the JSON has been updated to


900
00:29:33,596 --> 00:29:35,596
also include our common images


901
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:37,396
format but below we have the


902
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:40,046
event details and this specifies


903
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,416
things like your time slots.


904
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:44,376
These are all GMT dates and


905
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,766
times with their duration in


906
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:46,196
seconds.


907
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,686
Below that, I have location


908
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:51,096
information specified with the


909
00:29:51,096 --> 00:29:53,956
title, lat, long, and our


910
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:55,236
familiar received and reply


911
00:29:55,236 --> 00:29:55,746
message.


912
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:57,516
So let's schedule this


913
00:29:57,516 --> 00:29:57,946
appointment.


914
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,256
Time is marching on.


915
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,356
Let's send that over to the


916
00:30:02,356 --> 00:30:04,886
device and you see now on the


917
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,806
iPhone here, I have a "Hold iPad


918
00:30:06,956 --> 00:30:07,856
for pickup."


919
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:09,336
I can go ahead and tap this.


920
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:12,186
And you see we're displaying the


921
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,676
options that the user can choose


922
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:14,536
that I've selected.


923
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:16,266
I can show more or show less but


924
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,516
we by default show the top


925
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:18,906
three.


926
00:30:19,866 --> 00:30:22,166
I also -- We're tying in to iOS'


927
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,486
built-in functionality of


928
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:24,906
EventKit, so you can see if


929
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,066
there's any conflicts on your


930
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:27,516
calendar to help you better


931
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:28,976
schedule the time.


932
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:34,456
[ Applause ]


933
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,846
Now I do have an appointment at


934
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:38,656
11:00 but this iPad is way more


935
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:39,316
important than that.


936
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:40,316
So I'm going to take an early


937
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:42,206
lunch and schedule for 11 a.m.


938
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:43,506
I'd like to go and pick up this


939
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:43,716
iPad.


940
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,936
So you see now I have the time


941
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:46,736
selected.


942
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:47,986
I can go ahead and send this


943
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:49,606
back to the Business Chat


944
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:52,556
Sandbox and in the transcript,


945
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,656
in the Sandbox, on the right, we


946
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:55,766
have the time that I've selected


947
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,746
notified to the business.


948
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:00,266
Now, I did mention that we have


949
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,336
this location detail.


950
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:05,086
So on the iPhone, once I've sent


951
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:06,816
this back to the business, I can


952
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:07,866
actually go ahead and tap that


953
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,956
bubble and I get the information


954
00:31:09,956 --> 00:31:11,936
that I've sent back, including


955
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,456
the time and location.


956
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:15,256
From here, I can easily add this


957
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:16,596
appointment right to my calendar


958
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,006
or get directions right in Maps


959
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:18,606
to the location that I've


960
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:18,976
specified.


961
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:24,576
[ Applause ]


962
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:28,136
OK, we're going to close that.


963
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,856
Great. So these are highlighting


964
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:30,486
some of the built-in


965
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:31,606
interactions that you may


966
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,396
encounter when you're


967
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,266
interfacing with Business Chat,


968
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,296
but we also wanted to highlight


969
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:39,366
that you can integrate this with


970
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,406
your own messages apps and take


971
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:42,556
more advantage of the native


972
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:43,516
power of iOS.


973
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:45,056
So let's switch over to the My


974
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:45,636
App tab.


975
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:48,016
And let's talk about this.


976
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:50,936
From here, we have a bunch of


977
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:52,776
fields that you can use to


978
00:31:52,776 --> 00:31:53,866
communicate with your message


979
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:54,036
app.


980
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,716
The top two fields allow you to


981
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:58,216
link to the app, allow your


982
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,256
customer to link to the app in


983
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:00,126
case they don't have it


984
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:00,606
installed.


985
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:03,756
You pull out your iTunes URL ID


986
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,626
and enter that here and you


987
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:06,776
provide your app name, which is


988
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:08,296
shown in the transcript.


989
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:10,706
Then we have the URL field.


990
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,846
So in messages apps, one of the


991
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:14,306
preferred ways to communicate


992
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:15,796
between your messages apps is


993
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:16,976
actually via URL.


994
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:19,376
And you can put URL keys and


995
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:20,876
values here that the app can


996
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:21,306
then read.


997
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:23,376
Down below we have the team


998
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:24,646
identifier and bundle


999
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:25,236
identifier.


1000
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:27,836
These are used so iOS actually


1001
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:29,406
knows which message extension to


1002
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,326
instantiate.


1003
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:32,106
And we have an optional session


1004
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:33,966
identifier used in case you have


1005
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:35,966
multiple message app


1006
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:37,666
transactions going at once, you


1007
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:38,886
can then identify, which one


1008
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:41,546
you're actually talking about.


1009
00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:43,376
Live Message Layouts, as Grant


1010
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:44,526
mentioned, is a new feature in


1011
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:46,856
iOS 11 that lets your message


1012
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:48,566
bubbles draw all the content,


1013
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:49,886
providing way more


1014
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,346
functionality, native


1015
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,946
functionality from iOS, right in


1016
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:54,036
the messages transcript.


1017
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,106
However, if you're sending these


1018
00:32:57,106 --> 00:32:59,726
to older iOS devices, they might


1019
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,196
not support Live Message Layout


1020
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,136
as well as other platforms such


1021
00:33:03,136 --> 00:33:04,106
as the Mac or the Watch.


1022
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:07,136
For that, we allow you to enter


1023
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:08,346
the information that you may


1024
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:10,666
have for the fallback bubble so


1025
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:11,976
at least they can see that


1026
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:13,056
something was received on those


1027
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:13,506
devices.


1028
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:16,436
So I'm going to go ahead and


1029
00:33:16,436 --> 00:33:19,006
drag in some content I have for


1030
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:23,796
the app here.


1031
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:25,596
And OK, so now you see these


1032
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:27,346
fields are filled out and I have


1033
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,426
specified some URL parameters,


1034
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:30,946
which are then read by the


1035
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:32,616
built-in message app on the


1036
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:33,126
device.


1037
00:33:33,536 --> 00:33:35,516
So I have preinstalled already


1038
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:39,266
on this iPhone a message app so


1039
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,316
I don't have to go and show you


1040
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:42,926
how that can download from the


1041
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:43,336
app store.


1042
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:45,516
On the right, you can also see


1043
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,496
the JSON contents is now updated


1044
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,216
with the fields like you've seen


1045
00:33:49,216 --> 00:33:52,016
above, app ID, app name, URL,


1046
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,516
some other information including


1047
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:55,806
the received message fallback


1048
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:56,346
information.


1049
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:59,096
So I'm going to go ahead and


1050
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:00,936
send this but before I do,


1051
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:02,816
remember I've established


1052
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:04,006
communication with this business


1053
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:04,306
already.


1054
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:07,476
So time may have passed and what


1055
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:08,295
this bubble is going to


1056
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:09,616
highlight is I actually have a


1057
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:11,626
shipment that's scheduled for


1058
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:12,326
delivery today.


1059
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:13,886
So I'm going to send that now


1060
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,516
and you'll see that I have these


1061
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:19,376
T-shirts scheduled for delivery


1062
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:20,766
today at WWDC.


1063
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:21,826
Now there's supposed to be --


1064
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,085
There's the map there.


1065
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:24,346
Hold up. I tapped the wrong guy


1066
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:24,545
there.


1067
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:25,646
So here's -- And it's showing me


1068
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:25,976
a map.


1069
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,446
Showing me a map of where those


1070
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,876
are scheduled for delivery.


1071
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:36,476
So this is [applause] -- This is


1072
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:40,996
a -- This is just a notification


1073
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,356
that may have come in randomly


1074
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,326
as you have this Business Chat


1075
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:45,815
environment set up.


1076
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:48,166
But -- And actually, this is


1077
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,726
also using Live Message Layout.


1078
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,306
So you can see I have a map here


1079
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:53,186
and the bubble format has this


1080
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:54,196
green footer.


1081
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:55,505
It doesn't look anything like


1082
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:56,596
the bubbles that you may have


1083
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:57,416
seen in iOS 10.


1084
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,376
That's because this is all


1085
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:00,976
drawing the content natively.


1086
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:03,646
So what you can see is I have


1087
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:04,556
these T-shirts scheduled for


1088
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:06,136
WWDC and they're scheduled for


1089
00:35:06,176 --> 00:35:08,626
delivery today but it looks like


1090
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:09,386
on the map that they're


1091
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:10,826
scheduled for somewhere in San


1092
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:11,346
Francisco.


1093
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:12,326
So that's not right.


1094
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:14,246
Let's tap this bubble and bring


1095
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,756
up our message app.


1096
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,026
And now you can see that I have


1097
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:20,076
incorrectly scheduled these


1098
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,256
T-shirts for Moscone.


1099
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:22,906
But now we're down in San Jose.


1100
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:23,686
So we're going to have to do


1101
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,186
something about that, but before


1102
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:27,576
we do, you can see that this is


1103
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,806
actually this is a live map that


1104
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:31,916
I have here inside Messages.


1105
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:33,316
Everything you can do with


1106
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:34,866
Messages apps, you can do here


1107
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,856
in the Business Chat and this --


1108
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:38,176
And we also have our current


1109
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:39,526
location here in San Jose.


1110
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:41,886
So you're able to tie in to all


1111
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:42,936
of the great powerful features


1112
00:35:42,936 --> 00:35:44,376
of iOS, right in your business


1113
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:44,556
chat.


1114
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,346
This is not a web page.


1115
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:49,416
So now we'd like to reroute


1116
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,386
these to here because this is


1117
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:51,686
the last day of the show and we


1118
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:52,806
really got to get these T-shirts


1119
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:53,006
here.


1120
00:35:53,006 --> 00:35:54,656
So I'm going to tap my current


1121
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:58,026
location and let's specify that


1122
00:35:58,026 --> 00:35:59,366
we want the shipment rerouted to


1123
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,246
my current location.


1124
00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:02,116
There's a $15 charge but I'll


1125
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:02,926
have to expense that.


1126
00:36:02,926 --> 00:36:05,006
We're going to go ahead and


1127
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:06,366
confirm that we want this


1128
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:08,586
rerouted to San Jose Convention


1129
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,496
Center and I'm going to go ahead


1130
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:10,216
and send that back to the


1131
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:10,556
business.


1132
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:11,976
And you'll see in the Business


1133
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:14,356
Chat Sandbox, now we've received


1134
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:16,436
the URL, which specifies the new


1135
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:18,536
location that we've designated


1136
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:19,576
for the shipment.


1137
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:22,546
Great. So that's showing


1138
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,096
integration with your messages


1139
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:25,366
apps.


1140
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,286
But there's one more thing and


1141
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:28,926
that we've scheduled a reroute


1142
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:31,156
and that's going to cost us $15.


1143
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:32,586
So for that we're going to


1144
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:33,786
request a payment from our


1145
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:36,376
customers using Apple Pay.


1146
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:38,486
Now I'm going to drag in our


1147
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:40,826
Apple Pay JSON here and you see


1148
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,456
we have our familiar received


1149
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:45,146
message at the top specifying an


1150
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:47,886
image and title and subtitle of


1151
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:48,896
this bubble.


1152
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:51,556
And down below, we can specify


1153
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,136
our items.


1154
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:53,196
Here, we have a same-day


1155
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,136
shipment reroute that going to


1156
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:56,956
cost you 15 bucks and we have a


1157
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,546
total price as well.


1158
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:00,626
Optionally now, we can also


1159
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:02,006
specify shipping methods.


1160
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,066
For this, this actually is the


1161
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:05,856
reroute.


1162
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,216
So I'm not going to specify


1163
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:08,016
shipping methods.


1164
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,346
We also have fields that you may


1165
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:11,926
be familiar with if you've done


1166
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:13,086
Apple Pay development in the


1167
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:13,546
past.


1168
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,626
We have -- If you'd like to


1169
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:17,546
specify the Apple Pay sheet


1170
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:18,646
should require your billing


1171
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:20,536
address or your shipping address


1172
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:22,386
and what merchant capabilities


1173
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,576
your platform may contain.


1174
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,936
Now these are all standard Apple


1175
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:29,276
Pay functions.


1176
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,036
We didn't do anything custom


1177
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:31,576
here.


1178
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:33,106
So if you're familiar developing


1179
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:34,866
with Apple Pay, this is, these


1180
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:35,586
are things that you've already


1181
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,056
implemented.


1182
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:39,056
We also followed a very common


1183
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:41,306
Apple Pay JS format for the


1184
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:42,236
JSON, which I'll show you over


1185
00:37:42,236 --> 00:37:42,906
here.


1186
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:46,246
So for the JSON for this


1187
00:37:46,246 --> 00:37:49,306
request, we have our received


1188
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:52,486
message and we have our images,


1189
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:54,726
as you've seen before, but now


1190
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:56,776
we have a payment object which


1191
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,136
contains a payment request.


1192
00:37:58,606 --> 00:38:00,296
This contains line items, same


1193
00:38:00,296 --> 00:38:01,946
day shipment reroute for 15


1194
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:04,336
bucks, and a total.


1195
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:06,846
And then we also have our Apple


1196
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:09,216
Pay section, which contains


1197
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:10,896
information for what networks we


1198
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:12,586
support, merchant capabilities,


1199
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,376
and what types of currency we


1200
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:14,746
support.


1201
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:17,276
Now at the bottom, here, you'll


1202
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:19,346
also see we have some other URLs


1203
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:21,296
and this is kind of interesting.


1204
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:22,526
So what we've done is we've


1205
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:24,676
provided a bunch of URLs that


1206
00:38:24,676 --> 00:38:26,026
you can use when you integrate


1207
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:27,186
Apple Pay with your business.


1208
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,066
The first one, payment Gateway


1209
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,026
URL, allows your business to


1210
00:38:31,156 --> 00:38:33,536
send its encrypted payload to


1211
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:34,686
actually process the payment.


1212
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:38,206
Great. We also have three URLs


1213
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,586
that are used when the Apple Pay


1214
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:40,926
sheet is up on the screen.


1215
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:42,426
If you change your payment


1216
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:44,506
method from let's say a debit


1217
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:45,826
card to a credit card, we're


1218
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:48,046
going to hit this URL so you may


1219
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:50,386
want to in some cases maybe


1220
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:51,906
change what offerings you have.


1221
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:53,066
Some businesses may offer


1222
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:54,176
discounts for certain types of


1223
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:54,586
cards.


1224
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:57,206
When you change your shipping


1225
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:59,006
method, we also have a chance to


1226
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,766
hit a server and update your


1227
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:01,476
shipment items.


1228
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:04,316
So let's say we are switching


1229
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,166
from ground to overnight


1230
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,066
delivery, we might have to


1231
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:08,246
update your line items and your


1232
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:08,716
total.


1233
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:10,926
And then your shipping contact,


1234
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,536
if suddenly I want this package


1235
00:39:12,536 --> 00:39:14,676
delivered to Hawaii, you might


1236
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,116
want to update all your shipping


1237
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:17,696
methods, line items, and totals.


1238
00:39:18,396 --> 00:39:19,756
We then have a fallback URL,


1239
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:21,216
which is used in case the


1240
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:22,716
customer doesn't have Apple Pay


1241
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:23,296
on their device.


1242
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:25,596
You can then specify a URL that


1243
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,636
when tapping the Apple Pay


1244
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:28,526
bubble will take you to a web


1245
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:29,836
page of your choice.


1246
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:31,746
And then finally, an order


1247
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:32,526
tracking URL.


1248
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:35,516
This is used once the payment is


1249
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:36,276
complete.


1250
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:37,186
So we've already sent the


1251
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:38,016
payment through the payment


1252
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,846
gateway URL but your business


1253
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:41,966
may have a separate system that


1254
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,056
handles all your orders and


1255
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:44,386
that's what this URL is used


1256
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:44,546
for.


1257
00:39:45,156 --> 00:39:47,916
Great. OK, let's send this to


1258
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:50,156
the device so we can collect


1259
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:51,446
this $15 and gets these


1260
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:51,996
T-shirts.


1261
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,856
So you see on the device now up


1262
00:39:54,856 --> 00:39:56,746
comes our shipment reroute Apple


1263
00:39:56,746 --> 00:39:56,976
Pay Button.


1264
00:39:57,076 --> 00:39:59,876
And I can go ahead and just tap


1265
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,256
this bubble and up pops the


1266
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:02,456
familiar Apple Pay sheet.


1267
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:05,556
From here, all I have to do is


1268
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:06,616
touch ID.


1269
00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:08,526
The payment gets processed, sent


1270
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:10,266
back to the business, and the


1271
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:11,596
bubble is updated with paid, and


1272
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:11,776
that's it.


1273
00:40:12,516 --> 00:40:18,996
[ Applause ]


1274
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:21,776
Alright, so let's go back to
