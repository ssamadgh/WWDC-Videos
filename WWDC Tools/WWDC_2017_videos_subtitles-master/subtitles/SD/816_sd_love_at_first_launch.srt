onboarding.


4
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,086
We're going to discuss how to


5
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:27,906
engage people from the first


6
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,606
moment they open your app and


7
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:31,136
keep them coming back for more.


8
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:33,916
Please welcome, Vince Lane from

00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:45,136
>> Hi, I'm Vince.


12
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,526
There we go.


13
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:51,106
All right, imagine you're


14
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:52,066
searching for an apartment.


15
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:54,106
You've been in the hunt, and


16
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:55,136
this one looks pretty good.


17
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:57,576
The price is right.


18
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:59,216
Photos show tons of natural


19
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:00,376
light, it's close to work.


20
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:02,676
So you schedule some time to


21
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,525
stop by and check the place out.


22
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:06,286
You bike over.


23
00:01:06,426 --> 00:01:07,406
Someone buzzes you in.


24
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:08,566
You find the apartment door.


25
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:10,086
You give it a knock.


26
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:13,316
And the landlord greets you.


27
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,496
And before he'll even let you


28
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:17,436
pass the front door, he has some


29
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:18,166
requirements.


30
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:20,246
He wants to see a passport, a


31
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,966
birth certificate, and your last


32
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:22,916
four paystubs.


33
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:24,146
Now this would be a little


34
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:24,886
ridiculous, right?


35
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,616
You just want to check the place


36
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,766
out, you're not ready to commit


37
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:28,436
to anything yet.


38
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:30,286
Plus, who knows if your private


39
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:32,026
info is safe with this guy.


40
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,596
First impressions matter.


41
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:37,896
They matter because they could


42
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:38,776
also be your last.


43
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:40,846
People have access to millions


44
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:41,896
of apps in the App Store.


45
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:43,846
You've already passed the first


46
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:45,186
hurdle when someone installs


47
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:45,536
your app.


48
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:46,286
Great.


49
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:50,326
So prevent them from backing out


50
00:01:50,326 --> 00:01:51,816
and deleting your app in the


51
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,116
same way you'd probably be off


52
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:54,156
to the next apartment on your


53
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:54,476
list.


54
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,456
And instead, start things off


55
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,756
with a great first impression.


56
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:02,656
Now suppose you're planning a


57
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:03,016
trip.


58
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:04,456
And a friend suggested this


59
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:05,526
travel app here.


60
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:07,596
Looks pretty good.


61
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:09,656
So the installation completes.


62
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,436
You tap open for the first time.


63
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:13,876
And you're met with this.


64
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:16,446
Now, does this look familiar?


65
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,646
Someone wants you to register


66
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:19,916
here, but there's not much info


67
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,516
about what this app actually


68
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:21,926
does.


69
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,486
Sure, you have some idea after


70
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:25,686
your friend's recommendation.


71
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:27,286
But when you open the app for


72
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:29,336
the first time and this is how


73
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:31,166
you're greeted, it still feels a


74
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,126
little something like this guy.


75
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,216
There's a chance you might back


76
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,666
out, delete it, and go find


77
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,246
something else.


78
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:44,306
Now consider this military base


79
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:46,806
with its fortified exterior, the


80
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:48,116
message to anyone on the outside


81
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,626
is clear, stay out, right?


82
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,156
Compare that to Apple Union


83
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,536
Square in San Francisco.


84
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,276
The entire front of the store


85
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,526
opens up to the sidewalk,


86
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,676
inviting passersby to wander in.


87
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:00,856
And wander in is exactly what


88
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:01,276
they do.


89
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,516
As people use -- as people


90
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,906
explore the store, they're able


91
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:06,236
to pick up and use iPhones.


92
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,056
They might take a new Mac for a


93
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,376
test drive or try on an Apple


94
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,636
Watch, all without obstacles or


95
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:12,146
friction.


96
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:14,986
Your first launch experience


97
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,736
should feel just as


98
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:16,376
frictionless.


99
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,116
If people are greeted with an


100
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,316
open, interactive experience the


101
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:21,576
very first time they tap your


102
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,086
icon, you're going to make a


103
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,586
great first impression and keep


104
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:25,156
them coming back.


105
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,046
So let's talk about some ways to


106
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:27,656
make that happen.


107
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,356
We'll be discussing some tips


108
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:32,996
for leading with content first.


109
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,726
How to teach new users about


110
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:37,136
your app through interaction.


111
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,006
And when you need to ask for


112
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:41,246
some more information up front,


113
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:44,526
some tips on timing that will


114
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:45,976
add to a great user experience.


115
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:48,226
So let's start with some


116
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,646
strategies for content first


117
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,086
approach.


118
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:53,646
Let's compare our travel app


119
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,776
here to another travel app.


120
00:03:56,426 --> 00:03:57,716
This is Jetsetter.


121
00:03:58,596 --> 00:03:59,796
The very first time you open


122
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:01,056
Jetsetter, you're immediately


123
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:02,756
greeted with this great content.


124
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,276
Big, beautiful images, useful


125
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:05,966
information.


126
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:07,856
You can browse this feed, of


127
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,026
course, or you can jump right


128
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:09,896
into search if you have


129
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,016
something specific in mind.


130
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:13,446
If a destination catches your


131
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:14,876
attention, you can drill in for


132
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,636
more photos and more details.


133
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,716
And it's been seconds since you


134
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:21,625
first launched this app, and


135
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,656
you're already using it like a


136
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:22,966
pro.


137
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:24,676
You're intrigued by all this


138
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,346
great content and you've already


139
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,546
started daydreaming about laying


140
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:28,306
on this beach.


141
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,206
It's only when you're ready to


142
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:31,946
book the trip that you're


143
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:32,976
prompted to register.


144
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,296
By now, you've got a good idea


145
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:36,586
of what the app has to offer.


146
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:37,786
You've seen the potential


147
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:39,766
benefits of registering, so this


148
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,096
feels like a more appropriate


149
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,476
time to share more details.


150
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,676
If you're not convinced yet,


151
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:49,026
just compare Jetsetter with our


152
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,456
other travel app.


153
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,526
Now, we've all been through some


154
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,726
version of that top row.


155
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:54,966
Which one of these feels more


156
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:55,756
welcoming to you?


157
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,266
Always lead with great content.


158
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,956
Show off what makes your app


159
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,966
great right off the bat, and let


160
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:05,626
people dig in.


161
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:09,616
Now there are some situations


162
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:10,656
where a little bit of upfront


163
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:12,086
instruction might be helpful.


164
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:14,986
And I say might because before


165
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,006
you start incorporating some of


166
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:17,186
the tips we're about to look at,


167
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:18,676
I want you to very carefully


168
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,076
consider whether any upfront


169
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,236
instruction is needed at all.


170
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,486
Let's take a quick look at the


171
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:23,946
phone app.


172
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:27,386
Now, just imagine if we designed


173
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,826
this with a series of first-run


174
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:29,436
tool tips.


175
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:32,356
It'd be a little ridiculous,


176
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:32,576
right?


177
00:05:34,156 --> 00:05:35,456
This interface is obvious.


178
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,866
We know how it works.


179
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,206
You should strive to design your


180
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,686
interfaces to be as intuitive


181
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,176
and as easy to understand as


182
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:42,716
possible.


183
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,016
Ideally, no upfront instruction


184
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:45,716
is needed at all.


185
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:49,206
All right, let's take a look at


186
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,296
Lara Croft GO.


187
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,436
This is your starting point


188
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:52,656
here.


189
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,136
No onboarding, no instructions,


190
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,056
nothing to pull your attention


191
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,646
from this immersive experience.


192
00:05:58,776 --> 00:05:59,716
You're right in the game.


193
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:01,836
But you still need to learn how


194
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:03,196
to play this game, so these


195
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,596
first few levels are designed to


196
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,866
introduce you to the basics.


197
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:08,916
Well, you only have a straight


198
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,766
line here, and Lara looks like


199
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:11,526
she's ready to go.


200
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:13,306
Since there are no visible


201
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,116
controls, you try swiping on the


202
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:15,566
screen.


203
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,956
And sure enough, she starts


204
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:18,966
moving in the direction you've


205
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:19,406
gestured.


206
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:23,696
You quickly discover you can


207
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:24,856
move up and down walls too.


208
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,196
And congratulations, you've


209
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,536
learned the game's navigation


210
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,126
controls.


211
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:32,446
All right, now you've got this


212
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:33,566
glowing tile of a head catching


213
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,166
your attention.


214
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,596
Options look pretty limited, so


215
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:37,976
let's go check it out.


216
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:44,056
Yes, you've just completed a


217
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:44,506
level.


218
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:49,626
Now, that one was pretty simple,


219
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:50,226
of course.


220
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:55,036
But it's teaching you the


221
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,906
basics, and you're already


222
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:57,696
playing the game.


223
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:01,706
All right, level two starts


224
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:01,916
here.


225
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:03,786
Looks like your path is cut


226
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:05,546
short, so let's try that switch.


227
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:13,886
Aha, the missing path fills in,


228
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:15,556
and you figured out another


229
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:16,866
important part about how this


230
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:17,486
game works.


231
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,946
Now, of course, things get a lot


232
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:22,896
more complex from here.


233
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,546
But you can start to see how


234
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,256
instruction can be layered into


235
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:27,086
an experience.


236
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,206
And again, no onboarding, no


237
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,796
tool tips or floating hands


238
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,006
here.


239
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,616
There are no barriers when you


240
00:07:32,616 --> 00:07:33,946
first play Lara Croft GO.


241
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,816
And this approach works in all


242
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:37,216
kinds of apps, not just games.


243
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:40,436
This is streaks.


244
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,136
It's a simple app designed to


245
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,336
help you pick up new habits.


246
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,656
In my case as you might be able


247
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,146
to guess, I'm studying French,


248
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,516
and I'm trying to make a habit


249
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:49,396
of practicing every day.


250
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,786
Maybe Streaks can help.


251
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:53,616
The completion of a task is


252
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,006
represented by the filling in of


253
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:55,386
a ring.


254
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:57,956
So the first launch experience


255
00:07:57,956 --> 00:07:59,656
conveys this in a clever way by


256
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,026
inviting you to fill in rings as


257
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:01,856
you proceed through this


258
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,396
introduction.


259
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,496
And you're led right into


260
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,606
creating your first habit.


261
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:10,146
So if your app requires a bit of


262
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:11,806
upfront education, it's going to


263
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,016
be a lot more compelling if it's


264
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,876
interactive and gives people


265
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,916
that sense of jumping right in.


266
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:20,826
Teach through interactive


267
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:21,666
experiences.


268
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,456
Now, another place you don't


269
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,626
want people to get stuck is with


270
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:27,716
permission requests.


271
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:29,616
You know what it's like to open


272
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:30,756
an app for the first time and


273
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:31,856
get hit with permission requests


274
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,586
after permission requests, sort


275
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:34,775
of like that demanding landlord


276
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:35,426
we met earlier.


277
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,996
So let's look at some tips for


278
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:37,626
getting this right.


279
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,905
This is Strava.


280
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:43,785
Strava lets you use your iPhone


281
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,486
to track outdoor runs and bike


282
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,916
rides, and it eventually asks


283
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,436
for access to your location,


284
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,916
your camera, your contacts, even


285
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:52,566
health get data.


286
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:54,666
But it doesn't ask for all of


287
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,316
these right away.


288
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,776
Instead, Strava makes requests


289
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,126
on an as-needed basis.


290
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,376
For example, it's not until


291
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,446
you're ready to take Strava out


292
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:04,686
for a ride for the first time


293
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:06,136
that you're prompted to share


294
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:06,776
your location.


295
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:09,376
So you hit record down at the


296
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,016
bottom.


297
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,096
We'll get you on a ride here.


298
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:12,846
Who's ready to roll?


299
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:17,676
All right, so you're going on


300
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:18,186
your ride.


301
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,126
And eventually, a little while


302
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,556
later, you're ready to wrap


303
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,246
things up.


304
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:23,236
We'll make it a short ride.


305
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,436
So you stop the ride, and you


306
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:27,086
tap save.


307
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:29,676
Now, when you're saving a ride,


308
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,066
you have the option to add more


309
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,476
details, including a photo.


310
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,446
It's only when you tap add a


311
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:40,126
photo that you're prompted for


312
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:41,556
access to your photo library.


313
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:44,146
And this is another great


314
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,996
example of a permission request


315
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,346
that's right in context.


316
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:48,876
So you immediately see the


317
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:50,396
benefit and no additional


318
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:51,616
explanation is necessary.


319
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,166
And then it's the same situation


320
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,096
when looking for friends on


321
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,576
Strava in your contacts.


322
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:01,316
The app requests permissions on


323
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:02,396
a need-to-know basis.


324
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:04,466
So you retain a sense of control


325
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,296
over both the experience and


326
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:07,096
your private data.


327
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,086
Now, there are a few apps out


328
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:13,696
there that can't offer any value


329
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,606
without some sort of


330
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,206
permissions.


331
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,006
This is Transit.


332
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:18,966
It lists departures of nearby


333
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,876
buses and trains, order based on


334
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:21,916
proximity to your current


335
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,406
location.


336
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,546
I live in San Francisco, and I


337
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:25,976
use this one all the time to get


338
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:26,296
around.


339
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,356
Of course, it wouldn't be able


340
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:30,906
to provide this data without


341
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:32,886
your location, so the first time


342
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:35,046
you launch the app, you are


343
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,436
prompted to share your location.


344
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:39,136
And as soon as you tap allow,


345
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,796
the map zooms in, and you're


346
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,206
presented with a list of nearby


347
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:43,516
routes and departure times.


348
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:45,876
So you immediately see the value


349
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,576
Transit will provide in exchange


350
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:48,596
for this information.


351
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,926
So remember, I'm sure people


352
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:56,656
understand the value of sharing


353
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,726
their private data with you,


354
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:59,866
ideally before you ask for it.


355
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:01,906
Once that permission has been


356
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:04,036
granted, reinforce the decision


357
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:05,406
by showing off the benefits


358
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,916
you'll provide with that data.


359
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:09,116
Only ask for what's needed when


360
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:09,606
it's needed.


361
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:13,636
Follow these tips, and I promise


362
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:14,386
you'll make a great first


363
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:14,856
impression.


364
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:15,636
Thank you.
