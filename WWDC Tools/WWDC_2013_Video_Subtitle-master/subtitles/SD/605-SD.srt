1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:10,176
[ Silence ]


2
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:12,286
>> We have audience
participation.


3
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:14,176
Look at that!


4
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:15,026
That's great.


5
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:16,446
Yehey! [applause]
It's working together.


6
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,376
We have achieved
something here today.


7
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:19,116
All right.


8
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:20,206
What's new in iBooks Author?


9
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:23,946
Great. So today's agenda,
I'm going to give you a demo


10
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:24,686
of iBooks for the Mac.


11
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:25,846
It's going to be a
little bit more in depth


12
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:27,926
than what Craig showed
yesterday during the keynote,


13
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:30,106
although it showed amazing well.


14
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,006
They were very proud of it.


15
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:33,076
I'm going to show
you iBooks Author 2.0


16
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,386
as I promised I would do.


17
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:36,146
And through that you're
going to learn how


18
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:37,366
to do a few different things.


19
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:39,126
You can learn how to
create your own templates,


20
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:41,036
how to build interactive
content.


21
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:42,946
You're going to discover the
new widgets and learn how


22
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:44,076
to apply them effectively.


23
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,656
I'm going to show you how


24
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,676
to publish books directly
within iBooks Author.


25
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:51,446
It's one of the features
we added in version 2.0,


26
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,586
and also show you how to
version your book directly


27
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,716
from within iBooks Author.


28
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:56,776
And then hopefully along
the way, we're going to pick


29
00:00:56,776 --> 00:00:58,746
up some skills that you
wouldn't have come here


30
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:00,796
with that will enable
you to create books


31
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:02,196
in a very efficient manner.


32
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:04,896
First, a recap.


33
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:07,566
So we launched the iBooks
Multi-Touch Experience


34
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:10,446
in January of 2012
with the intent of kind


35
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,746
of revolutionizing textbooks.


36
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:16,676
And our vision was
that through the iPad,


37
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,856
we could create a
new generation of--


38
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:21,056
new version of education
materials that did a lot more


39
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:22,906
than their printed counterparts


40
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,456
by making it a more
multimedia experience,


41
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:29,426
a more explorative experience
that obviously textbooks can be


42
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:31,016
in their static guise.


43
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:35,416
So this is an example of
what our textbooks look like.


44
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,576
You can see they're
very visually rich.


45
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:39,676
You can't tell here of course,


46
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:41,136
but they're very
touch-interactive.


47
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:44,796
These callouts, for example, the
interactive image I can interact


48
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:46,376
with and explore
different facets


49
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:48,746
of that underlying
image very easily.


50
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:52,806
So we've achieved
a few of our goals


51
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,626
that we'd set out to accomplish.


52
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:56,726
So far, we've got thousands


53
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:58,436
of textbooks published
to the iBooks store.


54
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:01,746
We have an excess, I think at
this point, of 22,000 titles


55
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,596
on the bookstore today,
Multi-Touch titles,


56
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,296
which includes publications
from all


57
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,395
of the major textbooks
publishers, Pearson,


58
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,586
McGraw-Hill, Houghton Mifflin,


59
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:14,876
and a bunch of independent
publishers, you may be some


60
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,076
of them, thousands
of those worldwide.


61
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:20,366
We've got 100 percent coverage
of the high school core,


62
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,986
common core curriculum
in the United States.


63
00:02:22,986 --> 00:02:25,046
We have over 2,500 classrooms


64
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:27,926
in the US using these
Multi-Touch textbooks today.


65
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:31,886
And now we have books
available in the US, in Canada,


66
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:33,726
Australia, and the UK.


67
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,396
So really proud of our
achievements there.


68
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:38,646
And here're some examples
of the kinds of textbooks


69
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:39,756
that are being published today.


70
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:42,476
Shakespeare like you've
never known it before,


71
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,576
the Shakespearience.


72
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:45,556
Just give round of applause


73
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:46,996
for the Shakespeariemce
folks right now.


74
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,306
By making judicious use of media
and interacted experiences,


75
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,386
it allows you to kind of explore
and experience Shakespeare


76
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:55,316
in a way you never,
ever could before.


77
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,866
The Houghton Mifflin's biology,


78
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,466
Richard Feynman's
Six Easy Pieces,


79
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:04,046
it's-that's a bald face lie
of a title, but whatever.


80
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:07,976
Core-- Core Class Life
Science, our course E.


81
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:08,116
O.


82
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:10,076
Wilson's Life on
Earth, I could go on.


83
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:12,176
But in addition to those
educational titles,


84
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:15,606
we're seeing books in many
other categories find their way


85
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:16,476
to the iBooks store.


86
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:19,016
Publishers have found this
platform and are using it


87
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:22,206
to showcase titles that are from
different categories altogether.


88
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:25,996
So from Random House, we have
Tyler Florence's Fresh book,


89
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:29,286
which through interactive
content allows you


90
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,906
to explore these recipes
in kind of a different way.


91
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,136
They've even got smart things
like an HTML widget at the end


92
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:38,466
of the book that allows you
to calculate the ingredients


93
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,466
that you're going to need
given the number of servings


94
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,256
that you need to serve.


95
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:45,506
Jessica Alba's lifestyle
book, The Honest Life,


96
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:47,346
a book she managed to published


97
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:50,606
on her own despite my
repeated attempt to help her.


98
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:56,026
The Rolling Stones, 50-year--
50 years of the Rolling Stones,


99
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:59,556
it's an amazing multimedia
book, a great back scenes,


100
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,976
behind the scenes kind of
view point of the band.


101
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,206
Linda McCartney's photographic,
just published by Taschen,


102
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,476
very happy to see
that get published.


103
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:11,786
DK, one of our most prolific
publishers with amazing animals,


104
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,676
I think they've got-- well,
over 40 titles now around.


105
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:16,646
I might be lying about that.


106
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:19,016
Don't quote me, but
just a lot of titles.


107
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,196
Amongst those other
titles, we have books


108
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,036
that are somewhat technical in
nature which may be the kinds


109
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:26,846
of things that maybe
you're hoping to do


110
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:30,006
out there spans the
gamut from, like,


111
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:33,586
gaming guides to user guides.


112
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,876
Here we have a Canon
Mark 5D user guide.


113
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,956
I see a couple of titles
here that are going


114
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:43,936
to need updating just
based on revelations


115
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,946
from this very conference,
that guy notably.


116
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,556
But you get the picture.


117
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,706
If you've got something
to say and the materials


118
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:54,686
to say it with, you can
put a book together.


119
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:56,186
You can publish to
the iBookstore


120
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,206
and get the message out.


121
00:04:57,716 --> 00:05:03,266
And now, you're not just getting
the message out on the iPad,


122
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,286
you're also getting
it out via the Mac.


123
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,276
So without further adieu, I'm
going to give you a little demo


124
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,706
of iBooks for the Mac.


125
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:12,876
All right, so this is my
new Mavericks desktop.


126
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:16,886
I'm going to click the shiny new
iBooks icon, up pops my Library.


127
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,576
Here all the books in my Library


128
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,886
which I can browse a
number of different ways.


129
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:24,506
It's going to point out the
buttons on the toolbar here


130
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:27,426
so everyone is familiarized
with the UI.


131
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:28,686
This is the Store button.


132
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:31,356
I dare not press it
today for this demo


133
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:34,296
but when you do click
it, we're shipping--


134
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,146
you'll flip over
to the iBooks store


135
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:38,286
and you'll get the
complete iBooks experience


136
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:39,696
and if you shop in context,


137
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,246
the same way you do
within iTunes today.


138
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:44,586
Next we have a set of tabs
that allows me to kind of look


139
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:45,976
at my books in a different way.


140
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,496
So I can click on
the collections tab,


141
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:51,066
see all my purchased books,
see just my textbooks,


142
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:52,836
see my fiction books, and so on.


143
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:56,396
I can view by author, I can
view by genre or I can view


144
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:59,096
in a list view which
hasn't built out yet.


145
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:01,196
Obviously the books
are all searchable.


146
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,836
I can sort them in
different ways,


147
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,326
can sort them alphabetically
which will make more sense


148
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,556
when I turn on the labels.


149
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:13,226
You have a number of different
options for viewing your books.


150
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:16,506
So let's get into one
of our book experiences.


151
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,206
The first one I'm going
to show you is Curiosity.


152
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:20,546
And this book kind


153
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,926
of exemplifies why we
built iBooks Author.


154
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,166
Because the gentleman
who published this book--


155
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:30,566
his name is Patrick Lister
is not a book publisher.


156
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,376
[Background Music] He's
not a book designer.


157
00:06:32,436 --> 00:06:33,866
His background is
in engineering,


158
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:39,156
but he has a fondness and love
for the Mars Exploration Program


159
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:43,436
and thought he could
showcase it in a book


160
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,166
which he's absolutely done.


161
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:48,356
And he's created a
beautiful experience.


162
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:52,336
So there you saw the intermedia
which you may recognize


163
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,976
or remember from the iPad.


164
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:57,296
When it plays through, I'm
brought to the graphical table


165
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,956
of contents view, it's
exactly the same as the iPad


166
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:03,726
and it's a good place to call
out evidence that you built


167
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:07,036
for one platform and you get
the benefit of having it run


168
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:08,246
on multiple platforms.


169
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:09,016
So it's going to
work on the iPad.


170
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:09,886
It's going to work here.


171
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,026
You don't have to
do anything special.


172
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,476
Also the methods of
interacting with the content


173
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,696
on the iPad have transferred.


174
00:07:16,696 --> 00:07:20,316
So here I'm using my Macbook Pro
and I've got a trackpad with it.


175
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,406
So if I want to swipe
through my chapters,


176
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:24,316
I can just swipe
using my fingers


177
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,716
on the trackpad and away I go.


178
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:28,976
I can also swipe through
the thumbnails down here


179
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:32,216
at the bottom, decide where I
want to go and just click there.


180
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:33,736
Let's start with page 1.


181
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:38,266
So here, I swiped to page 2.


182
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:39,466
There's a movie.


183
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:40,946
[Background Music] I can
play that movie in place.


184
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:45,896
[ Music ]


185
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,916
I can also expand that movie--


186
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,336
>> It was this really
amazing moment--


187
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,226
>> So it fills the
window if I want to make


188
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,986
that window larger, I can.


189
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:54,866
That's great.


190
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,016
You'll note here that we've
actually overtaken the


191
00:07:58,016 --> 00:07:58,766
toolbar here.


192
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,436
So it's an edge to
edge experience--


193
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,016
to full bleed experience
for media.


194
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:04,226
We want it to maximize
the impact


195
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,496
of that media on the page.


196
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:10,606
When I'm done, I just click
Done and I'm back to the page.


197
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:13,806
An example of some beautiful
typographic treatment


198
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:15,776
that Patrick has
integrated within his book,


199
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:17,016
we're going to replicate
that later


200
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:20,686
on so I'm drawing your attention
to it, kind of right now.


201
00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:21,876
Next, we have gallery.


202
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,026
You can swipe through the
images of the gallery in place.


203
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:27,776
I can click on individual
thumbs.


204
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:30,216
I can go full-screen.


205
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:31,936
I can do all of that stuff


206
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,626
and you can see the
experiences very complete.


207
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,566
If I pause for a
second, the UI fades away


208
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:39,515
and then you can really feel
that completeness of the image.


209
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,476
Scanning over on our
pages a little bit.


210
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:52,026
Here we've got a 3D
element, interact with Mars,


211
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,946
spin it around, which
I love to do


212
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,346
and of course here it's
identifying all the landing


213
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:58,046
points for the various
rovers and landers


214
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,256
that have spotted
Mars over the years.


215
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:04,046
Next, I want to show
you an example


216
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,156
of something that's
found on another page.


217
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:09,246
To get back to the graphical
table of contents view


218
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,086
with the trackpad,
I simply pinch,


219
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:12,476
same convention as the iPad.


220
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:16,116
And now I can scan ahead
to the next chapter,


221
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:18,466
click on the contents
of the next chapter,


222
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,756
and find a page that
I've bookmarked.


223
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,076
Here it is.


224
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:26,186
So whenever you bookmarked a
page in iBooks for the Mac,


225
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:28,626
you see a red bookmark
represented on your thumbnail.


226
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:32,616
So I want to show you this guy
'cause this is an HTML widget


227
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:36,886
that is really effectively
used and it's a good example


228
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:41,136
of when you should choose
to use HTML to have kind


229
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,416
of a unique experience.


230
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,586
So here, it's a timeline
of Mars exploration.


231
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,806
So I can actually scroll
down here with the trackpad,


232
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,846
click on an event
in the timeline


233
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:54,256
or I can use these
little previous,


234
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:56,156
next navigators to
get to a place.


235
00:09:56,156 --> 00:10:00,316
It's really quite beautiful
and impactful and no reason--


236
00:10:01,406 --> 00:10:02,626
well, they have every reason,


237
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:04,686
Patrick had every reason not
use a conventional widget


238
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:07,626
but rather do something
in it's own in this case.


239
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,916
And I hit Escape and I'm out.


240
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:11,636
So this page is bookmarked.


241
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,936
If I rollover the
toolbar area up here.


242
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,596
You'll see that we have
a few different icons


243
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:17,456
that appear within the toolbar.


244
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:18,896
I can see this page
is bookmarked.


245
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,246
If I click the arrow
just to the right of it,


246
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,966
I see that I've got some
other things earmarked.


247
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:26,036
I'm going to choose one--


248
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,596
actually I'm not going
to choose one right now.


249
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:31,786
Let me show you the
pop-over widget first.


250
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:35,126
So, here you can't really
tell but this is more


251
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,536
than just a static image.


252
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,386
Patrick used the pop-over widget


253
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,066
to provide some additional
information about the


254
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,226
where the world's
radio broadcast here.


255
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:48,596
So, the sidebar widget and the
pop-over widget are widgets


256
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:50,316
that are great for kind
of condensing the amount


257
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,836
of information that
you get on a page.


258
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,836
So if you have a side story
that you need to tell,


259
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,076
you can tell it really
well using these widgets.


260
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,826
I want to show that
everything is clickable.


261
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,066
You can click on an image,
it's brought full-screen.


262
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,856
You can examine it
in full glory.


263
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,156
Every image that we save


264
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:08,036
out in iBooks Author is
taking iPad Retina Displays


265
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:11,696
into accounts which means you
have overhead for users to kind


266
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:13,086
of zoom in and explore images,


267
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:14,956
and really get the
most from them.


268
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:20,326
All right.


269
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:21,716
So next I'm going
to switch gears


270
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:23,236
and show you another title.


271
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:24,166
No, I'm not going
to do that either.


272
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,606
I'm going to search
for something.


273
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,606
So Johannes Kepler,
who had a lot to say


274
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,216
about planetary motion.


275
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:33,866
In here, I mentioned a sidebar.


276
00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:36,426
This is where I want
to show the sidebar.


277
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:38,866
So the sidebar here is
a scrolling sidebar,


278
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,926
looks and feels a lot like the
pop-over widget I just showed,


279
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:45,106
except that always occupies a
place on the page, but again,


280
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:48,236
a very great way to kind
of collapse information


281
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:50,426
within any given page.


282
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:53,886
And now I really will switch
to go show you another title.


283
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:56,296
So I click this little
Toolbar icon at the left,


284
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:58,396
it represents the Library
up comes the Library.


285
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,916
I'm going to close this guy.


286
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,916
Now I'm going to show Richard
Feynman's Six Easy Pieces,


287
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:06,426
like I told you very much a lie.


288
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:12,426
>> [Background Music] Things on
a very small scale behave-- -


289
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:12,886
>> All right.


290
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:13,956
So [inaudible] for
me the experience,


291
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,506
apparently Richard Feynman
was as fond of bongos


292
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,256
as he was theoretical physics.


293
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:23,466
Who knew? It's the
same deal once you get


294
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,936
into the chapter view, of
course, from scrolling ahead,


295
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,996
there's something I want
to show here in Chapter 2,


296
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,496
and I know I bookmarked
that page.


297
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:35,676
What I'm going to show you
now is two different guises


298
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,116
of this audio widget, which
is in fact, the media widget.


299
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:42,246
So here we see the
standard playback control


300
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:44,016
that you may remember
from version 1


301
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:45,826
of iBooks Multi-Touch Books.


302
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:50,176
So this is great for long form
audio if you have something


303
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:53,496
that users may need to
scrub through or want to zap


304
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:55,056
to a specific point within.


305
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:58,876
The scrubber is a great way to
kind of support that activity.


306
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:02,586
But that's not appropriate
for all audio links.


307
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,826
Here, we have another
version of the audio widget.


308
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,976
It's in the button the mode.


309
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:08,116
And when I click it--


310
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:11,366
>> So we gradually try to
analyze all this trying


311
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,786
to put together things which
at first sight look different


312
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,536
with the hope that we maybe
able to reduce the thing


313
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,216
and understand it better.


314
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,146
>> Obviously, you
didn't hear any of that.


315
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,986
But you saw the radio playback.


316
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:25,086
You saw that it was
giving you feedback


317
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,416
about the length of the content.


318
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,356
And that content was the right--


319
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:32,646
or this button interaction
was the right way


320
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,816
to represent audio
of that duration.


321
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,596
But what I really
want to show you


322
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:41,616
in this title are our
note taking features to--


323
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:46,206
so I'm going to launch our
pop-over table of contents view.


324
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,426
So this is another kind
of table of contents view.


325
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,276
You saw the graphical
table contents view.


326
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:54,036
This represents all of the
contents of your book as a list


327
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,786
and it's analogous
to the portrait table


328
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:57,106
of contents from the iPad.


329
00:13:57,886 --> 00:14:02,856
So I can expand in chapter
and click on a location


330
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:05,316
and I'm brought to that
page within the book.


331
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:07,446
And you'll note that
down here, what appeared


332
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,666
in this little placard is
basically a kind of snapback UI


333
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,246
or history UI that would
allow me to get back


334
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:14,436
to my previous location.


335
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,166
So if I'm following a hyperlink,
or exploring something


336
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:18,386
in kind of a free form way.


337
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:21,146
I can get back to previous
location very quickly.


338
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:23,546
But here as I mentioned,


339
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:25,576
I want to show you our
highlights and notes.


340
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,896
So I have a highlight
and a corresponding note.


341
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:30,396
If I want to view the contents
of that note, I can click on it


342
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:32,006
and that note will
appear in place.


343
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:38,896
If I want to create a highlight
and a note, I can simply draw


344
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,896
out a selection range and then


345
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:43,546
up will pop this little
highlighting menu, and then via


346
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,626
that menu I can just
hit Add Note.


347
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:53,986
And there I've added my note.


348
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:55,886
There's another method
for creating a highlight


349
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,146
in very quick fashion, too.


350
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,476
That's using the
command key as modifier.


351
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,456
It was a shortcut rather.


352
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:04,066
And with it, I can just
simply draw out my highlight,


353
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:07,906
click on it again, change the
color, and you get the idea.


354
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,856
Now whenever you
resize the window,


355
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,856
we're trying do a
couple of smart things.


356
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:17,846
So you'll note that, when the
window is fit to the page size


357
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:19,286
and it kind of roll
over the margins,


358
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,576
these little page affordances,


359
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:23,526
paging affordances
appear in the page margin.


360
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,146
If I make the window
just a little bit larger,


361
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,626
you'll see that they actually
appear on the outside,


362
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,496
it will allow me to page.


363
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,686
If I make the window
larger still,


364
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:34,996
you can see that the notes are
telegraphing that they're going


365
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:36,176
to appear in the margin for me.


366
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,876
So if ever I need to
review my notes in context,


367
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:40,826
this is a great and efficient
way to be able to do that.


368
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:43,856
Then I can simply page through


369
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:48,146
and view all these
notes in line.


370
00:15:49,226 --> 00:15:51,406
But wait, there's more.


371
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:54,616
If I make the window
larger still,


372
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:56,486
you can see that there's a
little page trying to peek


373
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:57,236
out in the background.


374
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,576
When the window gets big enough,


375
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,756
I get Two Up mode
which is awesome.


376
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:05,976
And then, of course, if you want
it all, you can have Two Up,


377
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:10,206
notes in margins and you're good
to go, making really great use


378
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:12,046
of the Mac's overall resolution


379
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,286
and the ability to
resize windows.


380
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:15,766
We also have a notes view.


381
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:18,666
So up here in the toolbar,
you click on the second icon


382
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,546
from left and it will come the
notes view or the notes panel.


383
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:23,326
And within it, I have--


384
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:24,886
or can see all of the notes


385
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,666
across all the chapters
in the book.


386
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,556
Only those chapters that
have notes are represented


387
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:29,096
in this view.


388
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:34,136
But if I want to quickly find a
note, I can scan to a location,


389
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,956
click this button, and,
of course, that page,


390
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:39,666
and I click this button, of
course, it's only one page away.


391
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:43,136
I will click this button
and boom, I just warped


392
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,226
to another part of the book.


393
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:49,156
All together, if I want to edit
a note in place, I can do this.


394
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,156
And I'm good to go.


395
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,386
And then, if I want to get
back to the previous location,


396
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,346
where we were before, I
click on that and there I am.


397
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:07,185
Finally, when it comes
time to review my notes


398
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:11,096
and to study the contents
preparing for a test,


399
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,346
we brought over the study cards


400
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:13,766
that you may remember
from the iPad.


401
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,056
So here's a set of study
cards that are derived


402
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:17,796
from my highlights and my notes.


403
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:19,266
There are no glossary
terms defined


404
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,076
for this particular book.


405
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,526
But if they were, they
would appear here in line


406
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:24,096
with my own notes
and highlights.


407
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:28,566
But in order to move through
the cards, I can simply swipe


408
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:31,426
with the track pad,
click to flip the card.


409
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,306
I've heard it said a number of
times, but I wish I had this


410
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:44,496
if when I was in school
about 20 years ago.


411
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,096
You can also filter these down,
so it's just your glossary terms


412
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:51,006
or highlights of any given
color, a very powerful tool


413
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:53,816
for studying and we think this
is going to be a great boon


414
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:57,906
for students who used their
Mac in studying contexts.


415
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:05,456
So that's it for our tour
of iBooks for the Mac


416
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:07,156
and to switch back to my slides.


417
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:13,496
So all of that content was
enabled with this tool,


418
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:18,376
iBooks Author, textbooks, cook
books, photography anthologies,


419
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:21,436
anything that is visual
in nature is fair game


420
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:23,406
for iBooks Author and
anything that could be extended


421
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,206
with media is also fair
game for iBooks Author.


422
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:28,976
So what is it?


423
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,706
Well, it's a tool for creating
exactly that kind of content,


424
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:35,056
it's a WYSIWYG in dragg-and-drop
editor, we try and stayed--


425
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:36,666
we stayed very true
to those kind


426
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,166
of interaction principles
throughout the system


427
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,656
and all the workflows
it supports.


428
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:44,106
So with those paradigms in mind,


429
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,766
you can write edit
and import text.


430
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:49,376
You can add graphics, you
can customize page layouts,


431
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:51,416
you can make the thing look and
feel exactly as you need it.


432
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:55,266
You can also create these
interactive experiences using


433
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,806
basic media like
images, video, and audio,


434
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,356
just using basic drag
and drop techniques.


435
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:02,826
It works for single publishers.


436
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,966
It also works for professional
publishing pipelines


437
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,926
where you have many
users collaborating


438
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,786
around a single book.


439
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:11,656
And probably, the
biggest incentive this,


440
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:12,726
of course, it's free.


441
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:15,486
We're not asking you to
shell out lots of cash.


442
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:18,016
We are however asking you to
publish to the iBooks store.


443
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:19,506
So please do that.


444
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:23,056
Why would you choose to use
this particular platform


445
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,816
over other competitive
choices that you may have


446
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:26,946
and that are open to you?


447
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:31,146
Well, you can create these
immersive iPad experiences


448
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:33,316
without code and
these are experiences


449
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:34,446
that are designed for the iPad.


450
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:37,826
So all of that work and
thought and experience


451
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:41,306
in designing the iPad itself is
being translated directly here.


452
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,476
So when we design a widget, you
can be assured that you're going


453
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,206
to get a very equality
experience at the end


454
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:48,276
when the users actually
interact with your content.


455
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:52,356
But we provide flexibility
for you to go out on your own


456
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,756
and create these great
unique experiences


457
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:56,896
like the timeline I showed
you from Patrick Lister's book


458
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:00,456
when you need to, just
using HTML widget and HTML5.


459
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,976
As I mentioned, it's designed
to work perfectly on the iPad.


460
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,516
But now, of course,
the Mac create--


461
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,686
wants published in
many places or have it


462
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:11,176
to be consumed to many places.


463
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,136
You get true layout and type
setting, so things looked


464
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:16,796
like real books but they
feel like something else.


465
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:19,446
They feel like something
it's truly interactive.


466
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,676
And the sum-- total of which
leads to this statement,


467
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:24,546
which is bold, but
it is my opinion.


468
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:26,116
It's the best platform


469
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:28,276
for creating interactive
media rich books,


470
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:29,266
that's out there today.


471
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:30,506
You can't do it with ePub.


472
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,316
You can't do it with PDF.


473
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,276
Of course, not in the way that
you can with iBooks Author


474
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,486
in the .ibooks format.


475
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:42,146
So what's new in
iBooks Author 2.0?


476
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:45,326
What kind of stuff
you're going to see today?


477
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,246
We introduced portrait-fixed
layout books.


478
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:51,146
Our first version of the books
where in a landscape flavor,


479
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:53,726
there was a portrait
flow mode that was kind


480
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:56,596
of an optional mode that was
enabled by turning the iPad


481
00:20:56,596 --> 00:20:58,366
into a portrait orientation.


482
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:01,286
But now, portrait-fixed layout
books, you can layout something


483
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:02,796
that fills a lot
more like a book.


484
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,736
We have introduced two math
typesettings using LaTeX


485
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:06,646
and MathML.


486
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:09,996
We are optimizing
media automatically.


487
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:13,026
So when you drag in a piece
of media, you don't have


488
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:15,256
to precompress it, we're
going to do that for you.


489
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:17,036
We're also going to transcode
it to the right format.


490
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:19,186
So you don't run in any
glitches when you're uploading


491
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:21,786
to the iBooks store and your
content will get refused


492
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:22,276
as a result.


493
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:25,766
We've got new widgets, I
showed you the pop-over widget,


494
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:27,376
I showed you the
scrolling sidebar widget,


495
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,196
and the new audio widget modes.


496
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:33,356
The enhanced publishing workflow
with the support for versioning


497
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,786
which is very important when
you want to update your book.


498
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:39,226
Basically, we're trying
to transform people's--


499
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,536
I don't want to say it--


500
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:44,306
understanding of books and
make them feel more evergreen


501
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:44,846
in nature.


502
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:48,316
So like apps can be updated on
an ongoing basis and content


503
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:51,386
and new value can continue to be
added to your-- for your users.


504
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,756
You can do that now
with iBooks books.


505
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:57,556
And we also now support embedded
font, so you really can get


506
00:21:57,556 --> 00:22:00,526
that crisp, custom look
that you're looking for.


507
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,976
All right.


508
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:07,206
So now on to part 2.


509
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:09,936
Let me show you how to
build this great stuff using


510
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:10,976
iBooks Author.


511
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,746
Now there are few points I
want to leave you with today.


512
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:19,966
Probably, the most important
of them is this, when you sit


513
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:22,086
down to write your book
or compose your book


514
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:24,686
within iBooks Author, you
really should have written your


515
00:22:24,686 --> 00:22:25,346
book first.


516
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:28,556
You can sit down and
start typing away


517
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:30,796
and you can craft your book.


518
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:33,826
And you'll get there and
you'll be able to do it


519
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:38,846
with little difficulty, but it
won't put you on the great place


520
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:40,126
to make changes down the line.


521
00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:43,216
So what we recommend to do
is that you do two things.


522
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:45,276
You write your book
first, your write it


523
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:47,846
with your interactive content in
mind to know what you want to do


524
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,436
when you sit down to compose
with in iBooks Author.


525
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,956
And then finally,
we ask that you--


526
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:56,596
or recommend rather that you
build your template first.


527
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:58,586
Building your template will
allow you to make those kinds


528
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,146
of changes late in the editorial
process when you need to.


529
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:06,316
It will help support multiuser
or collaboration workflows


530
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:08,256
when you're working with
many people, you know,


531
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,316
just make your life a
lot easier, trust me.


532
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,566
So our content here that
I'm choosing to replicate is


533
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,906
that Curiosity book
that we'd shown.


534
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,566
So in order to replicate
it, I'm going to try


535
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,796
and find a template here


536
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:25,236
that roughly approximates
Patrick's look and feel,


537
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:26,826
nothing is identical to it.


538
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,546
So up here, we have a collection


539
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:31,686
of landscape templates
which I can choose.


540
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:33,666
Down here, we have the
portrait fix layout templates


541
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,596
which we introduced
with version 2.0.


542
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,306
It's a landscape book
that we're going to create


543
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:44,006
and this is the template we're
going to chose to create it.


544
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:48,346
So when you launch a template
we're putting you in a place


545
00:23:48,346 --> 00:23:50,806
where if you want to start
creating your book, you can kind


546
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,846
of just get under way and
start building things.


547
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:57,866
We're not going to do that
right here now that we're going


548
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,616
to build our template
first as I recommended.


549
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:02,846
But first, let's take a look
at the UI of iBooks Author.


550
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:07,896
So if any of you are users of
Pages, Keynote, or Numbers,


551
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:09,956
do we have those users out
there, are they out there,


552
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:11,726
and so we'd like to see.


553
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:14,326
This is going to
feel familiar, right.


554
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:16,936
It's the same framework that
you recognize from those tools.


555
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:18,686
Not only as the UI
framework the same,


556
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:20,006
the underlying objects
are the same.


557
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:22,836
So when you create a table
in Numbers and you paste it


558
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,406
in here, you're getting that
table, we don't support things


559
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,776
like computation
within those tables,


560
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:28,786
but the table will come over.


561
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:31,106
If you create graph,
any graphic elements,


562
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:34,276
in any of those applications,
you can copy and paste them here


563
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:35,406
and stuff, is just
going to work.


564
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:37,756
So going left to right
across our toolbar,


565
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,776
if you want to add
content to your book,


566
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:41,266
you do it by the
Add Pages button.


567
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:45,666
And as I'm rolling over
these different objects,


568
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,486
I'm seeing a bunch of layouts


569
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,676
that correspond with
these objects.


570
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:52,036
These objects are also
describing the structure


571
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:52,906
of an iBooks book.


572
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,926
At the highest level of the
book, there is the chapter,


573
00:24:56,986 --> 00:24:58,816
beneath the chapter,
there's the section,


574
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:00,786
a section contains pages.


575
00:25:00,826 --> 00:25:04,056
So here's the chapter,
it's top to your item,


576
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,006
second to your section,
and then finally,


577
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:09,446
discreet page layouts
which I can apply.


578
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:12,386
Be delving into that
further in just a little bit.


579
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,476
Next up, the View switch,
used this to turn on


580
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:20,696
or off different user interface
elements within iBooks Author.


581
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,956
So for example, if I
wanted to change my sidebar


582
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:27,036
to an outline view, instead of
thumbnails, I could do that.


583
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:31,876
I could turn on or off the
Format bar, but I'm going


584
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,676
to turn that on because
that's actually going


585
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:35,596
to help us edit more quickly.


586
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,896
The Orientation switch
which allows me to switch


587
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:42,226
between the portrait flow mode
that is used only on the iPad,


588
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:45,526
it's not used on iBooks
for Mac in landscape.


589
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:47,246
We won't go into that today.


590
00:25:47,726 --> 00:25:49,536
I'm not going to touch
on anything having to do


591
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:51,216
with portrait flow
mode here today.


592
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,926
But if-- should you
want to learn more,


593
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:55,796
I recommend going back to
last year's session where I go


594
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:58,806
into great detail about how to
work with portrait flow mode,


595
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:01,566
that's available online
in the developer website.


596
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:04,066
Next up, we have a
graphic create tools,


597
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,156
I need text, I add a text box.


598
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:07,776
If I want to add
a graphic shape,


599
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:11,106
I can have a graphic shape,
create a table, add a chart,


600
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,206
you can add any of the numbers,


601
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,356
any of the widgets
that we shift with.


602
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:18,036
Here they are all nine of them.


603
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:18,866
I can preview.


604
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,596
I'll show you how to
preview a little bit later


605
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,456
and I can also publish,
we'll be going


606
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,146
through the publish
workflow in a little bit.


607
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:26,216
Finally, there's the Inspector.


608
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:27,696
Well not finally.


609
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:32,666
We also have the system edit
panels, font color and media.


610
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:33,976
We won't use those.


611
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:35,846
But the Inspector
is very important.


612
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,266
The Inspector is the thing that
used to edit the attributes


613
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,496
of any object that you
select within the canvas.


614
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:43,256
So when you're composing
things right here


615
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,706
and you're editing things and
you're moving stuff around,


616
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:49,506
this is where you edit the
attributes of the said things.


617
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:54,746
So it's good to get
to know the Inspector.


618
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:59,416
Now to round out our tour,
over here we have the sidebar,


619
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:01,756
it's got some special
nodes contained within it,


620
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:04,016
the top most node is our cover.


621
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:05,886
This is where we can
compose and build our cover


622
00:27:05,886 --> 00:27:07,776
that will get shift out when
we go to publish our book.


623
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:10,026
And we have a spot
for Intro Media,


624
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:13,666
so that splashy video intro that
you saw for both of the books.


625
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,796
This is where you would add it,
just by dragging in a movie.


626
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:19,266
We have the table of contents
authoring environments,


627
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:21,236
so you can build out your
table of contents here


628
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:22,686
and create a custom
look and feel for it.


629
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:25,466
And then finally, we
have the glossary.


630
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:28,196
All right.


631
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:30,336
So let's get start--
started building.


632
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:34,976
I'm going to open another
document just for reference.


633
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:45,726
So just to remind myself,
what Patrick's book looked


634
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:50,906
like I'm going to call this
up from a time to time.


635
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,446
Now I should make
that a lot smaller.


636
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:57,166
All right.


637
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:00,006
So this is an example
of this very same page.


638
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,956
It's similar and that is
got a very full-bleed image,


639
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:06,096
but the title is
completely different.


640
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:08,186
It's got this background
element here.


641
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,216
We don't want any of that.


642
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,466
So let's go edit
it away right now.


643
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:18,136
So the first thing I'm going
to do, just because, you now,


644
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:20,346
it's my book, I want to see
what it feels like a little bit.


645
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,206
I'm going to drag in my
image from my chapter


646
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:23,506
and that kind of feels good.


647
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:26,636
I'm going to edit the
title, OK, the long--


648
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:37,136
Great. So it sort of feels like
my book, but not close enough.


649
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:40,086
In order to make it really look
like the book, I'm going to have


650
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:43,376
to change the layout that
this page references.


651
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:46,346
So to view my layouts, you
can do one of two ways.


652
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,736
You can go to the view menu
where I told you, you can turn


653
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:52,206
on or off different UI
elements and go show layouts.


654
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:54,146
Or you can simply
split this bar down.


655
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:56,886
It's just living behind
your page thumbnails.


656
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,556
And this little check
mark indicates


657
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:02,206
that this is the layout
that's being utilized


658
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,346
for this very page right now.


659
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:07,216
But there are two pages
associated with chapter


660
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:09,076
and section layouts and
I'll explain what they are.


661
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:11,696
The first page is
always the splash page.


662
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:12,586
It's the visual thing


663
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:15,536
that identifies an incoming
chapter or a section.


664
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:19,016
And then, the second page
is a body page which is used


665
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:22,126
to create all of the text
pages within that chapter


666
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:23,506
or section as the case may be.


667
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:27,456
So when you import text and
random pages are created


668
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:30,226
for you automatically, that's
the page that's being reference.


669
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,876
Well, here's a layout that
looks a little bit more


670
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,106
like the one we want.


671
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:39,096
I'm going to actually
apply it right now.


672
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:40,336
Looks a little bit better.


673
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:43,026
It's still not the
thing that we need.


674
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,846
So I'm going to edit
the contents


675
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:47,596
of the layout right now.


676
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:51,326
So in the Inspector,
I'm going to switch


677
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:52,146
over to the Layout tab.


678
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:53,406
And within the Layout tab,


679
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:56,106
I find the attributes
for layout objects.


680
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:58,806
Layout objects are anything
that lives inside your layout.


681
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:02,096
When I select this background
image it tells me a few


682
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:03,696
different things about
what it set up to do.


683
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:07,096
So this first check
box enables the--


684
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:09,286
well, me as the book creator


685
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:13,486
to basically edit this
content on the page.


686
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:17,526
If didn't check this box
and I apply these changes,


687
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:21,226
I would be unable to edit
or modify or even select


688
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:24,106
that thing anymore on the page.


689
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:26,146
So I'm just going
to undo that change.


690
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:31,816
It has a special tag.


691
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,666
This main image tag is what
we used to identify images


692
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,306
that will also be used in
the table of contents view.


693
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:41,516
So follow me just for a second.


694
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:43,196
If I switch over to the
table of contents view,


695
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,066
you can see that two
things have happened.


696
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:47,146
The background image
that we have supplied


697
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:51,746
for the chapter was used here
and the title that we entered


698
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,436
onto the chapter head
page is also being used


699
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,606
in the table of contents view.


700
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:02,336
So you might be asking yourself,
how do iBooks Author know


701
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:04,186
to make that the
title for the chapter?


702
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:06,146
It knew to make that the
title for the chapter


703
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:09,986
because it was using something
called a section title smart


704
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:12,466
field which this thing is.


705
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:15,956
It has a telltale visual
cue which is kind of hard


706
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:18,756
to see here in this display
or in this composition.


707
00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:20,716
But basically, it's
a blue outline


708
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:21,886
that surrounds that word.


709
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:26,816
And what this field is used to
do is basically name the thing


710
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:28,336
that it's currently applied to.


711
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:31,006
So what we're telling
the smart field to do is


712
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:32,976
to name every chapter
it's applied to,


713
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:35,616
it either reflects the name
if you put it in somewhere


714
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:39,246
or it allows you to edit
the name directly in place.


715
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:41,546
So when I went and
edited the name here,


716
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,596
that's how it got all the way


717
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:45,306
over to the table
of contents view.


718
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:48,556
And if something goes
wacky in your setup,


719
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,596
and you should accidentally
delete this thing


720
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,836
and delete the other
thing, don't freak out.


721
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:57,346
You can very easily
create another one by going


722
00:31:57,346 --> 00:32:00,546
to the insert panel and
selecting section title


723
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,266
and you're often
running yet again.


724
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:07,386
What we need to do here,


725
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,436
I'm going to preserve those
elements is restyle these


726
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:12,376
things, so it looks a little
bit more like Patrick's design.


727
00:32:12,496 --> 00:32:14,106
He used the Avenir font,


728
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:16,416
it's going to very quickly
select the Avenir font.


729
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:22,316
And he used basically one
lockup for the chapter


730
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:24,176
and the chapter numbers.


731
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,096
I'm going to delete
the second thing here.


732
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:30,096
And then, I'm going to
insert another smart field


733
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:32,096
which we called the section--
numbering smart field.


734
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:34,936
The section numbering smart
field is a dynamic thing,


735
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:39,276
but you don't edit things in
it, it just reflects the title


736
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,226
or the name of the thing
and the number of the thing


737
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,396
that it is applied to.


738
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:45,566
So if I insert section
number here,


739
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,416
it comes up by default telling
me, "Hey, I'm Chapter 1."


740
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:50,616
But I just want it
to be a number.


741
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:52,106
So I say, hey, give
me the number only.


742
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:58,896
And then I believe Patrick
had this as an orange element,


743
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:03,806
I know full well, he
did, blind you guys.


744
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:06,656
I've applied the changes
and that we have something


745
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:09,616
that looks a lot more like
what Patrick had in his book.


746
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:13,796
So we've just finished
editing our chapter head page.


747
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:19,446
Now the body page has a
couple of different things.


748
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:20,646
You can't really
see it right now.


749
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:23,946
Down here, we've got
a page number element


750
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:25,876
and up here we've got
the body text container


751
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:26,656
which you can't see.


752
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:30,776
Now Patrick's pages
featured a black background,


753
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:34,736
I'm going to create one here by
simply adding a graphic form.


754
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,226
You can't see what
I'm doing here.


755
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:47,066
I'm using a hotkey to push
this object into the back.


756
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:52,086
Now I'm going to just
make the body text white.


757
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:54,946
So we can see it.


758
00:33:56,946 --> 00:34:00,446
And now we have edited
the wrong thing.


759
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:01,336
That's OK.


760
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:07,746
Did anyone see me
making that mistake,


761
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:09,656
hands up if you saw me
making that mistake.


762
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,726
That's good eyes,
good, thank you.


763
00:34:12,396 --> 00:34:14,246
Call it out next time though
'cause I get really farther.


764
00:34:16,746 --> 00:34:22,326
Let's copy and paste that
stuff, add text container


765
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,466
because that guy
won't come over.


766
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,326
All right.


767
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:33,286
Now we're back on track.


768
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:44,386
OK. So we now fully edited--


769
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,186
sorry, don't get
confused by that again.


770
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:48,076
I was going to delete him so I
can't make the mistake again.


771
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:51,196
We've now fully edited
that body page.


772
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:53,766
So if the chapter needs to
create pages, it can do so.


773
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:56,376
And they're going to look
exactly like we need them.


774
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,636
Next up, we're going to
create the section page.


775
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:02,666
And one of the benefits of
working with the templates


776
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,546
that we've provided
as the iBooks group is


777
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:08,376
that we have done all of the
thinking around, you know,


778
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,386
what's the best point
size for the iPad,


779
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:11,956
what are the best page
layouts for the iPad


780
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,566
that give the right
proportions of white space


781
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:15,946
to the actual text content.


782
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:18,306
So it's in your best
interest that kind of work


783
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:20,246
with the layouts that we
provide and customize them


784
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,996
in exactly the way that
I'm showing right now.


785
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:26,936
We do this because we don't want
you putting unnecessary effort


786
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:29,296
if you are a real book
designer and you want


787
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,006
to completely custom, you
can go ahead and do that.


788
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:32,866
But for the rest of us,


789
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:34,676
it's nice to have
these starting places.


790
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:37,956
And that's the setup for
me saying, "Hey, don't go


791
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:39,946
and rebuild a section
from scratch the way


792
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:41,376
that we just did the chapter."


793
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:44,216
If you want to create
a new section,


794
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:46,586
you can just duplicate the
thing we've already created


795
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:50,596
which has most of the stuff
that we need and drag it


796
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:52,296
over to the section layouts area


797
00:35:52,586 --> 00:35:54,186
and now we have a
new section layout.


798
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:57,436
We don't need this thing.


799
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:00,336
We will need this thing.


800
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:04,186
And we're going to need another
one of these black things.


801
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:10,556
And there you go.


802
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:12,616
Now the only problem with this
is, it's currently setup is


803
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:16,926
that that chapter-- that section
numbering field that we set up,


804
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:19,296
is currently pointing at
the chapter we want it


805
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:20,786
to actually point at a section.


806
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:24,116
So we can double-click to
edit it, specify section


807
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:25,976
and we're pretty much
good to go at this point.


808
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:36,716
Now, I'm going to remind us
again what Patrick has done


809
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:37,856
in other areas of the book.


810
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,946
I think, I can actually
tour that guy down.


811
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:45,526
He has these large
quotation-- sorry--


812
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:48,296
he has these quotations that are
rendered in large or in text,


813
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,726
orange text, do you
remember that when I showed


814
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,856
that in the original
run through.


815
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:54,896
I'm going to go very
quickly create that text box


816
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:57,986
to contain that quote.


817
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:09,416
But I chose a ginormous
point size.


818
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,326
That's pretty ginormous.


819
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,116
Maybe not that ginormous,
a little smaller.


820
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:14,946
There you go.


821
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,466
To make sure that
we can edit it later


822
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:17,946
when we're actually
composing the pages,


823
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,096
I mark it as editable.


824
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:21,146
And I'm going to
give a custom tag.


825
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:24,266
Now the benefit of using tag
is that when it comes time


826
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:26,316
to switch out layouts, if
you got multiple layouts


827
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:27,986
that can all be applied
in similar content.


828
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:31,256
If you tag things the same
way throughout the layouts,


829
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,726
they'll actually inherit the
contents between the layouts


830
00:37:33,726 --> 00:37:35,546
which is kind of nice.


831
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:40,096
And then finally, there's the
attribution which I'm not going


832
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:44,766
to bother adding right now
'cause I want get underway


833
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:45,646
building our book.


834
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:47,106
But we're basically done.


835
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:50,056
We've created two layouts now
that through which we're going


836
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:54,676
to be able to compose
the rest of our chapter.


837
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:58,496
So now I can go to
our add pages menu,


838
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:02,396
add our new section layout.


839
00:38:02,396 --> 00:38:04,066
Actually, I'm not
going to do that.


840
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:07,026
Do something even better.


841
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:12,116
I'm going to bring in the Pages
document that contains all


842
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:14,636
of my text for this chapter and
just drag it into the sidebar.


843
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:19,016
When I do, iBooks Author
prompts me to choose a layout


844
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:22,266
and in this way it tells iBooks
Author what level this content


845
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:22,896
is going to live at.


846
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:24,476
We want this to be a section.


847
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:25,906
It's a little bit different
from Patrick's book.


848
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:28,486
He only had chapters, but
I want to show a little bit


849
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:29,976
of the book structure
and hierarchy here.


850
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:33,406
Note also this check box.


851
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:36,346
If you have crafted--
and many people do this,


852
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,936
painstakingly so, if you
crafted paragraphs styles


853
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:40,976
in your document that you
want to preserve, you're going


854
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:42,206
to want to check this box.


855
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,416
And when you do that, all


856
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,916
of the incoming paragraph
styles will merge


857
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:48,086
with the paragraph
styles from the template


858
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:50,606
and you'll have them, but we're
also smart enough to recognize


859
00:38:51,926 --> 00:38:53,356
when they've been
named the same.


860
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:55,646
So you won't have
duplicate paragraph styles.


861
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:58,606
We'll just keep the
ones that are incoming.


862
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:04,376
So there you have it.


863
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:06,126
We've created a run of pages all


864
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:07,906
from the layouts
that we just created.


865
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:09,946
I'm not sure how long it took
us to create those layouts,


866
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:13,996
but something in the
order of 10 to 15 minutes.


867
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:16,986
And you would also want to
create some custom page layouts


868
00:39:16,986 --> 00:39:18,316
which you could apply
to your book throughout.


869
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,076
That's going to take
some additional time.


870
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:24,406
But suffice to say, you can do
this kind of thing very quickly.


871
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:32,756
So I'd embedded the quotations
that we need here over there.


872
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:38,286
Copy that text and just
paste it, I should have done


873
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:39,766
that attribution
as another element.


874
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:41,746
Forget that.


875
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,876
We're going to name
this section.


876
00:39:51,616 --> 00:39:53,306
So great, it's named
on the page.


877
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:57,206
But as I mentioned, because
we're using those naming smart


878
00:39:57,206 --> 00:40:00,506
field, I'm actually identifying
the components of my book.


879
00:40:00,506 --> 00:40:03,026
So now if we switch back to
our table of contents view,


880
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:06,036
we can see that we have
three sections created


881
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,876
within our chapter, the first
of which I've actually named.


882
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,646
Did I actually do that?


883
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:14,406
No, I didn't.


884
00:40:14,906 --> 00:40:20,806
I fell into a trap of my--
literally my own design,


885
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:22,216
literally my own designs.


886
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:25,436
It's-- I'm not proud
of this fact.


887
00:40:25,646 --> 00:40:29,586
OK. So if you should see that
that blue line has gone away,


888
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:30,956
it's evidence that you've wiped


889
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:33,266
out that section
naming smart field


890
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:34,666
and you need to recreate it.


891
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:41,016
So I've just undone
that mistake.


892
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:43,316
And now we see that the thing
is kind of correctly named


893
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:46,076
and I also undo that resize
there, but there you go.


894
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:50,936
Now while we're looking at
the table of contents view,


895
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:53,586
this is the area where you can
obviously customize the table


896
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:55,226
of contents experience.


897
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:58,066
The only caveat being that
what you do for one chapter,


898
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,226
you do for all chapters.


899
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:01,596
So if I'm going to
delete this background


900
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:04,346
and then restyle my text and
do whatever I needed to do,


901
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,666
it has to work for all of
the chapters of my book


902
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,956
because it's going to
be shared amongst them


903
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:12,726
when the user is swiping
through in the graphical table


904
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:13,416
of contents.


905
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:19,406
The next thing that
you're going to want to do


906
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:22,936
to define the structure of
your book is through something


907
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:24,856
that we call semantic
paragraph styles.


908
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:29,116
So books have subjects
or headings contained


909
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:30,436
within things like chapters.


910
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:33,986
And you want to identify these
things to iBooks Author so that


911
00:41:33,986 --> 00:41:36,376
when the user searches
for them in the book.


912
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:38,116
We can bring them
to the right place,


913
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:40,186
the places that matter--
that matter most.


914
00:41:40,816 --> 00:41:44,536
There are three components
to any templates.


915
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:47,316
There're the layouts that
are contained with in it.


916
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,626
There are the object styles
that are preserved within it.


917
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:52,986
And then there are the
paragraph styles that it owns.


918
00:41:53,026 --> 00:41:55,736
If you want to view the
paragraph styles for template,


919
00:41:55,786 --> 00:41:57,816
you can do one of two ways.


920
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,936
You can click to view the
paragraph styles drawer


921
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,486
and here you can
see them all here.


922
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,306
Also your character styles and
list styles are preserved there.


923
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,946
So I'm going to apply the
heading one, paragraph style


924
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,606
to this text and
it's been adopted.


925
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:14,326
The font is incorrect,
so I'm going


926
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:18,276
to change it, Avenirs
I did before.


927
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:25,536
Make that a little bit smaller.


928
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:28,756
And now what we'll see--


929
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,986
see this little red arrow in
the paragraph styles drawer,


930
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:33,246
this indicates that
the paragraph style


931
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:34,806
that that text think it--


932
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,236
thinks it is, is different


933
00:42:37,236 --> 00:42:38,876
than what the text
actually is right now.


934
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,666
We've overwritten
that paragraph style.


935
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:43,166
If we want everything to
have this new paragraph style


936
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:48,776
that we just defined, we can
select this via that menu,


937
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:51,136
redefine style from selection.


938
00:42:51,576 --> 00:42:55,936
Now every time we come across
a heading that we want to apply


939
00:42:55,936 --> 00:43:03,046
that style to we've got the
new style and that's great.


940
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:03,646
All right.


941
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:07,356
So how about the
interactive stuff,


942
00:43:07,356 --> 00:43:08,896
we've got some content
over here.


943
00:43:08,896 --> 00:43:11,246
I'm going to close my
paragraph style drawer first,


944
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:13,206
bring in some new content.


945
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:16,406
The first and most basic


946
00:43:16,436 --> 00:43:20,016
of the interactive elements is
the simple and humble image.


947
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:22,816
And insert a page
break here quickly,


948
00:43:22,816 --> 00:43:26,196
so we're just looking
at that image.


949
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:29,316
This image, we know
it's special,


950
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:30,856
iBooks Author doesn't
know it's special.


951
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:32,236
The way that you
make this special


952
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:35,266
so that people can actually
interact with it is you go


953
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:36,986
over here to the Widget
tab in the Inspector.


954
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:40,416
And within this Widget tab,
you'll find the attributes


955
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:41,536
of interactive things.


956
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:45,466
So there are two ways to make
this thing actually interactive,


957
00:43:45,466 --> 00:43:48,506
you can add a title
to it or a caption


958
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:52,076
and that's evidence enough
that you think this is special.


959
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:55,126
So when a user taps on it, it's
going to go full-screen for them


960
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:57,016
or go to the expanded state.


961
00:43:57,496 --> 00:44:00,626
You can also just check this box


962
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:02,746
which is make zoomable
in iBooks.


963
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:07,906
So if you didn't have a title or
caption, you can check this box.


964
00:44:07,956 --> 00:44:10,786
And then, when a user clicks
or taps on that thing,


965
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:14,126
they'll be able to see it in
kind of an expanded state.


966
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:20,416
But I'm going to leave the
title and caption there.


967
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:25,146
Next up, I'm going
to show you another


968
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:27,236
of the version 2.0 features


969
00:44:27,236 --> 00:44:30,976
which is our support
for LaTeX and MathML.


970
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:36,246
So in order to do that, I'm
going to place my cursor here,


971
00:44:37,356 --> 00:44:40,806
you access the equation
input user experience


972
00:44:41,156 --> 00:44:43,366
through the Insert panel,
I'm going to insert equation


973
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:46,776
and up will pop our
Equation Editor.


974
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:49,546
And I hope to God, I can
remember this equation.


975
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:53,326
So for circular pads,


976
00:44:53,506 --> 00:45:01,656
the equation is something
like 2 [inaudible] 3.


977
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:04,526
There you go.


978
00:45:04,526 --> 00:45:06,086
You can see this preview area


979
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:08,676
that I've successfully
entered an equation.


980
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:11,706
My mother would be
very proud of me.


981
00:45:11,806 --> 00:45:13,236
If you edit it in such a way


982
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:14,956
that the equation
becomes invalid--


983
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,486
we just redo what I've done--


984
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:21,346
like put the hat without
completing that statement.


985
00:45:22,026 --> 00:45:24,006
You can see it, it shows
as an invalid equation.


986
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:25,616
But once it's done,
I can insert it.


987
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:28,426
This is proper text.


988
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:29,366
I can edit it.


989
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:32,376
I can give it a new size.


990
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:36,256
I can send or justify it.


991
00:45:37,616 --> 00:45:40,296
So real math type setting
now within iBooks Author,


992
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:41,486
also works for MathML.


993
00:45:41,926 --> 00:45:43,476
Trust me. I'm not going to
show you that right now.


994
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:47,746
Next up, I want to show you
the scrolling sidebar widget.


995
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,356
I mentioned that's a
great way to do something


996
00:45:49,356 --> 00:45:52,126
like tell a historical
aside like I'm going


997
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:53,456
to do for Johannes Kepler.


998
00:45:53,976 --> 00:46:00,386
So this is very simple, just
drag in some text, boom;


999
00:46:01,046 --> 00:46:05,396
drag in an image, double boom.


1000
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:08,576
He's not a very happy looking
man, but he was brilliant.


1001
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:12,006
You can also style this.


1002
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,006
It's a graphic object like
any other graphic object


1003
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:14,956
within iBooks Author.


1004
00:46:14,956 --> 00:46:17,816
So if I want to give this
a black background fill


1005
00:46:18,216 --> 00:46:25,946
and make my text white like the
rest of my content, I can do so.


1006
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,576
So there you have it.


1007
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,416
There's the scrolling
sidebar widget.


1008
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:32,826
Now finally, I'm going to add
one more page which I think,


1009
00:46:33,406 --> 00:46:40,366
just going to add a blank page
here and add a final widget.


1010
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:42,656
It's going to be the timeline
widget that we saw before.


1011
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:52,676
Now the timeline widget is a
full-screen-only experience


1012
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:56,866
which means that you have to
tap on the element that's shown


1013
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:59,976
on the page before you can
interact with the HTML.


1014
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:03,046
You can, however,
preview HTML most


1015
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:04,426
of the time within
iBooks Author.


1016
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:05,456
I can't do with this widget.


1017
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:08,666
But if you hit Edit HTML,
you're brought to an environment


1018
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,546
where you can actually
preview the HTML.


1019
00:47:10,546 --> 00:47:12,436
It's not going to work, as I
mentioned, for this widget.


1020
00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:15,156
You click Done when you're done.


1021
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:18,206
But there's our HTML
widget in place.


1022
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:24,246
Now that's our first section
of three sections built out.


1023
00:47:24,246 --> 00:47:26,146
I can go-- click back to
the table of contents.


1024
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:28,106
Say yes, everything is
going according to plan.


1025
00:47:29,436 --> 00:47:35,036
I'm going to paste in our quote.


1026
00:47:35,816 --> 00:47:39,436
I expect you're following
along now.


1027
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:41,636
So I'm going to move
a lot more quickly.


1028
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:46,816
Choose that heading style that
we applied or that we created.


1029
00:47:47,426 --> 00:47:51,506
Oh, did I actually
ever prove to you


1030
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:53,596
that we were doing something
special with that heading style?


1031
00:47:54,096 --> 00:47:54,236
>> Yes.


1032
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:56,726
>> Did I? OK.


1033
00:47:57,226 --> 00:48:00,786
Did I switch over to
the sidebar to do that?


1034
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:01,536
[Inaudible Response]


1035
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:02,166
>> Thank you.


1036
00:48:02,406 --> 00:48:04,236
So let's switch to
the outline view.


1037
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,486
You can see here,
that's the evidence


1038
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:09,006
that those semantic paragraph
styles are doing their job.


1039
00:48:09,006 --> 00:48:12,026
So when I go to that
table of contents view,


1040
00:48:12,026 --> 00:48:15,196
the pop-over table of contents
view in iBooks, I'm going to see


1041
00:48:15,196 --> 00:48:16,996
that stuff listed there
and that's the way


1042
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:19,046
that it gets there using that
semantic paragraph style.


1043
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:22,366
Thank you, phantom
voice from the audience.


1044
00:48:22,876 --> 00:48:25,016
>> You're welcome.


1045
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:25,676
[Laughter]


1046
00:48:25,676 --> 00:48:27,806
>> All right.


1047
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:29,836
So let's add some more
interactive stuff.


1048
00:48:29,836 --> 00:48:30,526
We're pressed for times.


1049
00:48:30,526 --> 00:48:32,106
So I'm going to do this quickly.


1050
00:48:32,706 --> 00:48:34,886
Next up, we'll set a movie,
it's very easy to do, right?


1051
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:36,596
If you got a movie,
slam it in there.


1052
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:40,676
The attributes for
the movie are limited.


1053
00:48:40,676 --> 00:48:43,456
I can click over to
the Widget tab and see


1054
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:44,896
that I have the option
to show these things.


1055
00:48:44,896 --> 00:48:48,556
The thumbnail-only which means
it would be just stay proxy


1056
00:48:48,556 --> 00:48:49,986
on the page, and
I'll click that proxy


1057
00:48:49,986 --> 00:48:51,646
and the movie will only
play in full-screen.


1058
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,346
But we want it to play in place.


1059
00:48:53,906 --> 00:48:56,466
I can also choose the
poster frame that I want.


1060
00:48:56,606 --> 00:49:00,606
That's exciting enough for me.


1061
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:03,346
I can choose looping
options for it.


1062
00:49:03,346 --> 00:49:04,306
I don't want the movie to loop.


1063
00:49:04,306 --> 00:49:07,036
It's a rather lengthy
movie, why would it loop.


1064
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:10,106
But there I'm done with it.


1065
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:14,646
Next up, I'm just going to
insert another page break


1066
00:49:14,646 --> 00:49:16,506
to this content appears
over there.


1067
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:19,616
And I'll show you how to
configure an audio widget.


1068
00:49:23,516 --> 00:49:28,546
So here we have a little
audio snippet from, I believe,


1069
00:49:28,876 --> 00:49:32,486
the mission control commander
for the Viking missions.


1070
00:49:33,786 --> 00:49:37,326
He's very excited about
observing the first image


1071
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:39,856
from Mars ever which this is.


1072
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:42,346
Actually, it's pretty amazing.


1073
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:47,136
>> How do you possibly
describe the first photograph


1074
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:49,856
that a human being has ever seen


1075
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:52,026
from the surface
of another planet?


1076
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:55,436
>> I would say it's kind
of contrasty and maybe,


1077
00:49:55,836 --> 00:49:57,846
framing's not great,
but whatever.


1078
00:49:57,846 --> 00:49:59,976
I mean, you know, at least
proud of, you should be.


1079
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:04,216
So that the way that you
define what the audio is going


1080
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:06,646
to represent itself as
on the page is, again,


1081
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:09,606
in the Widget tab, I can choose
to make that scrubber if I want,


1082
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,546
but it's better left a button.


1083
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:14,066
I can also make it an image.


1084
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:17,986
If I wanted this whole
surface to be a tappable thing


1085
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:20,326
that would play that audio
clip as Patrick has it,


1086
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:23,986
I could just say,
make it an image


1087
00:50:24,136 --> 00:50:25,256
and then delete that image.


1088
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:33,306
And now we have a clickable
thing that will play


1089
00:50:33,306 --> 00:50:37,666
that audio clip when the user--
well, I'll deal with that--


1090
00:50:39,186 --> 00:50:40,856
selects it on the page.


1091
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:44,266
So not a beautiful layout there
but you kind of get the idea


1092
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:46,506
and also that I'm trying to
move very quickly through this.


1093
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:51,276
Galleries-- Galleries are fun.


1094
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:53,006
They're probably
one of the best ways


1095
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:55,446
to make your content more
interactive as evidence


1096
00:50:55,446 --> 00:50:57,376
by the Feynman book which
is basically just a bunch


1097
00:50:57,376 --> 00:50:58,676
of audio clips and images.


1098
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:01,426
You know, that's all it takes


1099
00:51:01,556 --> 00:51:03,216
to make the experience
truly engaging.


1100
00:51:03,216 --> 00:51:06,926
And in case of the Feynman book,
Caltech just had all the stuff


1101
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:09,466
in the archives resurrected
and give it kind of new life


1102
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,936
by combining it with, you know,


1103
00:51:10,936 --> 00:51:14,686
Feynman's magnum opus
of Six Easy Pieces.


1104
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:19,226
And it's pretty amazing what
it does, just through the use


1105
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:20,796
of simple and basic media type.


1106
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:24,826
For the gallery, you can
go to the pedantic route


1107
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:26,616
of adding the gallery and
dragging the images in


1108
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,786
or you're just drag
in the folder and,


1109
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:29,986
boom, you've got gallery.


1110
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:33,386
It was a folder of
images if you had a folder


1111
00:51:33,956 --> 00:51:36,386
of Word documents you
wouldn't have been happy.


1112
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:39,916
But you can see as I'm
resizing that gallery


1113
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:42,256
and making it fill the page,


1114
00:51:42,256 --> 00:51:44,716
that the imagery is
doing the right thing.


1115
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:47,916
So we're always kind of
maximizing the content


1116
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:50,176
within the available space
within that canvass space.


1117
00:51:50,176 --> 00:51:53,846
If I need to reorient or
reposition something on a kind


1118
00:51:53,846 --> 00:51:55,386
of a per image basis, I can.


1119
00:51:55,766 --> 00:51:57,356
But I'm pretty happy
with the way that looks.


1120
00:51:58,136 --> 00:52:01,206
So I'm going to leave it there.


1121
00:52:01,656 --> 00:52:07,586
3D content, we support 3D that
is rendered out using a kind


1122
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,716
of standard file
format known as Collada,


1123
00:52:10,096 --> 00:52:11,566
it's an interchange format.


1124
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:12,566
It doesn't do a lot.


1125
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,996
But it does allow all of your--


1126
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:20,226
all of the conventional 3D
authoring tools to export models


1127
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:22,646
that you can use here
in iBooks Author.


1128
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:26,726
This one doesn't have
a great background


1129
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,296
for it, let's start white.


1130
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:30,906
It's not going to work for
us, I'm going to quickly make


1131
00:52:30,906 --> 00:52:34,856
that black and it's good.


1132
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:38,376
One thing I have to
show you before we wrap


1133
00:52:38,376 --> 00:52:39,486
up this interactive image.


1134
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:41,396
So let me just create one here.


1135
00:52:41,656 --> 00:52:43,976
I'm not going to go to the
other section to do that.


1136
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,866
Now, the interactive
image is one


1137
00:52:50,866 --> 00:52:52,416
of our most favorite widgets.


1138
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:57,876
It's the one that allows you
to kind of create these very--


1139
00:53:00,016 --> 00:53:03,296
it's a very engaging
experience just around photos.


1140
00:53:03,826 --> 00:53:07,366
And what you do is
you set up callouts


1141
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:09,266
to identify features
within the photos.


1142
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:12,066
So I've just inserted
the interactive image.


1143
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,816
I'm going to drag over an image.


1144
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:20,436
There it is, all of the lunar
exploration rovers are there.


1145
00:53:20,436 --> 00:53:22,416
The little one kind of looks


1146
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,326
like the Tech Droid
from Star Wars.


1147
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,336
Am I allowed to say that?


1148
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:28,466
I'm probably not
allowed to say that.


1149
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:30,226
I said it.


1150
00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:35,346
In order to define a
kind of special region


1151
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:37,606
within this image, I
can select the callout.


1152
00:53:38,546 --> 00:53:40,646
This is already got kind
of a zoom set up for it.


1153
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:44,076
But I'm going to bring
this callout down here.


1154
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:54,996
At least [inaudible], kind
of zoom in a little bit.


1155
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:57,516
And now we've set a
view for the Sojourner.


1156
00:53:57,886 --> 00:54:04,986
So we can go from our
default view to that view.


1157
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:12,016
So we've got a nice
interpolation.


1158
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:14,186
In the interest of time,
however, I'm not going to set


1159
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:15,586
up all of these callouts.


1160
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,596
Let's just do two.


1161
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,446
Zooming a little bit, set
the view, and now we're done.


1162
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:33,976
We've set up our
interactive image.


1163
00:54:35,216 --> 00:54:40,426
So two things very
quickly, pop-over widget.


1164
00:54:41,186 --> 00:54:42,936
The pop-over widget is
a great way to supply


1165
00:54:42,936 --> 00:54:45,336
that secondary information
when you want the user to kind


1166
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:47,886
of guess what the contents
maybe or be surprised


1167
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:49,546
when the contents are revealed.


1168
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,036
To create it, I insert one.


1169
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:57,006
I drag over an image
that I want to use.


1170
00:54:57,006 --> 00:55:03,156
Actually, I don't want
that one, I want Sojourner.


1171
00:55:03,226 --> 00:55:05,256
I drag over the image that
I want to serve as kind


1172
00:55:05,256 --> 00:55:07,666
of the tap target, the thing
that the users going to interact


1173
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,606
with to pop the pop-over.


1174
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,556
I can double-click it.


1175
00:55:11,636 --> 00:55:12,556
There's my pop-over.


1176
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,586
To populate it, I mean,
just drag in text,


1177
00:55:17,056 --> 00:55:22,966
drag another image element,
position it where I want it.


1178
00:55:25,076 --> 00:55:29,696
Sort of kind of-- sort
of kind of-- there we go.


1179
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:31,496
Boy, it's really twitchy.


1180
00:55:31,576 --> 00:55:31,926
There you go.


1181
00:55:32,636 --> 00:55:33,606
And there we have it.


1182
00:55:34,326 --> 00:55:38,776
And then finally I'm going to
add a Keynote which I was hoping


1183
00:55:38,776 --> 00:55:40,976
to be able to show you how
to build yourself right now,


1184
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:42,266
but we won't be able to do that.


1185
00:55:43,026 --> 00:55:45,296
After a moment of
processing that file,


1186
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:50,486
keynote is actually being
prompted in the background


1187
00:55:50,486 --> 00:55:52,946
to create a lightweight
version of the presentation.


1188
00:55:53,446 --> 00:55:56,816
In order to make this look a
little bit better on the page,


1189
00:55:56,816 --> 00:55:59,706
I'm going to use another great
feature for reducing content,


1190
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:01,546
a footprint on your pages


1191
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:04,556
and that is Show
Widget As Thumbnail.


1192
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:07,206
And when you click Show
Widget As Thumbnail,


1193
00:56:07,206 --> 00:56:10,056
that experience will be
represented by a proxy element


1194
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:10,846
that you're going to tap


1195
00:56:10,846 --> 00:56:13,396
on before the user
goes to full-screen.


1196
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:18,856
And I'm going to customize that
tap element just by dragging


1197
00:56:20,116 --> 00:56:22,736
in an image that I want
to service my proxy


1198
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:24,846
and then I'm pretty much done.


1199
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:28,776
Now two more things
before we go.


1200
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:31,666
When I get to this point, I
want to understand how this--


1201
00:56:31,706 --> 00:56:34,096
how this-- what the end user
experience is going to be.


1202
00:56:34,096 --> 00:56:35,676
So I'm going to need
to preview it.


1203
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:40,116
In version 1, we were able to
preview with an attached iPad.


1204
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:44,586
I'm going to show you
something that nobody knows yet.


1205
00:56:44,586 --> 00:56:47,046
And I'm not going to
claim that we're going


1206
00:56:47,046 --> 00:56:48,296
to ship it anytime soon.


1207
00:56:48,296 --> 00:56:50,566
But I have a special build
of iBooks Author here


1208
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:53,196
that will allow me to preview
to iBooks for the Mac directly.


1209
00:56:55,426 --> 00:56:59,396
So here I can click Preview,
iBooks Author kindly reminds me


1210
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:03,226
that I can't see portrait flow
mode within iBooks for Mac.


1211
00:57:03,976 --> 00:57:12,346
But once it builds its
preview, we should see our book.


1212
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:17,086
So here's the Keynote widget
that I was going to show you how


1213
00:57:17,086 --> 00:57:22,276
to create, but didn't.


1214
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:25,116
Our pop-over widget with a
bit of blown layout there,


1215
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:28,806
our interactive image,
and so on, you get it.


1216
00:57:28,806 --> 00:57:34,396
So all of the elements are here
and previewable within iBooks.


1217
00:57:34,396 --> 00:57:37,386
Again, I can't say when
we're going to ship this.


1218
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:40,026
But we absolutely will.


1219
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:42,406
Now when it comes
time to finally--


1220
00:57:43,386 --> 00:57:45,076
to shift your book
to the iBooks store,


1221
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:47,206
you can do that directly
within iBooks Author.


1222
00:57:47,826 --> 00:57:53,816
So I have another file
here I'm going to open up.


1223
00:58:01,306 --> 00:58:03,306
I mentioned that iBooks
Author works in kind


1224
00:58:03,306 --> 00:58:04,796
of multiuser contexts.


1225
00:58:04,876 --> 00:58:07,706
So what you do in that case
is you have someone build


1226
00:58:07,706 --> 00:58:08,266
the chapter.


1227
00:58:09,326 --> 00:58:10,916
And you're like, "Great,
you got your chapter."


1228
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:12,206
I'm like, "Yeah, I do."


1229
00:58:12,396 --> 00:58:14,746
You go, "OK, you
copy that chapter."


1230
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:19,746
And then you simply paste
it where you need it.


1231
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:21,556
So now we've introduced
that new chapter.


1232
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:22,806
It's not in the right place.


1233
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:23,756
I'm going to drag it here.


1234
00:58:23,756 --> 00:58:26,806
You'll notice that the whole
time that we're composing this,


1235
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:28,686
this thing was reporting
that it was Chapter 1,


1236
00:58:28,686 --> 00:58:30,746
which in fact it was for
this particular document.


1237
00:58:30,746 --> 00:58:33,926
But when we've introduced
it into our new document


1238
00:58:34,066 --> 00:58:35,356
because we're using
those things,


1239
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:37,466
the section numbering fields,
the section titling field,


1240
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:40,926
this thing is now properly
numbered, Chapter 3.


1241
00:58:41,576 --> 00:58:46,336
And everything works within the
table of contents view as well.


1242
00:58:47,716 --> 00:58:49,586
When you publish, you
hit the Publish button,


1243
00:58:50,186 --> 00:58:54,016
iBooks Author does one thing
first, it validates your book


1244
00:58:54,016 --> 00:58:56,226
and make sure that
you're not going to run


1245
00:58:56,226 --> 00:58:59,226
into any errors with
the publishing.


1246
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:08,436
Do you ever try to type
in a room with hundreds


1247
00:59:08,436 --> 00:59:11,176
of people looking at you?


1248
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:12,276
It's not easy.


1249
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,216
It's going to ask you, "Is this
a new book or is this an update


1250
00:59:16,216 --> 00:59:17,416
to a previously published book?"


1251
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:18,846
It is absolutely an update.


1252
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,916
Version 1 is up there
on the store.


1253
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:26,756
Here, all I have to do is add a
new value, increment that value.


1254
00:59:26,756 --> 00:59:28,726
It's worth noting that you
always have to increment


1255
00:59:28,726 --> 00:59:30,006
that value, you can't go down.


1256
00:59:30,006 --> 00:59:31,586
Once you go up and when
it hits the bookstore


1257
00:59:31,586 --> 00:59:33,376
at a current number,
you're stuck


1258
00:59:33,376 --> 00:59:34,516
with that number or above it.


1259
00:59:34,956 --> 00:59:37,056
Another beautiful thing
we've done, sample books,


1260
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:38,266
you don't need to
create one on your own.


1261
00:59:38,716 --> 00:59:40,956
All you have to do is pick
a chapter from your book


1262
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:42,576
that you want to be the
basis of the sample.


1263
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:45,866
And we'll generate the sample
that is 15 pages or 20 percent


1264
00:59:45,866 --> 00:59:47,896
of that chapter,
whichever comes first.


1265
00:59:50,216 --> 00:59:52,666
Then you export your book.


1266
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,366
So close, there we go.


1267
00:59:56,466 --> 00:59:58,636
Little ding notifies me
that my book is exported.


1268
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:01,336
I'm now ready to go to
iTunes producer to finalize


1269
01:00:01,406 --> 01:00:06,406
and ship this to the
iBooks store, again,


1270
01:00:06,406 --> 01:00:07,976
all from within iBooks Author.


1271
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:11,116
So that's it for the session.


1272
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:16,466
A few points I want to leave
you with before I get cut-off.


1273
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:24,046
So as we've shown it's
now, easier than ever


1274
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:26,256
to create this kind of
really interesting content.


1275
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:27,576
The coding isn't required.


1276
01:00:27,576 --> 01:00:29,026
But if you want to
bring it, you can


1277
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:30,406
and it's going to
be very effective.


1278
01:00:30,936 --> 01:00:33,586
Got great new widgets
that allow you


1279
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:35,836
to extend the interactive
experience and make stuff


1280
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:38,896
that is unique out there.


1281
01:00:39,266 --> 01:00:41,546
So you can publish and make
the updates to your books,


1282
01:00:41,546 --> 01:00:43,456
push new versions of your
books to the iBooks store.


1283
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,226
Your end users are going to get
notified directly within iBooks


1284
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,406
that new versions are available.


1285
01:00:47,456 --> 01:00:51,016
So you can continue to give
them updated experience


1286
01:00:51,016 --> 01:00:52,896
to troubleshoot,
extend the content,


1287
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:54,496
add value overtime,
it's all up to you.


1288
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:57,636
And with all these things, we
think it's possible for anyone


1289
01:00:57,686 --> 01:00:59,716
to become a published author.


1290
01:01:00,086 --> 01:01:01,146
That's it for the session.


1291
01:01:01,296 --> 01:01:02,886
Thank you so much
for joining us today.
