00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:25,636
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,046
>> Hello, welcome to Session


4
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,726
2010, What's New in Core Data.


5
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:31,336
I'm Melissa.


6
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:32,176
I'm one of the Core Data


7
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:32,976
engineers.


8
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:34,476
And I will be joined on stage


9
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:35,816
later by Rishi, one of my


10
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:36,436
co-workers.


11
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,006
And we're here to talk about all


12
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,196
of the stuff that we've been


13
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:41,486
working on for the last year


14
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:43,056
because it's been fun for us.


15
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,056
And we're hoping that you'll


16
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,076
find it fun and useful to work


17
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:47,346
with in your applications.


18
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,256
And we will hope all of the


19
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,286
technical problems for this


20
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:51,256
presentation have already


21
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:51,676
happened.


22
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:56,126
So what have we been up to?


23
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,046
We've been doing some Core


24
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,026
Spotlight Integration.


25
00:00:58,336 --> 00:00:59,886
We've added a bunch of new


26
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:00,966
indexing APIs.


27
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,176
And we've added a big new


28
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:03,186
feature called Persistent


29
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:03,886
history tracking.


30
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:04,936
That is what Rishi's going to


31
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:05,446
talk about.


32
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,256
And it's really cool and I'm


33
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:08,226
really excited to see it


34
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:08,836
presented here.


35
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:11,046
But first Alphonse says "Hi".


36
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:11,946
He's my mascot.


37
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,316
I couldn't do this without him.


38
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,356
So CoreSpotlight.


39
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,486
What is Core Spotlight?


40
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:19,236
Before I talk about Core


41
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,096
Spotlight I want to talk a


42
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:21,236
little bit about Spotlight.


43
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,866
Spotlight was the original


44
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:23,986
search API, and search


45
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:25,446
technology on Mac OS 10.


46
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,966
It was very document centric,


47
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:29,046
which meant that the search


48
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,166
results that you would get back


49
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:33,486
from a customer doing a search


50
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:34,916
in the Spotlight menu would


51
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,256
identify the document that had


52
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,586
been retrieved by Spotlight, but


53
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:39,816
wouldn't actually tell you where


54
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:40,976
in the document that hit came


55
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:41,226
from.


56
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:43,316
And it was not really ideal for


57
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:44,596
databases, which as we know can


58
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,966
have lots and lots of records in


59
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:46,666
them.


60
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:48,386
Which brings us to Core


61
00:01:48,386 --> 00:01:48,876
Spotlight.


62
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:50,786
Core Spotlight was the original


63
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:52,116
search technology on iOS.


64
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:53,666
And it was much more


65
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,366
database-friendly.


66
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:56,486
It would return not only the


67
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,746
application and the document


68
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,566
that the user had selected, but


69
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,016
it would also tell you where in


70
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:02,676
that document.


71
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:04,406
It allowed for deep linking into


72
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:05,596
your application so you could


73
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:07,266
bring up exactly the results


74
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:09,246
that your user was interested in


75
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:09,515
seeing.


76
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:11,506
Now it ships on Mac OS, as well


77
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:11,996
as on iOS.


78
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,286
And we thought this is a great


79
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,606
time to integrate with it in


80
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:14,976
Core Data.


81
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,846
So how does Core Spotlight work?


82
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,196
Well it's a lot like Spotlight.


83
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,636
You've got an application.


84
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:21,856
It has a bunch of data in it.


85
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:24,246
The user goes into the Spotlight


86
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:25,596
menu and looks for something


87
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:26,316
that's going to be in your


88
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:26,996
application.


89
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,106
For example, you know, photo


90
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:29,656
from India.


91
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:33,546
And Spotlight launch services


92
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:35,006
launches your application and


93
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,446
you're given a user activity


94
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,846
that you can use to retrieve the


95
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:41,666
information about what the user


96
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,316
was searching for.


97
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,516
Popup, you know, that specific


98
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:47,256
view so your user could see it.


99
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,226
As I said, it's now shipping on


100
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:51,396
Mac OS as well as iOS.


101
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:52,596
And at this point the Core


102
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:53,856
Spotlight team wants me to tell


103
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:55,356
you that you can also use the


104
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:56,856
Core Spotlight API's to access


105
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,146
the Spotlight search indexes


106
00:02:58,226 --> 00:02:59,886
from your application, which is


107
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:00,146
cool.


108
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:02,666
And it does all of this without


109
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,976
scattering zero-length files all


110
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:04,716
over the file system.


111
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:06,086
And I'm really hoping that at


112
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,216
least some of you are mentally


113
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,536
cheering about this because I


114
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:09,016
sure was.


115
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:12,546
So how does it work?


116
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:13,986
There's three basic components


117
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:14,726
to the Core Spotlight


118
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:15,226
integration.


119
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,486
First there's -- we've


120
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:18,756
repurposed the index by


121
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:20,056
Spotlight property on NS


122
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:21,576
Property Description to indicate


123
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,786
that a property should be pushed


124
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,936
into Core Spotlight.


125
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:26,506
But we need a way to specify


126
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,626
what should be showing up in the


127
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:28,756
Spotlight results menu.


128
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:30,416
And that is NS Entity


129
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,606
Description Core Spotlight


130
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:32,606
Display Name Expression.


131
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:34,156
And of course there's an


132
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:34,726
Exporter.


133
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:35,876
That whenever you do save in


134
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:37,826
your application pushes whatever


135
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,266
change the user has made into


136
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:41,106
the Core Spotlight Index.


137
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,146
Core Spotlight Display Name


138
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:45,006
Expression is kind of the


139
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:45,876
trickiest piece of this to


140
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:46,486
understand.


141
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:47,676
It's actually an instance of NS


142
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,256
Expression that you set as a


143
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,936
property on NS Entity


144
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:51,426
Description.


145
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:53,956
And it's evaluated during the


146
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,366
Core Spotlight index update.


147
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,476
With the object -- the managed


148
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:59,106
object that's being updated as


149
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,416
the evaluated object parameter.


150
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:01,966
And this allows you to return


151
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,436
anything that can be pushed in


152
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:04,216
to Core Spotlight.


153
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:05,346
Even something that's not one of


154
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,396
the base Core Data types.


155
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,126
Like for example an instance of


156
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,046
CS Localized String.


157
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:11,216
By and large, these expressions


158
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,566
are going to evaluate Keypaths


159
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,516
but they could be, you know,


160
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:14,436
much more interesting.


161
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,276
They could be built in


162
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:17,216
functions, lowercase, uppercase,


163
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:17,976
stuff like that.


164
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:19,935
Or if you're somebody like me


165
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:21,146
they could be completely random


166
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:23,196
functions that go often dig


167
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,576
around in your runtime to find


168
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:26,516
instances of classes and call


169
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,976
just random methods on them to


170
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,606
get their stuff back.


171
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,536
I think that's cool too.


172
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:33,536
And of course, there's the NS


173
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:34,566
Core Data Spotlight Delegate,


174
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,676
which is like the big and


175
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,906
complicated piece that we wrote


176
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:37,716
that does all the work.


177
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,636
It implements CS Searchable


178
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:41,326
Index Delegate.


179
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,386
It provides default


180
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,086
implementation of all methods,


181
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:45,086
so you can use it straight out


182
00:04:45,086 --> 00:04:46,626
of the box.


183
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:47,806
It uses separate store on a


184
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:48,936
background thread so you don't


185
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:49,926
need to worry about any of the


186
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:51,226
work that's being done by the


187
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:52,976
Spotlight Exporter blocking your


188
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,926
main view context from getting


189
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:55,596
its work done.


190
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:57,686
You initialize it with a NS


191
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,406
Persistent Store Description and


192
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:00,676
a model since it needs to know


193
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,976
what it's working with.


194
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:04,336
And basically you tell a


195
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,956
Persistent Store that it should


196
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:08,606
be exporting its data to Core


197
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:10,586
Spotlight by setting the


198
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,826
exporter as an option when in


199
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:13,616
when you're calling NS


200
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:15,656
Persistent Store with type on


201
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:16,246
the Persistent Store


202
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:16,706
Coordinator.


203
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,256
The override point on the


204
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:20,246
delegate if you don't like the


205
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:22,956
default behavior is NS Data Core


206
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,236
Spotlight delegate attribute set


207
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:25,826
for object.


208
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:27,676
And an override might look


209
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:28,936
something like this.


210
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,146
Here we've got a basic method


211
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,816
that goes through and gets the


212
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:32,806
attribute set return by the


213
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:33,546
super class.


214
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:36,096
It looks at the object, realizes


215
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,006
that this is an instance of a


216
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:38,446
photo because I've got like the


217
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,046
photo app and those photos have


218
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:40,716
tags.


219
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,316
And when somebody searches for


220
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:44,366
something-- when the user


221
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,306
searches for something, that


222
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:46,606
returns a hit on one of those


223
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:47,896
tags, I actually want to return


224
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:49,186
the photo that has that tag


225
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:50,676
because the tag itself is not


226
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:51,396
terribly interesting.


227
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,206
So I go and collapse all of the


228
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:54,746
tag information on to the photo


229
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,516
objects itself so that the photo


230
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,186
will be returned when there's a


231
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,236
match in Spotlight.


232
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:01,446
And then I just return the


233
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:01,956
attribute set.


234
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:04,016
And that's as much code as we


235
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:05,166
expect most of you to ever have


236
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:05,926
to write for this.


237
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:08,986
So now I'm going to do a demo.


238
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:17,206
And I've got a little


239
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:17,926
application here.


240
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:21,326
Please ignore the x Code in the


241
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:23,156
background, we'll get there.


242
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,446
It displays photos.


243
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:28,326
If you scroll around, look at


244
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,976
stuff, click on things to see,


245
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:32,436
you know?


246
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:34,736
Photos of people enjoying


247
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:35,636
themselves with a little bit of


248
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:36,666
meta data information.


249
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,246
But here's the interesting part.


250
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,026
I can now come up to Spotlight


251
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,916
and type in for example,


252
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:47,336
something that I know is in


253
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,386
Spotlight and it automatically


254
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:52,166
activates my application and


255
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,166
calls the application continue


256
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,126
user activity method with an NS


257
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:56,826
user activity.


258
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,006
And here I've broken in that


259
00:06:59,006 --> 00:07:00,366
method so let's see what's going


260
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:00,606
on.


261
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,536
Well, somebody opened something


262
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:04,756
and I'm going to go dig around


263
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:07,106
in that user activities user


264
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,086
info because that's where all


265
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:10,916
the interesting stuff is and dig


266
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:11,686
out the identifier.


267
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:13,746
And if I print that identifier


268
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:15,206
we can see that well, the


269
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:16,826
identifier and the user info is


270
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:18,416
something that looks an awful


271
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,796
lot like a managed object ID


272
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:21,076
string representation.


273
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:23,156
So I'm going to turn that into a


274
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:25,766
URI and ask the persistent store


275
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:27,386
coordinator to turn that into a


276
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,316
managed object ID.


277
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,606
And then I'm just going to


278
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:36,856
continue and hey wow, I've


279
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,726
opened the photo that my user


280
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,236
requested.


281
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:43,836
Lovely, relaxing view.


282
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:48,346
And that sort of how the Core


283
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,846
Spotlight Integration works.


284
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,326
We do most of the work, you need


285
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:54,936
to implement a method that does


286
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:56,196
stuff.


287
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:57,766
So that's the Core Spotlight


288
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:58,276
Integration.


289
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:02,696
Some totally non-sharp corners,


290
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:03,986
stuff we've made easy for you.


291
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:05,516
If you decide that you want to


292
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:06,356
enable the Core Spotlight


293
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:08,726
Integration and pass an exporter


294
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,316
to as one of the options when


295
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:11,316
you add your store to the


296
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,266
persistent store coordinator.


297
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,046
We will automatically start


298
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:15,326
exporting to Core Spotlight on


299
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:16,636
your application's first launch.


300
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,116
And we will continue exporting


301
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,486
until we have exported all of


302
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:20,516
the data even if your


303
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:22,216
application is exited, if the


304
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:23,346
user exits your application in


305
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:23,836
the meantime.


306
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:25,296
We use the Persistent History


307
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,456
Tracking feature to ensure that


308
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:27,576
all of the data is pushed.


309
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:28,946
Even if your application


310
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:31,256
crashes, exits, whatever that


311
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:32,206
doesn't quite work in the seed


312
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:33,106
but it will eventually.


313
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:37,885
Some slightly sharper corners,


314
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,226
the Core Spotlight and Spotlight


315
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,446
integration aren't mutually


316
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,866
exclusive, you can't do both.


317
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:43,226
If you try setting both entities


318
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,956
to Core Spotlight, Display Name


319
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,266
Expression, and the property is


320
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:49,776
stored in External Record, the


321
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:50,736
model compiler is going to


322
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:51,586
complain at you.


323
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,436
And we don't currently track the


324
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:54,626
results of batch operations.


325
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,106
Some slightly sharp corners.


326
00:08:58,346 --> 00:08:59,406
This first one is something I


327
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,446
discovered while debugging


328
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:02,086
because I built all of my unit


329
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:03,326
tests in a separate framework,


330
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:05,676
which is run by XCTest, which


331
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:06,876
doesn't have this entitlement,


332
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,356
which made it very confusing as


333
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:09,056
to why I couldn't talk to


334
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:09,486
Spotlight.


335
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,136
Whatever application is trying


336
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,156
to talk to Spotlight, needs to


337
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:13,486
have the


338
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,686
com.apple.application-identifier


339
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:16,776
entitlement.


340
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:17,896
Most of you are going to get


341
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,096
this by default, but if you're


342
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:20,486
writing your unit tests, which


343
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,826
are run by XCTtest be aware of


344
00:09:22,826 --> 00:09:23,416
this.


345
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:24,486
And of course you're going to


346
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:25,316
need to handle the search


347
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,696
result.


348
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:27,986
You need to implement


349
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,926
Application, Continue User


350
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,216
Activity on your application


351
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:33,796
delegate and you know, put


352
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:35,406
whatever you'd like in there.


353
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,736
We saw this on screen or the


354
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:38,976
demo, but I'm just walk through


355
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:39,436
it here.


356
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,786
This is the method you'd be


357
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:41,406
implementing.


358
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,266
Pretty simple, grab the User


359
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,496
Activity user info.


360
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,766
The identifier manage object ID


361
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,486
is stashed in there under KCS


362
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:50,636
Searchable Item Activity


363
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:51,266
Identifier.


364
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,296
Just turn that into a managed


365
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:55,246
object ID and then you can do


366
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,036
whatever you'd like.


367
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,516
Watch a new window, zoom to the


368
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,696
correct view, whatever.


369
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:03,956
There are however some really


370
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:04,896
sharp corners involved.


371
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,276
Which is that if you were using


372
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:07,666
the old Spotlight integration,


373
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,646
it's going to be up to you to


374
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:12,136
delete your old reference files


375
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:13,236
if you had them on disc, because


376
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:14,056
we can't know if there was


377
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,206
semantic meaning to those.


378
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:18,506
And the Core Spotlight API's are


379
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:20,156
x86 only, which means that this


380
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:21,886
feature is x86 only.


381
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:22,976
So it's time to upgrade your


382
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:23,706
applications people.


383
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,966
And that's Core Spotlight.


384
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,626
We've also added a New Indexing


385
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:30,866
API.


386
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:33,786
So what is indexing?


387
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:35,266
Indexing is a way that allows


388
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,516
you to configure your database


389
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:37,426
to do faster searching.


390
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:40,276
You can have multiple indexes,


391
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:41,706
each of which can have multiple


392
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:42,776
columns, and a column can


393
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,856
actually belong to multiple


394
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:44,426
indexes.


395
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,726
So this allows you to set up a


396
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:47,506
lot of indexes that the database


397
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:49,116
can use to choose the most


398
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,636
efficient index for whatever


399
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:52,346
query it's trying to execute.


400
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:53,336
It will basically look at the


401
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,716
aware clause and say, oh I'm


402
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:55,706
trying to use these columns I'll


403
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:56,896
use this index.


404
00:10:56,896 --> 00:11:00,066
And now I'm going to do a little


405
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,366
bit of a digression on indexing


406
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,416
for those of you, you know,


407
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,256
aren't database heads.


408
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:05,826
The basic form of indexing that


409
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:06,766
supported everywhere by


410
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,986
everything is a Binary Index.


411
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:11,176
But these are very strict


412
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:11,926
comparison only.


413
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,046
They basically look at the bits


414
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,126
and say are these bits the same?


415
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:16,116
And if not, you know, it's not


416
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:17,996
an index head.


417
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:20,596
But over time more types of


418
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,186
indexes have become popular and


419
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:22,966
something that's really


420
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,206
especially nowadays is super


421
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,226
useful is an RTree Index, which


422
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:28,736
is a type of index that's


423
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,216
optimized for doing range base


424
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:30,596
searching.


425
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,626
So a binary index sort of looks


426
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,046
like this.


427
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:33,886
This is the kind of data you


428
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:34,976
might have, a bunch of -- you


429
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:36,886
know, unit dimensional stuff.


430
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:38,166
And if you build a BTree on it


431
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,046
you end up with something that


432
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,696
looks a lot like this.


433
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,266
You know for every node that all


434
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,656
of the nodes -- child nodes to


435
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:47,496
the left are smaller valued than


436
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,556
the parent node and all the


437
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,056
nodes to the right are larger


438
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:52,346
valued and you just navigate


439
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,286
down very, very simply.


440
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:55,456
But RTree Data often looks a lot


441
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:56,326
more like this.


442
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:57,686
You end up having lots of, you


443
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:59,366
know, odd shapes,


444
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:00,696
multidimensional things.


445
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:02,546
They're often overlapping in


446
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:03,706
weird and odd ways.


447
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,736
And there's no really great way


448
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:07,756
to organize those in a unit


449
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,296
directional linear Binary tree.


450
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,716
And RTree Data often is stored


451
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:12,406
more like this.


452
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:14,016
You have a range zero, which is


453
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,216
the minimum bounding blocks


454
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:17,376
around all of its subcomponents


455
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,066
or its set elements.


456
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,106
For example range element fully


457
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,596
contains the ranges R6 and R10.


458
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,506
And R6 in turn has a single


459
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,346
child R7, which has more


460
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:28,706
children.


461
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,056
This is actually a slightly


462
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,516
unbalanced RTree but oh well,


463
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:33,676
we'll live with it.


464
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,616
The current indexing APIs, well


465
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:37,416
we have two of them.


466
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:40,236
You can create a single property


467
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:42,486
index by calling an NS Attribute


468
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,016
Description is Indexed.


469
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,646
Set that property and we'll


470
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:46,606
create an index on it.


471
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,136
If you want to do a multi column


472
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,846
index you'll call NS Entity


473
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:51,196
Description compound Indexes.


474
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:52,726
And that allows you to create an


475
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:53,826
index that has, you know, three,


476
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,016
four, five columns in it.


477
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:56,786
But both of these API's


478
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,886
automatically and only create a


479
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:01,536
Binary Index in ascending order.


480
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:04,376
And we kind of wanted to evolve


481
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:05,696
the Core Data APIs, make them


482
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,236
ore powerful, a lot of them


483
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,406
specifying new and interesting


484
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,376
things, more configurable.


485
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,396
So we've added a bunch of new


486
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:13,306
model classes.


487
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:15,856
First is NS Fetch Index


488
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,916
Description, NS Fetch Element


489
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,516
Description, and we've added a


490
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:20,756
new method on NS Entity


491
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,646
Description indexes which takes


492
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,386
a Fetch Index Description as


493
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,726
it's -- an array of Fetch index


494
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:27,916
descriptions as its parameter.


495
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,876
And we've added some functions


496
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,396
to control whether the database


497
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:32,566
should or should not use a


498
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,316
specific index when its


499
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:35,576
evaluating a given query.


500
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,766
And we've added index by, which


501
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,086
allows you to say, hey really


502
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:39,946
use this index.


503
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:42,406
And no index has existed for


504
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,416
awhile and it's a way of saying


505
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,016
I know better than you and I


506
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:45,846
know better than your query


507
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,146
optimizer, don't use an index


508
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,346
for this specific component of


509
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:50,076
the where clause.


510
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:54,056
NS Fetch Index Element


511
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,456
Description is sort of the basic


512
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:55,956
component.


513
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:57,576
It allows you to specify an


514
00:13:58,136 --> 00:13:59,406
Index Element, basically a


515
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,096
single property.


516
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,236
You can specify the type of


517
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:03,396
index that should be created on


518
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:04,296
that property, whether it's


519
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:06,406
going to be Binary or an RTree.


520
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,426
And if it's Binary index it also


521
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:09,626
has you specify a direction,


522
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:10,746
ascending or descending.


523
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,656
And this can be important if


524
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:13,526
you're doing certain types of


525
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:13,996
searches.


526
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:14,866
For example if you're doing a


527
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,336
male search you want to start


528
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:17,716
with the most recent data first,


529
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,146
instead of the oldest data


530
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:19,596
first.


531
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:21,636
So direction changes the order


532
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:24,616
in which the database will look


533
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,866
at the contents of the index.


534
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:30,436
A Fetch Index Description allows


535
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,066
you to combine a bunch of Fetch


536
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,786
Index Elements into a single


537
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,516
index, which you'll give a name


538
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:37,956
and optionally you can set a


539
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:40,486
predicate that says only put


540
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:41,846
rows matching this predicate


541
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:42,506
into the index.


542
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:44,826
It also does some validation of


543
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:45,956
the index composition to make


544
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:48,266
sure the index you've created is


545
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:49,106
reasonable.


546
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:52,046
Some Sharp Corners here, you


547
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:53,176
can't mix and match element


548
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:54,776
types right now.


549
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,376
It's either going to be an RTree


550
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:57,766
or a Binary index.


551
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,146
Range indexes can only be


552
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:01,866
created on numeric properties


553
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,406
less than or equal to 32 bit.


554
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:04,666
That's a restriction of the


555
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,646
underlying SQLite database.


556
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,306
If you're creating your own


557
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:10,606
incremental store and that's a


558
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,026
restriction -- that's a problem


559
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,006
for you, let us know and we'll


560
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:13,926
see what we can do about it.


561
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,126
But Range -- properties that are


562
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,306
being put in a Ranged Index also


563
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:20,026
can't be optional.


564
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:21,666
Range of null is a little bit


565
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,146
undefined right now.


566
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,676
And if you're building your


567
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,596
model in code and we know some


568
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:27,496
of you do it, and I've helped


569
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,086
some of you at previous WWDC's.


570
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:31,636
If you change your entities


571
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:33,106
structurally after you've set


572
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,136
indexes, then we're just going


573
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:35,916
to drop the index.


574
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:37,236
And that actually applies for


575
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,296
the entire entity hierarchy.


576
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:40,076
If you add or remove an entity


577
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:41,466
in the hierarchy or add or


578
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:42,636
remove properties on any of


579
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:44,276
those entities, we can no longer


580
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,556
be sure the index is valid so


581
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:46,926
we're just going to drop it.


582
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:47,526
Do it last.


583
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,536
As you may know from previous


584
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,126
versions, changing the indexes


585
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:57,406
on an entity doesn't actually


586
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:58,386
change the entities version


587
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:00,206
Hash, which means that there's


588
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:01,986
not going to be migration when


589
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:05,456
the user first launches your new


590
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:06,936
version of your application with


591
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:07,946
the new indexes.


592
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:09,116
So there's not going to be a


593
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:09,676
performance head.


594
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,216
On the other side it's not going


595
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,896
to cause a migration so they're


596
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:13,656
not going to get updated


597
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:14,076
indexes.


598
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:16,126
If you want to cause the index


599
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:17,406
of migration to happen and for


600
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:18,486
the indexes to be updated,


601
00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:19,726
you'll need to call the --


602
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:21,236
Update the model's version Hash


603
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:22,836
Identifier and that will trigger


604
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:23,406
a migration.


605
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:25,926
The SQL store is going to ignore


606
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:26,926
any indexes it doesn't


607
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:27,506
understand.


608
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,686
So what that means is that if


609
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,006
you open your database after you


610
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,486
think you've added indexes and


611
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:34,006
don't see them, go look at the


612
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,496
application console, it probably


613
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,486
told you why you're not seeing


614
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:36,626
them.


615
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:39,706
And I'm going to do another demo


616
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:39,956
here.


617
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:42,036
I have a model here.


618
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:43,826
And I'm actually not going to


619
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,316
work with my live model because


620
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,126
this is a demo and I will


621
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:51,306
inevitably typo something, but


622
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:54,456
adding a new index in the new


623
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,616
modeling tools is actually


624
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:56,126
pretty simple.


625
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:57,776
You select the entity that you


626
00:16:57,776 --> 00:16:59,976
want to add an index to and just


627
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,946
come down here to add entity and


628
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,786
you can now see that it has an


629
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,786
Add Fetch Index option.


630
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:07,836
And you just add one, call it by


631
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:11,856
Location, and I can add a couple


632
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:14,336
of properties to it here -- the


633
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,406
latitude and longitude


634
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:17,006
properties.


635
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,566
And if come over here and select


636
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,286
the photo, you'd come in here


637
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:23,435
and change the Version Hash


638
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:24,046
Modifier.


639
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,686
And now the next time a user


640
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:30,776
launches an application that


641
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,256
uses this version of the model,


642
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,786
they're going to be using the


643
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:35,696
new RTree index.


644
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,636
Of course I am going to just


645
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,426
going to run my demo application


646
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:42,726
which already had that built in.


647
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:44,716
And --


648
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:49,966
-- I'm going to come down here


649
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,606
and grab the Predicate that I


650
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:56,956
have carefully set aside -- oh I


651
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:57,656
forgot one thing.


652
00:17:58,106 --> 00:18:01,556
I'm going to come up here and


653
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,186
edit the scheme, because we want


654
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:04,616
to see what Core Data is sending


655
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,916
to the database.


656
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,836
And I've got the Com Apple SQL


657
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,066
Debug Argument Set.


658
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:10,946
And you'll notice -- for those


659
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:12,486
of you who are familiar with SQL


660
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,796
Debug as a feature in Core Data,


661
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:16,406
you're probably most familiar


662
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:19,076
with 1 and 2 as the numbers --


663
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:20,206
the levels you're going to be


664
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:20,536
setting.


665
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,066
We've added a new level 4, which


666
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,376
will actually print the query


667
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,536
plan that SQLite is using as


668
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:27,886
well as all of the statements


669
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,226
that Core Data is sending to the


670
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:30,816
database.


671
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:31,886
So I'm going to run my


672
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:35,206
application with that version


673
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:35,696
set to 4.


674
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:42,676
Come back, reset that predicate,


675
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,596
and run the search.


676
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:49,646
And now we can come and we see


677
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:50,656
the last search.


678
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:54,296
It's actually kind of more


679
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:55,086
interesting and I'm going to


680
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:57,236
come over here and I've actually


681
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,516
copied and pasted an earlier


682
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:00,626
version into Text Edit, because


683
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:01,746
I could enlarge the text there.


684
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:05,386
But you can see I'm now doing a


685
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:07,226
sub Select against a separate


686
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:10,156
table, Z Photo by Location.


687
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,836
And if I look down in the query


688
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,226
plan, you can see that this is a


689
00:19:14,226 --> 00:19:15,406
virtual table index.


690
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,426
So that's basically routing the


691
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:19,666
location query, the latitude


692
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,586
query down onto a separate RTree


693
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:21,926
table.


694
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,276
And well, we can see up here


695
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,426
that it says it took 0.056


696
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,836
seconds for 16 rows.


697
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,476
And if I go compare this to the


698
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,866
version without the RTree, well


699
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,546
there's the query we were


700
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:34,926
originally doing, Z Longitude


701
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,276
between this and this.


702
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:38,766
And we can see that it took


703
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,906
0.062 seconds for 16 rows.


704
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:42,926
So you got to do about a 10


705
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,176
percent performance improvement


706
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,096
on a laptop with an SSD Fast


707
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:48,606
Cash, all that kind of stuff.


708
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:49,386
So it's about a 10 percent


709
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:50,706
improvement your devices are


710
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:51,756
actually going to -- and it's


711
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:52,926
also a very small data set.


712
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,486
Your devices with a larger data


713
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,356
set are really going to


714
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,296
appreciate having RTree's to


715
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,566
search against instead of


716
00:19:58,726 --> 00:19:59,976
regular Binary Indexes.


717
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:01,756
And --


718
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,326
I think I'm done here.


719
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:11,696
So that is RTree searching.


720
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,236
I have one more slide before I


721
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:15,296
hand you over to Rishi.


722
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:16,656
We've also added some


723
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:17,856
miscellaneous new stuff.


724
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,536
Basically new attribute types.


725
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,816
We've added NSUUIDA Attribute


726
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,806
Type and a NSURL Attribute type


727
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:28,096
backed by the UUID and URL value


728
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:28,976
classes respectively.


729
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:33,546
[ Applause ]


730
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,086
You appreciate the work we do.


731
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:36,196
That makes us feel good.


732
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:37,836
And now I'm going to hand you


733
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:38,126
over --


734
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:41,836
>> Thank you.


735
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:47,036
[ Applause ]


736
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,046
>> Hi everybody I'm Rishi Verma


737
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:49,856
and I'll be showing you


738
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:51,026
Persistent History Tracking.


739
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,936
So let's talk a little bit about


740
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:54,316
your app.


741
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:55,776
So you've developed these


742
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,336
amazing apps and hopefully


743
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:58,706
you've adopted the NS Persistent


744
00:20:58,706 --> 00:20:59,996
Container we introduced last


745
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:00,306
release.


746
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,826
So you've got a View Context set


747
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,446
up and a Background Context.


748
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:05,756
And you've got a Shared


749
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:07,136
Container where you've set up


750
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:07,906
your Persistent Store.


751
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,416
Now your view context is one


752
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,696
connection and your background


753
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:12,636
context is another.


754
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,336
And maybe you've got your


755
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:16,556
background context downloading


756
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:18,336
contend from the remote site


757
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,096
that you have set up.


758
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:22,046
Now you're a very diligent


759
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,316
developer and you've gone out


760
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,716
and created a Document


761
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,686
Extension, a Shared Extension,


762
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,366
and a Photo Editing Extension.


763
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:30,026
Now all of these connections to


764
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,596
your persistent store could be


765
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,066
running in any process since


766
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,456
they're extensions, or they


767
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,506
could be coming from our app


768
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:37,526
from various context.


769
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,146
And you may not know exactly


770
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,396
where this data is coming from.


771
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:42,306
Well, let's break it down a


772
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:44,626
little bit and see what happens.


773
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:49,956
So sorry, so here we are in your


774
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:53,426
app and the user is looking at


775
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,096
your view context and in the


776
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,576
meantime your background context


777
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,416
is downloading info from some


778
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,056
remote source.


779
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:01,406
Unfortunately a common thing


780
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:02,406
that we've seen is that your


781
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,616
Background Context may be


782
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,686
ingesting and your View Context


783
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,046
may not know about these


784
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:09,136
objects, or it may not even care


785
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:09,936
about these objects.


786
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,766
But as your Save Notifications


787
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,266
come in, you're ingesting them


788
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:13,716
anyways.


789
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:16,756
And so you're going to be


790
00:22:16,756 --> 00:22:18,086
missing some changes, if you


791
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,316
missed out new Background


792
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:20,666
Context, because they're really


793
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,736
easy to generate at this time


794
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:23,516
but you may miss out on Batch


795
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,296
Updates, Batch Deletes, which


796
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:26,176
don't generate a Save


797
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:26,826
notification.


798
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:30,626
Now the user's gone into Safari


799
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,426
and decided to share something.


800
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,356
This writes to the database and


801
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:36,596
when you're developer comes back


802
00:22:36,596 --> 00:22:38,306
to the app -- or when you're


803
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:39,556
user comes back to the app, you


804
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:41,076
don't know what's changed.


805
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:42,786
You know something's changed,


806
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,726
but what exactly you don't know.


807
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:46,266
And so you have to rescan the


808
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,016
entire database and see what has


809
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:49,126
changed since you last were


810
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:49,306
there.


811
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,426
And unfortunately sometimes our


812
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:52,986
apps crash.


813
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:55,506
It may be due to the user


814
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,516
quitting your app while a


815
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:58,886
Background Contact was going.


816
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:00,536
And when your app comes back up,


817
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:02,466
your Background Context doesn't


818
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,776
know necessarily where it left


819
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:05,176
off, scanning your local


820
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:05,616
database.


821
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,126
So it'll have to check with


822
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:08,696
remote content and rescan the


823
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:10,476
entire local database to see


824
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:11,696
where it needs to be picked up


825
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,046
again.


826
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:15,166
Let's break this example down


827
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:15,916
just a little bit more.


828
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,316
So we have an app, and it


829
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:19,546
decides to load some data.


830
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,236
So the Background Context loads


831
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:23,056
some data and the View Context


832
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:24,206
gets updated.


833
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,176
Now when the user suspends the


834
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:28,206
app, and the document extension


835
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,506
comes up, we'll see that data


836
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:31,816
inserts two new objects.


837
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:34,456
And then my Share Extension


838
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,606
comes along, updates an object


839
00:23:36,606 --> 00:23:37,556
and inserts another one.


840
00:23:38,096 --> 00:23:39,836
And so does my Photos Extension.


841
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,466
Once all of these are done I'll


842
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,606
come back to my app and notice


843
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,566
that some of the data is stale.


844
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:53,866
So our app here only knows about


845
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,026
these original six objects.


846
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,636
The rest of the database is


847
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,926
actually modified or it actually


848
00:23:58,926 --> 00:23:59,656
doesn't know about these


849
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:00,106
objects.


850
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:02,516
So it has to go through and scan


851
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:03,556
everything and see what's


852
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:05,786
relevant to that View Context or


853
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,656
that Background Context.


854
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:11,086
Now we've introduced NS


855
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,046
Persistent History.


856
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:13,476
It's rather simple.


857
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,996
Grab your Container, grab your


858
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:21,196
Store Description and voila.


859
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,336
Set the option NS Persistent


860
00:24:24,336 --> 00:24:26,476
History Tracking to true and we


861
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:28,036
will now track all of your


862
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:28,946
changes to your database.


863
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:32,036
So let's go back to that


864
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:32,936
previous-- thank you.


865
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:36,856
[ Applause ]


866
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:38,276
So we'll go back to that


867
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,036
previous example.


868
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,036
And now in my View Context and


869
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,536
Background Context load data,


870
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:44,976
we'll see that it happens within


871
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:46,376
a transaction.


872
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:48,116
And this transaction's written


873
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:48,776
to my database.


874
00:24:49,216 --> 00:24:50,326
And I can see that it was done


875
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:52,616
by the Background Context and in


876
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:52,986
my app.


877
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,916
Now when I hop out of my app and


878
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,446
the user goes into a Document


879
00:24:57,446 --> 00:24:57,926
Extension --


880
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:03,126
We'll see that this also


881
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:06,906
generates a transaction and so


882
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,136
on with my share extension.


883
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:12,876
And also the Share Extension


884
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:13,906
will note that there was a


885
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:17,426
modification and not an insert


886
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:17,616
here.


887
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:20,266
And now with a Photos Extension


888
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,436
we'll also see the fourth


889
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,106
transaction come in and we'll


890
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,326
see that it was done in photos.


891
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:28,506
So now when my app is being


892
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:29,736
brought back to the foreground,


893
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,876
I do still have still data, but


894
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,366
now I know where I am in the


895
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,426
history table and can simply go


896
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:37,216
from transaction 1 to 4.


897
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,306
And voila I've updated.


898
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:45,326
So we've introduced a new Store


899
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:46,506
Request for you to fetch your


900
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:46,876
history.


901
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:48,626
It's called NS Persistent


902
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:49,726
History Change Request.


903
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:52,226
You can simply start it up with


904
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:54,796
either a date, a token, or a


905
00:25:54,796 --> 00:25:55,426
transaction.


906
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:59,036
And you can simply set the


907
00:25:59,036 --> 00:25:59,986
result type as well.


908
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:02,736
As simple as a status, the count


909
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:04,016
of change is available.


910
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:05,616
Or you can get nitty-gritty and


911
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:07,306
get all the transactions and all


912
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:07,836
the changes.


913
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:11,376
Also with a change request we


914
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:12,936
allow you to purge your history.


915
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:15,776
So we want you to start this off


916
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,296
and you can delete the history


917
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:19,716
prior to date, a token, or a


918
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:20,396
transaction.


919
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:23,036
Now your Persistent History is


920
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:25,176
linear so this way it will keep


921
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:25,636
it short.


922
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:29,086
One of the caveats we want you


923
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,386
to keep in mind when pruning


924
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,996
your history is that you should


925
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:33,246
have a gatekeeper.


926
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:36,036
Single place where this should


927
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,636
be done so that it knows that


928
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:38,876
you've consumed the history you


929
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,776
need, your clients have consumed


930
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,076
it, and you no longer are


931
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:44,156
removing anything that is


932
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:46,036
relevant to someone else in your


933
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:47,416
app, all right?


934
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,316
And then now we have NS


935
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,026
Persistent History Transaction.


936
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,716
This is a large data blob that


937
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:55,516
covers who did the transaction


938
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:56,106
to your database.


939
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:57,376
So as you can see we have a


940
00:26:57,376 --> 00:27:00,316
Store ID, a Bundle ID, a Process


941
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:02,206
ID, but we also have a Token.


942
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:05,606
Since your history is linear, we


943
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:07,306
provide you a Token that you can


944
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:08,916
encode to disc, so that when


945
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,576
your app exits you can keep


946
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:12,276
track of where your app was in


947
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:12,786
the history.


948
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:15,056
Simply re-launch your app, pull


949
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:16,366
your token, and fetch your


950
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:17,646
history based on that and you're


951
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:18,146
good to go.


952
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:21,616
Now, also in the transaction we


953
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:24,356
allow you -- the author, we want


954
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:25,676
you to go onto your Manage


955
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:28,246
Object Context and tell us who


956
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,296
is the author of this context


957
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,456
and this Save Batch Update or


958
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:33,116
Batch Delete.


959
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:36,266
And so we also allow you to go


960
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:37,916
onto the Manage Object Context


961
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:39,586
and set the Transaction Author.


962
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:41,966
Do this before your save or


963
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:43,596
executing a request and we'll


964
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,136
take this string, put in a


965
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,956
transaction, so you can identify


966
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,926
who did what to your database at


967
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:50,236
a later time.


968
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:53,516
And as part of every transaction


969
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:54,586
there is a set of changes.


970
00:27:55,246 --> 00:27:57,006
A change represents a single


971
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,126
thing that was done to one


972
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:58,636
object.


973
00:27:58,686 --> 00:27:59,976
So they'll be many changes for


974
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:03,166
every transaction and here we'll


975
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,056
have inserts, and updates, and


976
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:05,366
deletes.


977
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:07,366
In the case of an update, we'll


978
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:08,946
tell you which properties were


979
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:11,366
updated -- either attributes or


980
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,516
relationships, and then in the


981
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:17,726
case of a delete we'll tell you


982
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:18,746
what the tombstone is.


983
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:20,376
It's a set of attributes that


984
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:21,876
you can set in the model editor


985
00:28:22,206 --> 00:28:23,466
that allow you to identify the


986
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:24,606
object post mortem.


987
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,316
It's no longer in your database


988
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:27,996
so the object ID isn't as


989
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:30,106
relevant anymore, but with a


990
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:31,646
tombstone you can still identify


991
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:34,206
that object and be able to


992
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:35,376
process it later.


993
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:38,126
Now here we are in the model


994
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:38,566
editor.


995
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:44,086
And I have a unique identifier


996
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:44,656
for this entity.


997
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,896
And it would be great if I could


998
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:46,436
tombstone it.


999
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:49,236
So we simply go in and mark it


1000
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,486
Preserve After Deletion.


1001
00:28:51,366 --> 00:28:52,396
And it's that simple and it will


1002
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:53,346
show up in my tombstone.


1003
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:56,916
And so with that I'd like to


1004
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:57,816
show you a quick Demo.


1005
00:28:58,666 --> 00:28:59,786
So I have a simple app here.


1006
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,846
It takes a post I have and puts


1007
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:03,976
it on my social media feeds.


1008
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,136
I've set it up with a few


1009
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:06,696
buttons here.


1010
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:09,486
A download button that will go


1011
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:10,796
on a background context and


1012
00:29:11,186 --> 00:29:12,986
ingest from the Cloud.


1013
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:15,186
And a background task that will


1014
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,086
go out and post all of my stuff.


1015
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,746
And I've also got a tab where I


1016
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:19,986
can go and see the history.


1017
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:23,576
Currently in my code I have Use


1018
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:24,986
Persistent History set to False,


1019
00:29:24,986 --> 00:29:26,906
but I've enabled it for my store


1020
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:27,816
so that we can see what's


1021
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:28,286
changed.


1022
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:31,926
So here I am and I'll have a


1023
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:32,636
user post.


1024
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:34,306
And this user said, "This demo


1025
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:34,736
is amazing!"


1026
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:36,606
Awesome. And I can also go and


1027
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:37,746
download one from the


1028
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:38,366
background.


1029
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:40,846
And we can see that I've labeled


1030
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,046
where the post came from.


1031
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,046
The first one comes from the


1032
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,216
user, the next one comes from


1033
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:44,816
the background.


1034
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:48,196
But now let's hop out and go to


1035
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:49,146
the Share Extension.


1036
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:52,116
And let's share about Apple here


1037
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:52,636
real quick.


1038
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:00,146
So I can post about this and see


1039
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:00,696
in my app.


1040
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:02,846
And now when we get back to my


1041
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:05,736
app -- oh wait, I lost some


1042
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:06,686
data, this is really odd.


1043
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,626
It must have something wrong.


1044
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:10,256
But if I go back to the history


1045
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:12,526
I can see that I had a post


1046
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:14,276
within the app and I had remote


1047
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:15,906
content and I even can see the


1048
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:16,716
Share Extension.


1049
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,366
However I'm not seeing that


1050
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:21,816
here, like the user I start


1051
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:23,146
adding data and trying to figure


1052
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:24,196
out what's wrong with this UI.


1053
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,296
And my Persistent History once


1054
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:28,396
again is showing everything.


1055
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:29,866
Oh wait, that's weird.


1056
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,656
All of a sudden my app has hit


1057
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:33,826
some refresh that I've


1058
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:35,866
downloaded into it based on some


1059
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:37,816
view where I finally go and hit


1060
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,356
the database and re-fetch


1061
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:40,306
everything.


1062
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:41,766
Because that's the only way I


1063
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,346
can solve this problem sometimes


1064
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,056
and that's frustrating to our


1065
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:45,526
users.


1066
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:48,336
But what happens if we turn on


1067
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:50,036
Persistent History and no longer


1068
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:51,306
have to track things like that?


1069
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,736
So I'll simply turn this on.


1070
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:55,196
So as you can see here real


1071
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:59,006
quick, I have my Background


1072
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:01,086
Context set up and my View


1073
00:31:01,086 --> 00:31:02,776
Context set up and I've also got


1074
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:03,806
them listening to each other.


1075
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:08,466
But I also have some Transaction


1076
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:08,996
Author set.


1077
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,986
And I just want to show you how


1078
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,316
simple that is so that we can


1079
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:12,226
see this going forward.


1080
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:14,986
OK, so let's stop the app real


1081
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,866
quick and re-launch.


1082
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:25,826
And here we are with our app


1083
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:26,766
using History at this time.


1084
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:28,916
And let's go to that troublesome


1085
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,606
case of sharing a post.


1086
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:33,036
Well, High Sierra looks pretty


1087
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:36,666
cool, so let's share about that


1088
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:37,686
real quick.


1089
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:40,756
All right, shared about that.


1090
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:42,086
Real quick let's just share


1091
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:43,076
about one more thing.


1092
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:45,556
The cool new watchOS.


1093
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:56,616
And now when we get back to the


1094
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:56,906
app,


1095
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:02,326
voila. There they are.


1096
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:03,956
All I've done is absorb the


1097
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,926
history, when my view reloaded,


1098
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:08,256
and we can jump to that code


1099
00:32:08,256 --> 00:32:09,546
real quick.


1100
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:19,616
So previously if I was using


1101
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,356
Fetch Hit -- not using


1102
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,256
Persistent History, I was


1103
00:32:22,286 --> 00:32:23,796
fetching everything, but now


1104
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:25,516
that I am all I'm doing is


1105
00:32:25,516 --> 00:32:26,386
fetching the history and


1106
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:28,306
absorbing the merged context


1107
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:29,546
from the History.


1108
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:31,106
And it gives me a much smaller


1109
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:32,386
subset and I no longer have to


1110
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:34,006
scan the entire database to see


1111
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:34,646
what was different.


1112
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:39,636
[ Applause ]


1113
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,576
And so to recap it's rather


1114
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:42,896
easy.


1115
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,596
Simple to enable Persistent


1116
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:44,916
History.


1117
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:46,066
It's just one option on your


1118
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:46,386
store.


1119
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:49,096
It really uncovers all those


1120
00:32:49,096 --> 00:32:49,746
missing changes.


1121
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:51,636
And you may have been generating


1122
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,336
background context, you may just


1123
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:54,396
not realize that you're missing


1124
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:56,116
a notification, you've harnessed


1125
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:57,796
Batch Updates, Batch Deletes,


1126
00:32:58,096 --> 00:32:58,816
which don't generate


1127
00:32:58,816 --> 00:32:59,646
notifications.


1128
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,476
So they uncover all of that.


1129
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,106
And you'll never be in the dark


1130
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,196
again about changes to your


1131
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:04,586
database.


1132
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:09,436
Two caveats to mention about


1133
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:11,246
using persistent history -- the


1134
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,436
first one is about Migration.


1135
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:14,396
We will preserve as much of your


1136
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:16,136
history as possible on migration


1137
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:18,936
except for two cases.


1138
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:21,096
One is if you remove entities


1139
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:22,466
from your model and we already


1140
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:24,556
have history on these entities,


1141
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:26,076
we'll have to remove that


1142
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:27,496
history for those entities and


1143
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,346
that creates a gap.


1144
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,216
The other one is for tombstones.


1145
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:34,396
For tombstones you don't want to


1146
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:35,916
have certain data there after


1147
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,146
awhile to identify the object.


1148
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,246
Maybe it's become a security


1149
00:33:38,246 --> 00:33:39,106
concern for you.


1150
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:41,126
So you've called the tombstone.


1151
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,566
So we'll do the same and we'll


1152
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:44,106
remove that tombstone value out


1153
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:45,176
from the model.


1154
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:46,836
But if that removes anything


1155
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:49,026
that will leave a gap in your


1156
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,856
history, we'll also then only


1157
00:33:50,856 --> 00:33:51,816
preserve your history to the


1158
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:53,296
last complete transaction.


1159
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:56,546
This way you can go and follow


1160
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:58,366
the history without falling into


1161
00:33:58,366 --> 00:33:59,886
a trap where I am missing


1162
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:01,696
changes once again because of a


1163
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:01,976
gap.


1164
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:06,406
As far as performance there's a


1165
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:08,516
slight impact on every save and


1166
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:10,166
every batch-operation you do.


1167
00:34:11,235 --> 00:34:12,255
According to the size of your


1168
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,585
save and your batch operation


1169
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,126
we'll do a slight calculation of


1170
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:16,565
what changed and write that to


1171
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:17,065
the database.


1172
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:19,956
However, once your operation is


1173
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:21,606
complete all of that memory that


1174
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,146
we used is returned back to you.


1175
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:24,716
There's also small storage


1176
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:26,476
overhead, but your history can


1177
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:27,806
be purged, so this makes it


1178
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:29,065
really easy for you to reclaim


1179
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:30,476
that space once you've consumed


1180
00:34:30,476 --> 00:34:30,906
the history.


1181
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:34,766
And that's Persistent History


1182
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:35,056
Tracking.

1184
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:44,716
Now just to summarize what we've


1185
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:45,436
gone over today.


1186
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:46,786
Melissa went over Core


1187
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:47,286
Spotlight.


1188
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:49,556
It's really easy to adopt, easy


1189
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:50,585
to share your data with


1190
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:52,346
Spotlight, and it gives you deep


1191
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:52,746
linking.


1192
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:54,295
So your users can find their


1193
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:56,255
data in your app anywhere on the


1194
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:56,505
phone.


1195
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,806
And the New Indexing API makes


1196
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,566
your searches faster and just


1197
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,856
makes your app that much faster.


1198
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:05,606
And lastly, Persistent History


1199
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,306
allows you to know who's always


1200
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,426
done it, never be lost, always


1201
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:10,316
know who's done what to your


1202
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:10,746
database.


1203
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:14,676
One PSA before we go.


1204
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:15,696
Please file bugs.


1205
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,176
Let us know if you run into an


1206
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:17,496
issue.


1207
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:18,466
Let us know if you want


1208
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:18,906
something.


1209
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:21,526
Go to bugreport.apple.com.


1210
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:22,406
We are listening.


1211
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:24,136
So please go and visit.


1212
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,186
For more information check out


1213
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:28,796
the www.DC website.


1214
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:31,686
And for some related sessions we


1215
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:32,626
had "What's New in Cocoa"


1216
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:33,986
earlier today, so go check out


1217
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:34,466
that video.


1218
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:35,836
We also have "What's New in


1219
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:36,956
Foundation" coming up next.


1220
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,936
And we have some cool stuff on


1221
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:41,246
"What's New in Core Spotlight"


1222
00:35:41,246 --> 00:35:42,366
later on Thursday.


1223
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:44,016
And check out the "Cocoa


1224
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,356
Development Tips" early on


1225
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:45,956
Friday morning.


1226
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:47,276
Thank you very much.
