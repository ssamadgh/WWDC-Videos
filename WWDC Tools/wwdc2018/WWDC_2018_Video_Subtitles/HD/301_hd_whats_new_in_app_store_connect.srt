00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,546
>> Hey everyone.


4
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:28,996
Welcome to our session on what's


5
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,326
new in App Store Connect?


6
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:31,696
My name is Daniel Miao.


7
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,276
And I'm an engineering manager


8
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:35,216
on the App Store Connect team.


9
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:37,096
So what's new?


10
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:39,136
Well, first off, you may have


11
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,676
noticed we changed our name.


12
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:45,666
This is really just a small part


13
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:47,786
of our ongoing commitment to


14
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:48,956
building the best tools and


15
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:50,786
services focused on you, our


16
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:53,146
developers building apps for the


17
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:53,696
App Store.


18
00:00:54,316 --> 00:00:56,696
Now along these lines, we've


19
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,046
also been undergoing a few


20
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:00,596
renovations on our App Store.


21
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,465
So last year, we went back and


22
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,726
we redesigned the iOS App Store.


23
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,896
And following the success of


24
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:12,736
that redesign, this year we also


25
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:14,556
redesigned the Mac App Store.


26
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:17,546
Now with this Mac App Store


27
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:19,846
redesign, we've added support


28
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,126
for a few new features including


29
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:24,766
app subtitles and app previews.


30
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:26,446
You can take advantage of these


31
00:01:26,446 --> 00:01:28,126
features by signing into App


32
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:30,246
Store Connect or by using the


33
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:31,856
XML feed if you use that for


34
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:32,756
automation today.


35
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:37,116
Now for today's session, we're


36
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,686
going to focus on enhancements


37
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,566
we've made to App Store Connect.


38
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:43,646
And we're going to talk about it


39
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,686
within the context of your app


40
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:46,516
lifecycle.


41
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:49,186
This lifecycle typically begins


42
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:50,766
with the design phase.


43
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:54,426
This phase can be both visual or


44
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,106
in code.


45
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,126
And as you make your way around


46
00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:58,746
this lifecycle, you eventually


47
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,486
end up with your app on the App


48
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:03,006
Store followed with an analysis


49
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:05,806
of how your app is doing on the


50
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,366
App Store.


51
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,816
Now more specifically, we're


52
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:10,265
going to focus on a few key


53
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:11,886
areas of this lifecycle.


54
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:13,356
We're going to talk about


55
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:16,026
changes to provisioning, user


56
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:18,826
management, delivering your app


57
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:22,186
into our system, beta testing


58
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:25,476
the builds, and analyzing your


59
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:26,896
biggest business drivers.


60
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:28,966
Now looking at all these


61
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,996
different areas, you can imagine


62
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:32,706
how something like automation


63
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:34,256
could bring all these together


64
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,096
quite nicely.


65
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,826
And we tend to agree which is


66
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,496
why we're very excited because


67
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,236
this summer we'll be releasing


68
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:42,996
an all-new product focused


69
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,176
around automation and we call it


70
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,546
the App Store Connect API.


71
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:52,296
[ Applause ]


72
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:54,616
Now the App Store Connect API is


73
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:57,386
simply a RESTful interface into


74
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,796
your app management experience.


75
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:02,536
To authenticate with the API,


76
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:03,546
you'll be using


77
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:06,066
industry-standard JSON web token


78
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:06,916
authentication.


79
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:08,396
Some of you may already be


80
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,976
familiar with this with other


81
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:11,646
APIs you've worked with.


82
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:14,236
In designing the API, we've


83
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,616
designed it around strict


84
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:16,446
convention.


85
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:17,996
This means whether you're


86
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:19,406
looking at something like naming


87
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:22,196
or error formats, no matter what


88
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,606
corner of the API you're in,


89
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:25,936
everything should feel familiar.


90
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:29,296
And finally, we've been writing


91
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:31,006
extensive documentation for this


92
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:31,336
API.


93
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,116
You might be looking for


94
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:34,826
references around resources and


95
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,756
their attributes or maybe you're


96
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:38,216
simply looking for a guide


97
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:40,476
around how to best use this API


98
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:41,866
for your use cases.


99
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,516
Well, either way and for many


100
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,876
other scenarios, this


101
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,656
documentation will be the place


102
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:48,306
to go.


103
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,926
We'll be launching the API this


104
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:52,256
summer.


105
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:53,346
And we will be launching with


106
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,216
support for the areas of the


107
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:56,346
lifecycle we highlighted


108
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:56,846
earlier.


109
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,476
Now as we add more features and


110
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:01,196
support for other areas, we will


111
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:03,296
be delivering those features to


112
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:03,546
you.


113
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:07,566
So going back to our lifecycle,


114
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,136
let's talk through some


115
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:11,456
enhancements and some API


116
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:12,336
integrations.


117
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,806
We'll begin by talking about


118
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:15,396
provisioning.


119
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:22,046
Now today, many of you rely on


120
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,406
Xcode to manage your


121
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:24,656
provisioning automatically.


122
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:26,246
But for some of you who are


123
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:26,976
looking for a little more


124
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,116
control, today you sign into the


125
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,686
Apple Developer website to


126
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,086
generate the resources you need


127
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,806
to sign your apps.


128
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,026
Well, with the API this summer,


129
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,656
you'll be able to do a lot of


130
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,786
these things directly.


131
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,276
The API will support generating


132
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:45,526
provisioning profiles, creating


133
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:46,576
and revoking signing


134
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,726
certificates as well as managing


135
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:51,156
your devices and your app bundle


136
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:51,246
IDs.


137
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,876
This should make it a little bit


138
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,756
easier for you to integrate your


139
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,326
provisioning activities into


140
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:58,656
your automation process.


141
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:05,546
[ Applause ]


142
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,976
So early on in the lifecycle


143
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:09,286
while you're thinking about


144
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:10,806
provisioning, you're probably


145
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:12,816
also thinking about managing


146
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,686
your users.


147
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:16,726
Now the API is going to support


148
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:19,136
inviting new users to App Store


149
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:21,906
Connect, modifying which apps


150
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,286
your users can see, managing


151
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:26,116
your user's roles as well as


152
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,086
updating profile details.


153
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,566
Now we didn't want to stop at


154
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:32,716
simplifying your management


155
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,286
experience with just the API.


156
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,596
We also wanted to take a look at


157
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,646
how we could simplify where you


158
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,306
go to manage your users in the


159
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,066
first place.


160
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:44,626
Today, you go to both App Store


161
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,156
Connect and the Apple Developer


162
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:47,736
website.


163
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:50,536
But starting this summer, you'll


164
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,746
be able to go to just one place.


165
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:58,976
[ Applause ]


166
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,716
And that's App Store Connect.


167
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,256
Coming to App Store Connect,


168
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:04,266
you'll be able to think about


169
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,836
all of your users within the


170
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:07,686
context of just one set of


171
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:08,176
roles.


172
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,726
And you can manage just one


173
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:12,556
account for each of your Apple


174
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:13,016

175
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:16,136
Now we know that App Store

Connect and the Apple Developer


177
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,046
website, they're very different


178
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:19,496
systems.


179
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,786
So you might be wondering how is


180
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,206
all this going to come together?


181
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,056
Well, that's why we've built a

user's permissions will be


184
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,326
changing once this process is


185
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:30,856
complete.


186
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:33,546
Once we have this preview


187

available, we'll let you know


188
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,686
via Developer News and on the


189
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:39,306
App Store Connect home page.


190
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:42,026
From here, you can click into a


191
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,426
page that looks sort of like


192
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:43,896
this.

00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:49,686
of how their roles will be


196
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:50,206
changing.


197
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:52,636
Of course, some of your users


198
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:54,136
won't be changing at all.


199
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:57,596
Now if you click into a single


200
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:58,976
one of these users, you'll be


201
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,136
able to pull up a modal giving


202
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:03,376
you much more information about


203
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:04,876
that user including what their


204
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,556
permissions will look like going


205
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,066
forward.


206
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:09,966
We encourage you to come in to


207
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,706
App Store Connect and take a


208
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:12,946
look at each and every one of


209
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,626
your users and make any


210
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,726
necessary changes before we


211
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,276
began this process.


212
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,456
And once this process completes,


213
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:22,466
we encourage you to come back


214
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:24,296
one last time to make sure your


215
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:26,296
users are in a state that makes


216
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:28,746
sense to you and after that you


217
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:30,426
simply come back to App Store


218
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:33,136
Connect for any future changes.


219
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,876
All right.


220
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,356
So while some of you were


221
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,426
thinking about provisioning and


222
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,196
user management, others were


223
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,796
working on your apps.


224
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:48,086
Now a natural part of the app


225
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:49,496
development process is, of


226
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:51,486
course, spinning up builds.


227
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:54,186
At some point, you reach a build


228
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:55,526
that you're ready to deliver,


229
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,286
that way you can distribute it


230
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,336
to your customers.


231
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:01,636
Now many of you today are using


232
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:03,086
our tool called Transporter.


233
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,426
For those of you who aren't


234
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:05,866
familiar, Transporter is our


235
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:07,476
command line tool that does many


236
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,966
things and one of those is


237
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,336
delivering your builds into our


238
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:10,766
system.


239
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:12,976
For those of you who use


240
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,076
Transporter today, you know that


241
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,216
macOS is a supported platform.


242
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:20,926
Well, we also know that many of


243
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,266
you use Linux for things like


244
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,716
continuous integration, which is


245
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:26,556
why this summer we'll be adding


246
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,826
Linux as a supported platform


247
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:29,796
for Transporter.


248
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:33,856
[ Applause ]


249
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:35,256
Now you'll continue using


250
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:36,645
Transporter the same way you do


251
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:37,025
today.


252
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,326
And Transporter will continue


253
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,376
allowing you to validate your


254
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,236
builds before you deliver them.


255
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,266
This will save you a lot of time


256
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,716
because you'll know whether your


257
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:48,996
builds are in a good state


258
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,946
before you push us all of the


259
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:51,436
bits.


260
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:54,676
And once we launch the API this


261
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,726
summer, in addition to the


262
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,196
username and password


263
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,256
authentication that you can do


264
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:00,996
today, you'll also be able to


265
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:03,056
use the same API tokens that you


266
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,816
use with the rest of the App


267
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:05,996
Store Connect API.


268
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:11,456
Okay. So now that we have a few


269
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:13,546
builds in the system, it's time


270
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:14,646
to beta test them.


271
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,576
And, of course, beta testing


272
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,246
means TestFlight.


273
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,406
We've got a few enhancements to


274
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:20,896
TestFlight.


275
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:22,596
And I'd like to invite Tommy


276
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,106
McGlynn up to the stage to tell


277
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:24,976
you all about them.


278
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:28,946
[ Applause ]


279
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:30,146
>> Thanks, Daniel.


280
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,866
I'm really excited to be here


281
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:34,126
again talking to you about


282
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:34,686
TestFlight.


283
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:36,626
We've got a new feature to tell


284
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,336
you about, and it deals with


285
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,846
tester acquisition.


286
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,756
Today, all you need to invite


287
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,246
someone to TestFlight is their


288
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:44,956
e-mail address.


289
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,206
You simply enter their e-mail


290
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:48,806
and they'll be sent an


291
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:49,396
invitation.


292
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:52,736
Tapping on the invitation will


293
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:54,076
launch TestFlight where they can


294
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,376
install your beta app.


295
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,086
It's pretty awesome, but if


296
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:58,926
you're dealing with a lot of


297
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,616
testers, it can be cumbersome.


298
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:02,426
And if you're working with


299
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:04,286
testers who don't have an e-mail


300
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,176
address, there isn't an easy way


301
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:06,816
to invite them.


302
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:09,166
We think we can do even better,


303
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:12,036
and we call it TestFlight public


304
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:12,336
link.


305
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,246
[ Applause ]


306
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:16,526
This is really exciting.


307
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:20,146
Public link is a unique URL that


308
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:22,606
represents an open invitation to


309
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,286
your beta app.


310
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:25,946
You can share it anywhere you'd


311
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:26,206
like.


312
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,166
And it can be used by anyone to


313
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,866
become a new tester.


314
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:35,366
So public links can be shared


315
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,806
anywhere that a regular link can


316
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:37,236
be shared.


317
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,156
This means you can send a public


318
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:41,526
link directly to someone, or you


319
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:42,816
could share it on social media


320
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:44,246
to reach a wider audience.


321
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:46,366
If someone wants to become a


322
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,886
tester, they simply tap on a


323
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:49,986
link.


324
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,336
This would launch TestFlight


325
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:52,736
where they can install your beta


326
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,796
app and instantly become one of


327
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:55,426
your testers.


328
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:56,766
It's really easy.


329
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,246
You don't have to collect any


330
00:10:58,246 --> 00:10:58,906
information.


331
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,466
You simply make the link


332
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,126
available and testers can join.


333
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:06,426
So let me show how we can create


334
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:07,066
a public link.


335
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:10,826
In TestFlight, groups allow you


336
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:12,506
to organize your testers and


337
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,706
decide which builds each group


338
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:16,156
of testers should have access


339
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:16,386
to.


340
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:18,616
We'll need to create a group


341
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:19,926
before we can generate a public


342
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:20,206
link.


343
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,066
And we can do that by clicking


344
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:24,936
new group in the left nav and


345
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:28,746
then giving the group a name.


346
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,476
Now before we create a public


347
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,116
link and start bringing testers


348
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:33,816
in, we want to make sure there


349
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,246
is a build that they can test.


350
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:38,066
So first we'll add a build to


351
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:38,526
this group.


352
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:41,276
We do that by going to the


353
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:43,366
builds tab and clicking the plus


354
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:45,146
button next to build.


355
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:47,886
This will show all the builds


356
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:48,496
we've uploaded.


357
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:50,266
And we can choose one that we


358
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,006
want to distribute.


359
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:55,416
Now that this group has a build,


360
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,206
we can create a public link for


361
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:57,676
this group.


362
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,726
We'll go back to the testers tab


363
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,096
and click enable public link.


364
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:07,926
This generates a unique URL that


365
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,656
we can share anywhere to reach


366
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:10,356
new testers.


367
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:14,536
And testers who join through


368
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,146
that link are automatically


369
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:17,066
added to the group.


370
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:19,116
So when you're ready to deliver


371
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:20,936
a new build, you simply add the


372
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:21,756
build to the group.


373
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,176
You can see how this is a much


374
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:26,226
faster way to bring in up to


375
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:27,996
10,000 active testers.


376
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:32,066
If you want more control over


377
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,896
the number of testers or you're


378
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,126
not quite ready for your beta


379
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,126
app to go viral, you can easily


380
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:39,346
set a custom tester limit on


381
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:40,116
each public link.


382
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:42,586
This would put a cap on the


383
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:44,446
number of testers who could join


384
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:44,976
through that link.


385
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,326
You also have the ability to


386
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:50,906
disable the public link at any


387
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,786
time at which point new testers


388
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,396
would no longer be able to join.


389
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,036
If someone tries to open a link


390
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:01,036
once it's been disabled, they'll


391
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:02,516
receive a message letting them


392
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,616
know this beta isn't accepting


393
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,506
any new testers.


394
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:10,176
I also want to show what happens


395
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,346
when someone taps on a public


396
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:12,996
link and doesn't have TestFlight


397
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:13,436
installed.


398
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,916
They'll land on a localized page


399
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,016
that explains how to install


400
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,876
TestFlight and get started as a


401
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:21,486
beta tester.


402
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,886
This will make it a lot easier


403
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,686
for brand-new testers to begin


404
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:26,946
testing your app.


405
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:30,786
I'd also like to mention that


406
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:32,556
you'll soon be able to do all of


407
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:34,686
this without using the App Store


408
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:36,616
Connect UI at all.


409
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:39,456
This will be possible using the


410
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:41,046
new App Store Connect API.


411
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,646
You'll be able to automate the


412
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:46,556
creation of groups, assign


413
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:49,626
builds to groups, manage public


414
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:52,636
links, add and remove testers,


415
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:55,336
and update test information.


416
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,416
All of this can be automated


417
00:13:57,646 --> 00:13:58,956
using our new REST API.


418
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:02,836
Thank you.


419
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:06,856
We have an entire session


420
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:07,986
devoted to the new App Store


421
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:08,726
Connect API.


422
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:10,636
And I strongly encourage you to


423
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:12,866
check it out tomorrow at 3:00.


424
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,086
That's TestFlight public link.


425
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,416
And I'm really excited to see


426
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,686
what you're able to do with this


427
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:18,226
new feature.


428
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:18,926
Thank you.


429
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:25,586
[ Applause ]


430
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:26,676
>> Thanks, Tommy.


431
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,466
Well, TestFlight public links


432
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:31,016
and the new TestFlight APIs are


433
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,706
just two more ways for you to


434
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,546
streamline your beta


435
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:36,146
distribution process.


436
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,386
So now that we've gone through a


437
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:40,836
successful round of beta


438
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:43,796
testing, prepared our App Store


439
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,786
metadata, gone through app


440
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,016
review, and now our app is in


441
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,676
the hands of our customers.


442
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:53,036
Now it's time to take a look at


443
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:55,146
some hard numbers to see how our


444
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:56,286
customers are actually


445
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,606
responding to our apps.


446
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:00,226
So the first place we can look


447
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:02,356
at this is in sales and trends.


448
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:05,676
Just this week we launched an


449
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,466
all new sales and trends


450
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:08,386
overview page.


451
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:11,326
This page gives you a summary of


452
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,766
your biggest business drivers


453
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,536
like app units, in-app


454
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:16,246
purchases, and sales.


455
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:18,846
As you scroll down this page,


456
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,466
you'll see your top apps and how


457
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:22,876
they contribute to each of these


458
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:23,506
metrics.


459
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:25,916
Here, when you look at these


460
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,596
sales numbers, these numbers


461
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:30,256
include not just app sales but


462
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,496
also in-app purchase sales from


463
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:33,476
within those apps.


464
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,776
As we scroll down towards the


465
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:38,716
bottom, we'll see these same


466
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,406
metrics broken down by territory


467
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:42,506
and by device.


468
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:44,556
After looking at all this


469
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:47,076
information, you'll know better


470
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,426
where to focus your efforts.


471
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:54,156
Now another place we can look is


472
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,306
in your generated reports to see


473
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:57,236
how your app is doing.


474
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,266
Today, in order to download your


475
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,086
generated reports, you use a


476
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,736
reporter tool but beginning this


477
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:06,336
summer you'll be able to do the


478
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:08,036
same thing directly with the


479
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:08,436
API.


480
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:10,516
And we'll be supporting the


481
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:11,866
download of both financial


482
00:16:11,866 --> 00:16:14,786
reports and sales reports.


483
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,716
This will make it easier for you


484
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,196
to integrate reporting in to


485
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:20,116
your process.


486
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:24,176
So we've been talking about a


487
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:25,156
lot of features.


488
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:26,856
And so far they've mostly been


489
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:29,126
centered around your web and


490
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,416
your desktop experience.


491
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:33,186
So now we'd like to move on and


492
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,066
talk about our all new mobile


493
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:35,746
experience.


494
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:36,986
And I'd like to invite Alex


495
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,976
Miyamura up to the stage to tell


496
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:39,776
you all about it.

00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:47,686
>> Thanks, Daniel.


499
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:50,346
We know that the involvement


500
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:52,196
with your apps doesn't stop the


501
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:53,486
moment that you step away from


502
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:53,946
your Mac.


503
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,166
You may have a version of one of


504
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,156
your apps that you've been


505
00:16:57,446 --> 00:17:00,066
working on hard for quite a long


506
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,316
time that you're just itching to


507
00:17:01,316 --> 00:17:03,766
release and it's now in app


508
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:04,076
review.


509
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:06,486
You may just have released a


510
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:08,776
version of one of your apps, or


511
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:09,685
you may just want to see how


512
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:11,215
your apps are doing, check out


513
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:12,786
their sales and trends or their


514
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:13,766
ratings and reviews.


515
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,646
And for that reason, we've


516
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:18,236
created a brand-new App Store


517
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,195
Connect experience for iOS.


518
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:22,816
This experience is centered


519
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:24,536
around giving you the ability to


520
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:26,316
access your apps data on the go


521
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,006
as well as empowering you to


522
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,256
take certain quick actions and


523
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:33,256
letting you know exactly when


524
00:17:33,256 --> 00:17:33,886
you can take them.


525
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:36,576
Now let's start with sales and


526
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:36,946
trends.


527
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:39,766
When you tap into your trends


528
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,256
tab, you'll see this gorgeous


529
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:42,646
graphical summary of your app's


530
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,346
performance over the past 7


531
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:44,636
days.


532
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,556
You'll see your app's units and


533
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:48,146
proceeds.


534
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,576
Scrolling down, you'll see


535
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:53,866
sales, updates, and then in-app


536
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,026
purchases and app bundles.


537
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,056
Now we know that you implement


538
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:00,716
diverse modernization strategies


539
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:01,546
across your apps.


540
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:04,106
Some of you have paid apps, free


541
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,046
apps, apps with in-app


542
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,846
purchases, or you may leverage


543
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:07,596
subscriptions.


544
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,046
Now we know that and we wanted


545
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:10,926
to give you the ability to


546
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:12,736
select exactly which of these


547
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:14,976
graphs are most relevant to you.


548
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:17,576
So we've added this edit


549
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:18,956
function where you can select


550
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:20,276
the graphs you'd like to see.


551
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,936
So let's say that, in my


552
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,786
business, I only have free apps.


553
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:27,366
I'll go ahead and unselect


554
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:31,136
proceeds, sales, in-app


555
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:33,596
purchases, and app bundles.


556
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,126
Hit done and, voila, now I just


557
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,766
see units and updates, exactly


558
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,446
what's relevant for my business.


559
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,276
Next, we're going to take a look


560
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:44,806
at the time selection control


561
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:47,076
underneath the trends title.


562
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,306
In iTunes Connect mobile, we


563
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:52,306
allow you to see the status from


564
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:55,116
7 days all the way to 26 weeks.


565
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:57,676
Now this was amazing if you are


566
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:58,696
interested in longer-term


567
00:18:58,696 --> 00:18:59,686
trends, right?


568
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,566
But what about an app that you


569
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:02,516
just released?


570
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:04,686
You might not even have 7 days'


571
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,366
worth of data.


572
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,096
And if you want to compare those


573
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:08,496
7 days to the previous 7 days,


574
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:09,726
well obviously you're not going


575
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:10,406
to have that.


576
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,806
So in App Store Connect, we


577
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:15,006
introduce the 1 day view.


578
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:17,156
In this view, you can see how


579
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,436
your apps are during day over


580
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,616
day even just a few days after


581
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:21,046
launch.


582
00:19:21,846 --> 00:19:23,666
Of course, some of you are still


583
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,806
going to be interested in


584
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:26,126
longer-term trends, right?


585
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,706
So we still offer you the


586
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:29,626
ability to view your apps data


587
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:35,516
over 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 13 weeks,


588
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:37,956
and 26 weeks.


589
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:40,446
You can also drill down into


590
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:42,106
each one of these graphs in more


591
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:42,596
detail.


592
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:44,346
So we're going to take a look at


593
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,116
units right now.


594
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,576
When you tap into one of these


595
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:49,076
graphs, you'll see a breakdown


596
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,616
across your free apps, your paid


597
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:52,416
apps, and in-apps for the


598
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,406
iOS/tvOS App Stores as well as


599
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:57,576
the redesigned Mac App Store.


600
00:19:58,346 --> 00:19:59,756
You can also take a look at a


601
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:01,516
deeper dive into any one of


602
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:02,876
these cells just by tapping on


603
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:02,976
them.


604
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,636
So let's go ahead and tap the


605
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,686
free iOS/tvOS app cell.


606
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:11,086
Now you can see data about each


607
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,576
one of your apps in more detail


608
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:14,816
and also your apps top


609
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:15,476
territories.


610
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:17,906
If you're interested in seeing


611
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:19,646
more territories, you can tap


612
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:20,446
the show more button.


613
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:22,966
Now you can see the territories


614
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,486
that your apps are available in


615
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:25,186
worldwide.


616
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,636
You can also take a look at your


617
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,086
apps data individually as


618
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:31,356
opposed to this aggregate view


619
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:33,356
by taking a look at the my apps


620
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:35,456
tab which we'll do next.


621
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,176
When you tap into the my apps


622
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,616
tab, you'll see a list of your


623
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:40,346
apps, obviously.


624
00:20:40,736 --> 00:20:42,576
But what if you're a member of


625
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,936
more than one development team?


626
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:45,286
So do we have anyone in the


627
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,816
audience that is, indeed, a


628
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:47,526
member of more than one


629
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:48,186
development team?


630
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,306
Cool. So it's actually quite a


631
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:50,746
bit of you.


632
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:51,986
So that's awesome.


633
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,596
And that's exactly why we've


634
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:55,636
introduce the ability to select


635
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:57,276
which development team you'd


636
00:20:57,276 --> 00:20:58,796
like to see within App Store


637
00:20:58,796 --> 00:20:59,146
Connect.


638
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,516
So we'll tap the little account


639
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:01,876
button.


640
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:03,966
That brings up settings.


641
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:05,576
And you'll see the account cell.


642
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:08,536
We'll tap into that, select the


643
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:09,936
team that we'd like to see


644
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:12,096
within App Store Connect, and


645
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:13,036
dismiss this.


646
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,486
Now we see exactly the apps that


647
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:16,806
we're interested in right now.


648
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:20,246
Let's go ahead and take a look


649
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,766
at one of the apps within our


650
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,606
apps list, Mountain Climber.


651
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:25,816
When we tap into Mountain


652
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:26,736
Climber, you'll see four


653
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:27,316
sections.


654
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,386
The first section that you see


655
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:30,986
is the iOS app section.


656
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:32,606
And here you'll see your iOS


657
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:33,106
versions.


658
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,856
If your app has a tvOS app


659
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:38,326
version, you'll see the tvOS app


660
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,096
section and, obviously, the tvOS


661
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:41,496
app versions underneath.


662
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,496
Now we also have App Store


663
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:45,296
information.


664
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:46,966
And remember that I noted that


665
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:48,706
you can see your apps trends


666
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:49,556
data individually.


667
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:51,686
Well, all you have to do is tap


668
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,946
into that cell and you'll be


669
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:53,476
taken there.


670
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:56,116
Now, finally we have


671
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:57,086
notifications.


672
00:21:57,786 --> 00:21:59,316
And we're going to do something


673
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,556
a bit unorthodox here.


674
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:01,546
We're actually going to start


675
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,906
from all the way at the bottom


676
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:04,506
with notifications.


677
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:06,996
There are two types of


678
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:08,176
notifications that you can


679
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:10,066
receive within the App Store


680
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:10,666
Connect app.


681
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:13,076
The first one is for app status


682
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:13,536
changes.


683
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,436
And this is something like when


684
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:17,726
your app is in review and then


685
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:19,906
goes to pending developer


686
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:20,906
release when it's approved.


687
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:23,566
The next one that you can take


688
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,346
is for reviews with a certain


689
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:27,206
star rating.


690
00:22:28,006 --> 00:22:29,546
And so we're going to go ahead


691
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:31,676
and select the five-star review


692
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:33,276
because we want to thank users


693
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:35,626
that are enjoying our app as


694
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:37,446
well as the one-star review


695
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:38,986
because we want to engage users


696
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:40,356
that, for whatever reason, are


697
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:41,596
not having the best of


698
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:42,416
experiences.


699
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:44,696
Now that we've selected our


700
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,916
notifications, we're going to go


701
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:46,776
back to the app view.


702
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:49,486
The reason why we started with


703
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:51,506
notifications is because one of


704
00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:53,086
the key tenets of the App Store


705
00:22:53,086 --> 00:22:55,286
Connect experience on iOS is


706
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,806
giving you the ability to take a


707
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:58,776
quick action around your apps


708
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:00,676
and letting you know when you


709
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:01,356
can do so.


710
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:03,976
So we know that you've taken --


711
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,036
you've spent countless hours


712
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:06,726
working on your apps.


713
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:09,006
You've distributed them to beta


714
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,446
testers via TestFlight.


715
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:12,356
You've taken those testers


716
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,186
feedback, iterated upon that


717
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,146
with your apps, and finally you


718
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,546
have a build that's ready for


719
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:18,436
release to the world.


720
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:20,716
Now one of the last things you


721
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,216
have to do before releasing your


722
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:23,236
app to the world is, of course,


723
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,086
submitting your build to app


724
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:25,376
review.


725
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:28,906
One of the notifications that we


726
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:30,166
just set up in the App Store


727
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,966
Connect app was for app status


728
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:32,516
changes.


729
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:34,876
This means that when your app is


730
00:23:35,006 --> 00:23:36,696
approved by app review, you'll


731
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,856
receive a push notification that


732
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,526
tells you this happy news.


733
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,946
The second that you received one


734
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,656
of these notifications, you can


735
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,316
open App Store Connect wherever


736
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:46,776
you are.


737
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,986
And we'll go to the version


738
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:49,246
view.


739
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,546
You'll now see that our app


740
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:52,846
Forest Explorer is pending


741
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:53,746
developer release.


742
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,146
We'll scroll down and you'll see


743
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:56,596
two buttons.


744
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:58,366
The first one that you'll see is


745
00:23:58,366 --> 00:23:59,176
this big red button.


746
00:23:59,176 --> 00:23:59,886
It's really obvious.


747
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:00,746
Reject this binary.


748
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:02,786
We don't want to do that, but


749
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:04,296
now we see release this version


750
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:05,856
and that's exactly what we want


751
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:06,176
to do.


752
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:06,856
We'll tap there.


753
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:08,896
We'll get a confirmation dialog


754
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:10,136
and we'll hit release.


755
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:12,576
Now we sent that build off to


756
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:12,946
the world.


757
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:15,766
Sometimes you don't get the


758
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,576
happiest push notifications and


759
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:18,306
this is one of them.


760
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,266
Right. Sometimes your app may be


761
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,636
rejected by app review.


762
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:22,916
And, obviously, that's something


763
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,986
that no one wants to see.


764
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,236
Later in our session, my


765
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:27,776
colleague Daniel is going to go


766
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:29,156
over some tips and tricks from


767
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:30,376
app review to make sure that


768
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:31,656
this never happens to you.


769
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:33,626
But what should we do now?


770
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:34,896
We need to make sure that we can


771
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,716
get this app approved and out


772
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,316
there to the world.


773
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,586
Now what we're going to do is


774
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,746
open up App Store Connect.


775
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,266
And under App Store information,


776
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:45,166
you'll see this warning badge


777
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:46,926
next to resolution center.


778
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,636
Within resolution center, you'll


779
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:50,896
be able to see app reviews


780
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:52,346
feedback for your app.


781
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,836
You can tap into one in more


782
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:57,696
detail and, of course, reply to


783
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,746
it on the go.


784
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:01,716
Now once we send our response


785
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:03,216
back to app review, they'll get


786
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:04,726
a chance to review it and


787
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:06,266
hopefully our app will be


788
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,356
approved at once.


789
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,836
Now once your app has been


790
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:11,476
submitted to app review, once


791
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,966
it's been approved, and you've


792
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,046
used App Store Connect to


793
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,476
release it, the next thing that


794
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,076
you'll be receiving his customer


795
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:17,586
feedback.


796
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,936
And here's one of the


797
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:20,856
notifications that you may


798
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,356
receive, a five-star review.


799
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:24,906
Now recall we set up


800
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:26,896
notifications for one and


801
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,066
five-star reviews within App


802
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:28,466
Store Connect.


803
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:31,616
Since we set these up, you'll


804
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:33,916
know the very minute a customer


805
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,326
submits one of these reviews.


806
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:38,186
You can access all customer


807
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,816
feedback within App Store


808
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:42,316
Connect by accessing the ratings


809
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,236
and reviews section where you'll


810
00:25:44,236 --> 00:25:45,386
be able to see your current


811
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:47,356
rating across any one of the


812
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:49,426
territories you've selected or,


813
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:50,616
obviously, all territories.


814
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:52,806
You can also take a look at your


815
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:55,246
reviews, read them in more


816
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:57,336
detail, and reply to them.


817
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:59,736
Now this is a satisfied customer


818
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:00,876
so we're going to thank them for


819
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:01,876
the positive feedback.


820
00:26:03,156 --> 00:26:04,546
That covers App Store Connect


821
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,506
notifications and the quick


822
00:26:06,506 --> 00:26:07,496
actions that you can take from


823
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:09,466
them but there's one more thing.


824
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:12,036
We've also optimized App Store


825
00:26:12,036 --> 00:26:14,416
Connect for iPad.


826
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,796
So let's take a quick look.


827
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,316
As I mentioned earlier, you can


828
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:19,896
view a certain apps sales and


829
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:20,496
trends data.


830
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,056
And here is sales and trends for


831
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:22,856
Forest Explorer.


832
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,146
You can see units.


833
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:26,766
And we'll scroll down to updates


834
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:29,606
and also drill down into the


835
00:26:29,606 --> 00:26:30,506
territories view.


836
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:33,376
Now I'm sure you want to try


837
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:34,356
this out on your own.


838
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:36,076
And our app is actually


839
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:36,706
available now.


840
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:37,996
So if you haven't downloaded it


841
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:39,706
already, please go ahead and do


842
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:40,016
so.


843
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:41,936
We've worked hard to bring an


844
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:43,676
experience -- an improved mobile


845
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:44,556
experience to you.


846
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,106
And we hope you'll enjoy using


847
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,246
it as much as we enjoyed


848
00:26:47,246 --> 00:26:47,796
creating it.


849
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:50,266
And with that, now back to


850
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:50,646
Daniel.


851
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:57,036
[ Applause ]


852
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:58,226
>> Thanks, Alex.


853
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:00,316
So that's a beautiful new app


854
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,336
that'll give you even more power


855
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:04,606
to manage your apps on the go.


856
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:08,536
So next we'd like to talk about


857
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,726
a guideline change we made just


858
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:13,236
this week that will let those of


859
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,556
you with paid apps offer


860
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:18,306
time-based free trials for your


861
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:18,996
customers.


862
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:23,146
Now those of you who are using


863
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,906
subscriptions today know that


864
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:27,046
free trials are a great way to


865
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,496
attract new customers to your


866
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,226
services.


867
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:30,816
But we also know that


868
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,546
subscriptions aren't the model


869
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:35,246
that works for every app which


870
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:37,166
is why we're happy to now have a


871
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,396
path for paid apps.


872
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:41,276
So we're going to take a look at


873
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,976
what this setup looks like.


874
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:45,726
So let's say we start with a


875
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:46,286
paid app.


876
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:48,906
The first thing you would do is


877
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:51,586
turn your paid app into a free


878
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:51,876
app.


879
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:55,286
Now on top of this free app,


880
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:56,586
you're going to add two


881
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,856
non-consumable in-app purchases.


882
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:02,076
The first is a free tier 0


883
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:04,276
priced non-consumable.


884
00:28:04,756 --> 00:28:05,876
And you'll present this to your


885
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:07,066
customers when they launch the


886
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:10,076
app so that they can opt-in to


887
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:10,946
the free trial.


888
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:15,026
Now the second non-consumable is


889
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,696
the in-app purchase that you use


890
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,796
to unlock your app functionality


891
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:20,626
for that customer for good.


892
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:23,136
You can present this at any


893
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,376
point; in the beginning when


894
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,256
they launch the app or when


895
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:27,956
their free trial is complete.


896
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:32,186
Now in order to use this setup,


897
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:34,816
there are a few guidelines to


898
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:35,976
look out for and to follow.


899
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:40,786
First, make sure you name your


900
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,356
trial in-app purchase with this


901
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:44,246
naming convention.


902
00:28:44,866 --> 00:28:47,096
And next, you'll want to make


903
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,596
sure that it's very clear to the


904
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:49,956
customer exactly what they are


905
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:50,766
signing up for.


906
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:53,456
So please make sure that they


907
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:54,976
know how long the free trial is


908
00:28:54,976 --> 00:28:56,786
going to last, how much it'll


909
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,406
cost to unlock the


910
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:00,826
functionality, and what kind of


911
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,936
features and content won't be


912
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:04,336
available anymore after the


913
00:29:04,336 --> 00:29:06,246
trial if they decide not to


914
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:06,776
continue.


915
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:10,576
All right.


916
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:12,136
So we talked about a number of


917
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,136
new features today.


918
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:14,906
So let's take a second to recap


919
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:15,156
them.


920
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:17,386
First, we're launching an


921
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:19,316
all-new App Store Connect API


922
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:20,426
this summer.


923
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:24,336
We're unifying where you go to


924
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:25,336
manage your users.


925
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:30,126
We've extended app Transporter


926
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:32,696
to support Linux.


927
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,706
We're launching TestFlight


928
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,106
public links, which will make it


929
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:39,116
a lot easier for you to invite


930
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:40,396
large numbers of testers.


931
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:43,266
We've launched a brand-new sales


932
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:46,416
and trends overview page, a new


933
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:48,556
App Store Connect for iOS page,


934
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:50,936
and a path for you to offer


935
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:53,876
trials to customers on your paid


936
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,356
apps.


937
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,466
Now these are features that will


938
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,506
be launching between now and the


939
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,146
end of the summer.


940
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:01,926
But we also have two significant


941
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,226
features we launched over the


942
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:04,896
past year that we'd like to


943
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:05,336
highlight.


944
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,466
And these are intro pricing and


945
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:09,166
pre-orders.


946
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:13,796
So introductory pricing, for


947
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:14,656
those of you who use


948
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:17,246
subscriptions, is a great way to


949
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:18,946
incentivize new customers to


950
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:20,376
sign up for your subscriptions.


951
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:23,236
Now you do this by offering your


952
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:25,296
customers a discounted


953
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:27,546
introductory price at the


954
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:29,076
beginning of your subscription.


955
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:31,246
There are three different


956
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,456
pricing models we offer for


957
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:32,846
this.


958
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:35,576
First, we have free trials.


959
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,106
Now with free trials, your


960
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:40,656
customers sign up for free.


961
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:43,016
They use your services for the


962
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:44,056
introductory period.


963
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,816
And at the end of the period,


964
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,806
they move on to your regular


965
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,766
subscription price.


966
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,566
Next, we have a model that we


967
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:52,706
call pay upfront.


968
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:54,616
With this model, your customers


969
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:56,416
sign up and they pay one time at


970
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,196
the beginning of your


971
00:30:57,196 --> 00:30:58,096
introductory period.


972
00:30:58,856 --> 00:30:59,796
And, again, at the end of the


973
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,806
period, the regular subscription


974
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:03,006
price kicks in.


975
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:06,886
And finally, we have pay as you


976
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:07,236
go.


977
00:31:07,856 --> 00:31:09,006
With pay as you go, your


978
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:11,246
customers pay a recurring


979
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:13,416
discounted price during the


980
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,486
introductory period.


981
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,446
Now once the entire period has


982
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:19,486
been completed then they move on


983
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:20,546
to the regular subscription


984
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,026
price.


985
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:23,576
Now we have two related sessions


986
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,386
that happened yesterday that


987
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,656
have more information around the


988
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:28,846
StoreKit side and best practices


989
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,756
around both intro pricing and


990
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:31,506
subscriptions.


991
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,336
They are Best Practices and


992
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:34,776
What's New with In-App Purchases


993
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:36,386
and Engineering Subscriptions.


994
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:38,376
So check those out if you have a


995
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:38,836
chance.


996
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:42,986
So next we have pre-orders.


997
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,876
Now pre-orders are a great way


998
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,096
for you to drum up excitement


999
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:48,056
for your app before your app is


1000
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:50,116
actually available for download


1001
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:51,246
or purchase.


1002
00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:54,346
In order to set up a pre-order,


1003
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,726
you can take any app that has


1004
00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:58,046
not yet been released on the App


1005
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:01,186
Store and you can enable it.


1006
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,456
After you submit it to app


1007
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:03,646
review and that app has been


1008
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:06,196
approved, you can release that


1009
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:07,876
app to the App Store as a


1010
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:08,406
pre-order.


1011
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:12,006
Once that pre-order period is


1012
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:13,426
over and your customers have


1013
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:17,386
signed up for your pre-order,


1014
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:18,846
your app will move into ready


1015
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,206
for sale state where your


1016
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:22,386
customers can now download or


1017
00:32:22,386 --> 00:32:23,866
purchase that app.


1018
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:26,436
It's also at this transition


1019
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:28,036
that customers that have signed


1020
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:29,416
up for your pre-order are


1021
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,966
charged for the price of your


1022
00:32:31,146 --> 00:32:31,746
app.


1023
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:35,226
Now let's take a look at how you


1024
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:36,336
might set this up in App Store


1025
00:32:36,336 --> 00:32:36,676
Connect.


1026
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:39,356
We begin here on the pricing and


1027
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:40,316
availability page.


1028
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,366
Again, if this app has never


1029
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:43,856
been released to the App Store,


1030
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:45,776
you'll see a section in the


1031
00:32:45,776 --> 00:32:47,666
middle here labeled pre-orders.


1032
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:48,666
Here, you can enable your


1033
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,806
pre-orders and set a release


1034
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:51,076
date.


1035
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,926
This release date is a date on


1036
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:55,996
which your app goes from being


1037
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:57,376
available as a pre-order on the


1038
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:00,106
App Store to being available as


1039
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:01,586
a download or purchase on the


1040
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,086
App Store.


1041
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:03,376
In other words, this is when it


1042
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:04,536
goes from pre-order ready for


1043
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:06,126
sale to ready for sale.


1044
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:09,096
Now once you've gone through app


1045
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:10,396
review and your app is in


1046
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:11,766
pending developer release state,


1047
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,116
you'll see a button in the top


1048
00:33:13,246 --> 00:33:14,026
right corner.


1049
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:15,966
This is the release pre-order


1050
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:16,326
button.


1051
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:18,306
You click this button to make


1052
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:19,406
your app available on the App


1053
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:20,956
Store as a pre-order.


1054
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:24,756
Once you do this, you'll see a


1055
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,436
banner at the top of the page


1056
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:28,686
telling you when your pre-order


1057
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:31,796
started and when it completes.


1058
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:33,796
This completion date is simply


1059
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:35,416
the release date that you set


1060
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:36,466
for your app.


1061
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:38,336
Now if you'd like to release


1062
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:40,136
this app before the release date


1063
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:42,956
or more immediately, you can


1064
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:45,276
click the release app now button


1065
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,596
in the top right corner.


1066
00:33:47,346 --> 00:33:49,666
And that's intro pricing and


1067
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,166
pre-orders in a nutshell.


1068
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:54,176
So we have to close out this


1069
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,256
session with a few best


1070
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:57,486
practices from app review.


1071
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,236
These are a few tips that'll


1072
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,396
help your apps to get through


1073
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:01,966
review a little more smoothly.


1074
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:06,616
First, please enter contact


1075
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,436
information and keep it current


1076
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:09,835
throughout the review process.


1077
00:34:10,446 --> 00:34:12,166
Sometimes app review needs to


1078
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,616
reach out to maybe ask a few


1079
00:34:14,616 --> 00:34:16,666
questions to clarify how your


1080
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:17,416
app works.


1081
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:19,806
This will help us to get your


1082
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:20,946
app through review a bit more


1083
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:23,556
quickly, but we can't reach out


1084
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:25,116
to you without contact


1085
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:25,646
information.


1086
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:30,466
Next, please submit demo account


1087
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:32,396
information if your app requires


1088
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:32,976
a log in.


1089
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:35,505
There's a section on the version


1090
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:37,516
page where you can enter this


1091
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:38,826
and keep it updated.


1092
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:41,416
Please make sure the account --


1093
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:42,696
this account information is


1094
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:44,056
current throughout the review


1095
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:44,716
process.


1096
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,466
And if there is a server side to


1097
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:47,936
the log in, which usually there


1098
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,016
is, please make sure that the


1099
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:51,646
server side account is also


1100
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:53,056
enabled throughout the process.


1101
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:57,556
You may be wondering does app


1102
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:58,776
review ever look at the notes?


1103
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:00,356
Well, yes they do.


1104
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:01,796
They look at it with every


1105
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:02,596
single review.


1106
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:04,786
So if there is any information


1107
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,776
that might make it clearer for


1108
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:09,556
app review or maybe tells them


1109
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:11,226
about any kind of non-obvious


1110
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:13,096
features of your app, be sure to


1111
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:14,996
include that information in


1112
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:15,776
these notes.


1113
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:20,056
When you submit screenshots,


1114
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:21,756
please make sure to include


1115
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:23,996
customer experience.


1116
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:26,476
We want to see what the customer


1117
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,266
sees in these screenshots.


1118
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:31,376
And finally, if you're asking


1119
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:33,076
your customers for permissions


1120
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,316
around things like their


1121
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:37,136
location or maybe access to


1122
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,786
their photo library, please


1123
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,156
include, in that permission


1124
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:42,766
modal, why you're requesting


1125
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,016
that information and how it's


1126
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:46,176
going to be used.


1127
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:49,466
And those are a few notes from


1128
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:49,876
app review.


1129
00:35:50,536 --> 00:35:53,006
For more information about


1130
00:35:53,006 --> 00:35:53,926
anything we've talked about


1131
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:55,246
today, please visit this link.


1132
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:57,046
A recording of this video will


1133
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:58,196
be posted there along with


1134
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,586
related documents and other


1135
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:02,976
things, more information about


1136
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:04,086
what we've talked about.


1137
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,156
We also have a few related


1138
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:06,836
sessions.


1139
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:08,306
Tomorrow, as Tommy mentioned, we


1140
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:09,896
have our Automating App Store


1141
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:12,586

1144
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:19,456
you how to use the API at a much


1145
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:20,216
deeper level.


1146
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,886

1147
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:25,286
