[ Background Conversations ]


2
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,216
>> I'm sure many of us here have


3
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:24,086
found ourselves in this


4
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:24,736
situation.


5
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:27,996
You're in the bathtub, and you


6
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,396
come up with an amazing idea for


7
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:29,816
your app.


8
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,146
Or perhaps a little bit less


9
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:34,356
relaxing, you get a text message


10
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:35,676
from someone very important in


11
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:37,256
your organization asking you to


12
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:39,346
come up with amazing ideas for a


13
00:00:39,346 --> 00:00:39,706
new app.


14
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,096
Looks like we are going to be


15
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:42,046
looking at Timers today.


16
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,676
So in those situations, you


17
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:46,126
might tell yourself, "I don't


18
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:46,586
have time."


19
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,296
You might want to dive into X


20
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:49,786
code, start typing out some


21
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,576
Swift, but the problem with that


22
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:52,756
is that once you get committed


23
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:54,576
to code, you're really deep into


24
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,806
how your app is going to work,


25
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,326
and you don't get much leeway to


26
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,856
explore all the alternatives


27
00:00:58,856 --> 00:00:59,366
that you could.


28
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:01,376
Or you might want to dive into


29
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:02,926
Sketch, and draw some really


30
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:03,856
detailed visuals.


31
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:05,986
But again, the problem with that


32
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,606
is that visuals are not


33
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:08,236
interactive.


34
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:09,486
We're building apps.


35
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,616
We want to try it as if it were


36
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:12,056
a real app.


37
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:14,776
So let me show you something I


38
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,896
may build after getting my CEO


39
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:17,666
asking for a Timer.


40
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,556
This is a very basic concept.


41
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,366
I tap to add five seconds to the


42
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:22,796
timer.


43
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:23,626
Let's make it 10.


44
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,546
I press Start, and it starts


45
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:26,546
counting down to zero.


46
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,226
Nothing fancy here, just an idea


47
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:30,716
I had about how the Timer app


48
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,126
might look.


49
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,456
Now, as you might have guessed,


50
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:34,686
from the title of this talk,


51
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,696
this is not a real app.


52
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:39,736
It's a prototype, and it only


53
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,676
took me 60 seconds to build.


54
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,416
That is less time than it took


55
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,396
you to brush your teeth this


56
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,656
morning...hopefully [laughter].


57
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,496
So why do we build prototypes?


58
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:53,656
We build prototypes to test


59
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,236
ideas.


60
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:55,686
Some things that seem really


61
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,446
great might turn out to be not


62
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:58,816
so great once you try it.


63
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:00,796
And some things that don't


64
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:02,116
appear very good at first might


65
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,486
actually have some very valuable


66
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:04,246
insights to them.


67
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,466
This is about saving time and


68
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,926
money by making sure that when


69
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:09,675
you commit to building something


70
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:10,826
by writing code, designing


71
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,306
assets, you're building the


72
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,000
right thing.


73
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,826
We also make prototypes to get


74
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,596
new ideas.


75
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,856
The act of making prototypes and


76
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,506
showing them to people will


77
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,666
bring new insights that will


78
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,646
help make your product even


79
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:22,946
better.


80
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:26,166
Designers love diagrams, so here


81
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,056
is a diagram of what the


82
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:28,186
prototyping process might look


83
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:28,436
like.


84
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,356
We make prototypes, we show them


85
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:33,146
to people, and we learn from the


86
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:33,716
feedback.


87
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:36,456
And we do this over and over and


88
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,846
over again, until we know we're


89
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,036
really making the right thing.


90
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,556
So let's start by making a


91
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,036
prototype.


92
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,556
Who can make prototypes?


93
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:46,526
Everyone. It is about using


94
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:48,086
tools that you already use every


95
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:48,346
day.


96
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:50,726
If you are a developer, you


97
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:53,016
might use X code in Swift, or


98
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,746
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


99
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:57,976
If you are a designer, you might


100
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,626
use Sketch or Illustrator.


101
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:01,986
But even if you don't code or


102
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,086
design, you can build


103
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:03,836
prototypes.


104
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:06,216
You can use keynotes, or your


105
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:07,286
favorite text processor.


106
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,756
It's about subverting your


107
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,146
tools.


108
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,136
Use tools that you use already


109
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:13,756
every day, and push them in new


110
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:14,196
ways.


111
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:16,956
If it can display images, and


112
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,416
respond to user interaction, you


113
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:19,956
can probably build prototypes


114
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:20,396
with it.


115
00:03:20,796 --> 00:03:22,876
So let me show you how I built


116
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:23,696
the prototype we just saw


117
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:25,656
earlier, just using Keynotes, in


118
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,656
under 60 seconds.


119
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,206
Now, the video you're about to


120
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,496
see is a little fast, because I


121
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,466
like to use Keynote a lot for


122
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,896
that kind of stuff, but let me


123
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:32,496
get you through it.


124
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:35,116
So I start by making my document


125
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:36,026
the size of an iPhone.


126
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:37,776
And I'm going to draw the clock


127
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:38,616
face for my timer.


128
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,846
You'll notice I'm not using


129
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,706
really fancy design assets, I'm


130
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,216
just using basic Keynote shapes.


131
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:45,576
Let's do the same thing for the


132
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,716
button, the Start button.


133
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,376
Again, just using a basic


134
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:48,916
Keynote shape.


135
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:50,356
Let's make it green.


136
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,106
And let's make it say Start.


137
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:54,046
Now, I'm adding the hand for my


138
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:54,466
timer.


139
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,526
The trick I'm going to use is in


140
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:58,356
Keynote, when you rotate


141
00:03:58,356 --> 00:03:59,576
objects, they rotate around


142
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:00,136
their center.


143
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,116
So here, you see I am


144
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,976
copy/pasting the hand, moving it


145
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,306
to the lower part, and making it


146
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:04,846
invisible.


147
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,496
Now, I can group them and I can


148
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,856
rotate it and it will look just


149
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:09,926
like a hand on the timer would.


150
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,426
So we make it rotate to the 5


151
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,126
second mark for the first tap,


152
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:15,556
no easing to make it look just


153
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,196
like a real clock, and we add


154
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,526
another animation for the 10


155
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,065
second mark.


156
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,196
And finally, the last animation,


157
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:23,676
which is the hand of the timer


158
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,046
rotating all the way back to the


159
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:25,836
0 second mark.


160
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:29,396
And as this animation starts, we


161
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,566
make the Start button disappear.


162
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:32,496
And that's it.


163
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:33,456
Just like that, we have a


164
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,146
prototype that we can load on an


165
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,876
iPhone, and have it look just


166
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,876
like a real app.


167
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:43,966
[ Applause ]


168
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:45,206
>> So now that we've made a


169
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,116
prototype, we show it to people.


170
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:49,716
As we show it to people, we ask


171
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:51,456
ourselves, how can we make it


172
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:51,896
better?


173
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:54,666
I have some theories about what


174
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,476
will work and what won't, and


175
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:57,906
look for evidence that supports


176
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,076
or contradicts those theories.


177
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,236
Don't argue, defend, or dismiss


178
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,046
the feedback you get.


179
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:04,946
It is also very important to


180
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:06,416
show your prototypes in context,


181
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,266
on the device they're meant for,


182
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,386
in a somewhat realistic


183
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:10,086
situation.


184
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:11,736
You can't test things in a


185
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:12,196
vacuum.


186
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:14,556
So, for example, here I ask my


187
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,256
co-worker to test the pH of a


188
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,586
little bit of water, using the


189
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:17,996
timer.


190
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:20,806
So we add the pH reagent, press


191
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,116
the Start button, and start


192
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,116
shaking the test tube for 10


193
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:23,566
seconds.


194
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,716
So in this case, it seems to


195
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:26,966
work pretty well, right?


196
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,056
Like, it is not a very


197
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,176
complicated use case.


198
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:30,466
Maybe it would be nice to have


199
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,716
the Timer flash, or play a sound


200
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,286
at the end, but it seems to work


201
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:34,696
pretty well.


202
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,386
Now, my friend David used to be


203
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,306
really good at solving the


204
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,846
Rubik's Cube in high school, so


205
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:40,866
I asked him to see if he could


206
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:41,876
still solve a Rubik's Cube in


207
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:42,736
under 10 seconds.


208
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:50,896
All right.


209
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:52,276
Looks like he's still got it,


210
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,556
with time to spare, too


211
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,851
[applause].


212
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:57,556
Now, as David was using this,


213
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:58,456
there are a number of things


214
00:05:58,456 --> 00:05:59,366
that he was telling me.


215
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,726
He found that the Start button


216
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,246
was a little small, and hard to


217
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:02,626
tap.


218
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,726
He also thought it would be nice


219
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:05,656
if there was a countdown when


220
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,946
you press Start, so he could


221
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,246
really position himself on the


222
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,386
Rubik's Cube, and he really


223
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:12,896
wanted to see the actual precise


224
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,126
time, so he could tell if he


225
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,746
beat his record or not.


226
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,176
You see that this opens up a lot


227
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,726
of interesting design questions


228
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,256
around what we're building, and


229
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,036
what it should be like.


230
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,546
Once we've shown our prototypes,


231
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,566
we take a moment to step back


232
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,326
and learn from the feedback that


233
00:06:29,326 --> 00:06:30,386
we have gathered.


234
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:31,916
What is working?


235
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:33,846
What is not working?


236
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:36,016
Do we refine what we have?


237
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:37,966
Or do we try something else


238
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:38,646
altogether?


239
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:40,306
Perhaps do some brainstorming to


240
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:41,346
come up with the next steps?


241
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:44,266
For example, here are some of


242
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,106
the questions that we got as we


243
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,146
showed our prototype.


244
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,226
Do we display the time left on


245
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,236
the timer, or the time elapsed?


246
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,826
How do you pause or stop the


247
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:54,276
timer?


248
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,336
Should we show the time in


249
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:58,316
digital form or analog form, or


250
00:06:58,386 --> 00:06:59,036
maybe both?


251
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:02,286
And are we building a generic


252
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,836
timer, or one for a very


253
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,616
specific purpose, like solving


254
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,356
Rubik's Cubes?


255
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:10,026
And many, many other questions.


256
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,026
Now, the goal isn't to answer


257
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,266
all of those questions, but


258
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,766
rather to know what you don't


259
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:15,946
know, so you can then


260
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:18,456
strategically choose what to


261
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:19,216
pursue next.


262
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:22,326
Here is how I might improve this


263
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:23,486
prototype after showing it.


264
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:25,926
So, David told me that the Start


265
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,126
button was small, and the Clock


266
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,636
was hard to see, so I agree with


267
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:28,876
him.


268
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:29,796
I'm going to make it a nice,


269
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,796
bold red, and let's make the


270
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:33,086
hand white, just so that it


271
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:33,866
really stands out.


272
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,476
Start button is too small, so


273
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:36,166
let's do away with it


274
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,986
altogether, and maybe we make


275
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,036
the entire lower portion of


276
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,246
this, creating a tap region.


277
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:41,796
And let's make it say Start in


278
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,286
nice, bold letters.


279
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:44,746
Same color as the clock to keep


280
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:45,356
it consistent.


281
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:48,226
And I'm going to add a finish


282
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,816
screen for my timer, so we know


283
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:51,506
the timer is done counting down.


284
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,136
So I just add a new slide that


285
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:54,886
we navigate to automatically and


286
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:55,956
have it say Timer Done.


287
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,046
And just like that, we have a


288
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,436
new iteration of our prototype,


289
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,086
that we can build on, and show


290
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:01,466
to people.


291
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:06,066
Making things fast lets you


292
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:07,956
quickly explore a very wide


293
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,696
range of ideas and directions.


294
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,416
Here are some more prototypes


295
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,716
that I built in Keynote around


296
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:13,576
the concept of the Timer.


297
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,036
Now, some of them, as you see,


298
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,626
are aesthetic explorations


299
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,676
around what a Timer might look


300
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:19,926
like, or how you might interact


301
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,756
with it, while others are more


302
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:24,216
specific use cases.


303
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:26,256
Timers for developing film or


304
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,046
cooking a steak.


305
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:29,676
That is also where having a very


306
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,395
diverse team helps your process


307
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:32,765
a lot.


308
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,836
It will let you stumble upon


309
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:35,986
things you never would have on


310
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:36,385
your own.


311
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,635
For example, my co-worker made


312
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:41,086
this Timer to help their child


313
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:41,765
brush their teeth.


314
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:47,126
So we make quick interactive


315
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:47,896
prototypes.


316
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:49,896
We show them to people.


317
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,826
And we learn from the feedback.


318
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,956
And we do this over, and over,


319
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,796
and over again, until we know


320
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:57,836
we're doing the right thing.


321
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,386
If you start by making one


322
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,346
thing, you'll be inspired to


323
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:03,136
make a few others.


324
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:07,896
Some of these things will work


325
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:10,716
really well, and the ideas will


326
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,116
make it mostly unchanged


327
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:12,966
throughout your prototyping


328
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,296
process, and on to your final


329
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:14,726
product.


330
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:16,626
Most things will have some


331
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,116
aspects that work, and others


332
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,006
that don't work as well.


333
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,406
You will be able to take those


334
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,866
and modify them and recombine


335
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:23,406
them in new prototypes that you


336
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,756
can show and explore.


337
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:28,086
And finally, a few things won't


338
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:29,416
work at all, and it is great


339
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,166
when that happens.


340
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:31,116
You've just learned something


341
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,096
very valuable about your app,


342
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,386
and you're not going to be


343
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:36,366
spending designing time or


344
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,756
programming time building things


345
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:38,686
that would not have worked out.


346
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,226
The goal is to take ideas from


347
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,216
your head into the real world,


348
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:47,646
on device, in context, in front


349
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:50,216
of people, as fast as possible.


350
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:54,426
As you are leaving WWDC later


351
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,716
today, here are a few things you


352
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:57,136
can do.


353
00:09:58,516 --> 00:09:59,626
If you don't make prototypes


354
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:00,946
already, the next time you have


355
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:02,516
an idea for an app, or future


356
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,386
for your app, make prototypes.


357
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:05,536
Show them to your colleagues.


358
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:08,396
If you already make prototypes,


359
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:09,386
amazing!


360
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:09,866
Wonderful!


361
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:11,976
Find co-workers who don't, and


362
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:12,946
show them how you do it.


363
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,806
And if you manage a team, make


364
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:16,656
sure that you're building the


365
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:19,436
right thing, by making time for


366
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,726
prototyping as part of your


367
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,576
process and culture.


368
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:24,566
Imagine how wonderful it would


369
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,026
be if the next time you get a


370
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,426
text message like this from your


371
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,386
CEO, you can reply just 60


372
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:30,806
seconds later with a prototype


373
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:31,526
like this.


374
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:32,446
Thank you.


375
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,330
[ Applause ]
