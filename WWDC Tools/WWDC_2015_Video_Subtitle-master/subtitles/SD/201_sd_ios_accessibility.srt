00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:23,116
>> IAN FISCH: Good morning, and
welcome to Accessibility on iOS,


2
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:25,626
my name is Ian Fisch
and I'm an engineer


3
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,056
on the Accessibility team.


4
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:31,866
So accessibility is really
about making sure all users,


5
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,916
regardless of abilities,
have full access to all


6
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,516
of our products and the great
features you put in your apps,


7
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,726
and that means we get to
focus on users and think


8
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:43,686
about how users with these
different abilities use


9
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:44,296
our features.


10
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:47,636
That, in turn, has allowed
Apple to create great futures


11
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:51,336
to empower users, like
the girl you see here


12
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:55,106
with a switch mounted next
to her head which allows her


13
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,646
to control all of iOS,
with just that one button.


14
00:00:57,646 --> 00:01:01,016
And that gives her the
freedom to communicate and play


15
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,756
without the need for assistance.


16
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:07,366
And as users get older
and older, more and more


17
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,696
of them will be using these
accessibility features,


18
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:12,116
so the time is really
now to start thinking


19
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:15,306
about accessibility in
the terms of your app.


20
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:19,806
So Apple creates these great
accessibility features,


21
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:21,376
but that's only part
of the story.


22
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,016
We need all of your
apps to be accessible


23
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:27,146
so we can create a great
ecosystem for accessibility


24
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,426
and empower these users.


25
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:32,276
Today we will be talking about
the accessibility futures


26
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:33,906
that Apple provides on iOS.


27
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:39,416
We will look at what's new
in iOS ,9 and we will go


28
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,166
through what we call
an accessibility audit,


29
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:42,536
where we will look at an app


30
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,376
and see how accessible
it is already.


31
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,236
Then we will go through
implementing some accessibility


32
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:49,226
in that app.


33
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:52,476
But first, let's take a look


34
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:55,376
at the accessibility
features that Apple provides.


35
00:01:56,136 --> 00:02:00,516
We break those into four large
areas: hearing, learning,


36
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:03,626
vision, and physical and motor.


37
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,676
So I will go through just a few
of the features that we have,


38
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:10,985
but there are many more I don't
have time to talk about today.


39
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:13,926
For hearing, we have
made-for-iPhone hearing aids,


40
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:17,296
which allow users to stream
high-quality audio directly


41
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,756
from their iOS device
and control the settings


42
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:20,596
of those hearing aids.


43
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,516
This replaces a lot of extra
hardware the user would have


44
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:25,716
to carry with them
all of the time


45
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:30,486
and provides a much more private
experience for setting these


46
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,246
or changing the settings
for hearing aids.


47
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:37,336
For learning, we have guided
access, which lets teachers,


48
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:41,506
parents, and caregivers remove
distractions so users can focus


49
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:42,966
on a specific app or task.


50
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,476
And we even provide time limits


51
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:49,656
so you can restrict the
time allowed in a task.


52
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:54,056
For developers, we provide
an API that allows you


53
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:57,506
to provide specific
restrictions for your app.


54
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:03,316
For vision, we have
VoiceOver, which lets blind


55
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,306
and low-vision users
touch the screen


56
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,346
and have VoiceOver read
what's under their finger.


57
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,036
So they can use gestures
to interact


58
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:14,356
with the touchscreen even though
they can't see the screen.


59
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,966
We also have Zoom, which lets
users who may need things


60
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,186
to be just a little bit bigger


61
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:25,206
but can see the screen magnify
the interface of your app


62
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:27,476
and the operating system.


63
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:31,066
And it will even
follow text as you type


64
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,686
and leave the keyboard unzoomed


65
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:35,476
so you can still have full
access to the keyboard.


66
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:38,106
Finally for vision, we
have Vision Accommodations,


67
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,086
which adjusts the
interface for users


68
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,966
who might need larger
text, higher contrast,


69
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:46,586
or reduced motion so users can
more easily orient themselves


70
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:47,486
with what's on screen.


71
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,686
For physical and motor,
we have Switch Control,


72
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:54,356
which uses these
switches, or large buttons,


73
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:56,346
to control the operating system.


74
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,296
It's great for users who may
not be able to fully interact


75
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:01,626
with the touchscreen,
and it allows them


76
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:04,076
to sequentially navigate
the items on screen


77
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:07,386
and perform complex
gestures and even play games.


78
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:14,296
If a user has difficulty
performing gestures


79
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,326
or pressing a physical
button, we have AssistiveTouch,


80
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,375
which provides a menu to
quickly access recorded gestures


81
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:21,065
and hardware buttons.


82
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:21,726
And this even works


83
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:24,376
with third-party assistive
devices like wheelchairs.


84
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:29,256
And brand new in iOS 9 we
have Touch Accommodations,


85
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:32,196
which helps users who may have
difficulty performing precise


86
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:35,766
gestures by changing the way the
touchscreen responds to touches,


87
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,766
and I would love to give
you a demo of that now.


88
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,386
Like all accessibility
features, you can turn


89
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:45,086
on Touch Accommodations by
going to Settings, General,


90
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:48,506
Accessibility, and you
can see the large list


91
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:50,106
of accessibility
features we provide.


92
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:53,296
But for now, we will go
into Touch Accommodations.


93
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,416
And you see we have
got three options.


94
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,366
Let's look at Hold Duration.


95
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:02,936
And this allows people
who may have tremors


96
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,526
and touch the screen more than
they would like to set a timeout


97
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:11,126
so not all touches are used.


98
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,536
So let's turn on Hold Duration
and Touch Accommodations.


99
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:17,106
So I go back to the Home
button, you will notice


100
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:20,486
when I put my finger on the
screen I get this timer icon,


101
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:23,116
and if I lift up
before the time is up,


102
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:25,266
the touch isn't passed
to the icon.


103
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:28,456
But if I tap and hold
for the whole duration,


104
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:33,076
it will open the app.


105
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:37,536
So if I have tremors, they
won't be respected as touches.


106
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:41,586
Great! So if we go
back into Settings,


107
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:48,406
we can look at Tap Assistance,
which is great for users


108
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:52,446
who may not be able to land
on exactly the right icon


109
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:53,456
that they are looking for.


110
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,256
So if we go back
to the Home screen,


111
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:02,306
you can see that if I press on
Clock and then move to Calendar,


112
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:05,956
the touch will be passed to
Calendar instead of Clock.


113
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,966
So it's the final touch
location that's respected.


114
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:18,256
And that's Touch
Accommodations on iOS 9.


115
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:22,256
So, many of these accessibility
features rely on UIAccessibility


116
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:25,196
to bridge the gap between
the assistive technology


117
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:26,246
and your app.


118
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,646
For instance, if a VoiceOver
user taps on the screen,


119
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:33,256
it will look for the
element under their finger


120
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,706
and ask the element in your app
for its accessibility label.


121
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:40,736
So when you return the string
Weather, VoiceOver will speak:


122
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:41,836
>> VOICEOVER: Weather.


123
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:46,036
>> IAN FISCH: And similarly
with Switch Control,


124
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:49,536
the Switch Control user
brings up the menu on one


125
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:51,406
of your elements,
will ask that element


126
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,626
for its accessibility
custom actions,


127
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,836
and when you return the
actions -- move, pass and trade,


128
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:57,916
if it's a game app, maybe --


129
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,246
it will display those in
the Switch Control menu


130
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:03,766
so users have fast
access to these actions


131
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,256
on elements in your app.


132
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:09,586
So you will notice that
UIAccessibility is really


133
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,916
about asking questions
of elements in your app


134
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:15,226
so the assistive technology
knows how to work with it.


135
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,616
So let's go through a
few of those questions.


136
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:19,936
The first one is: Do
I serve a purpose?


137
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,336
This is really about
whether an element is useful


138
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:25,656
or important to the user.


139
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:28,196
So a line that separates
elements


140
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:29,806
in a view is very
important visually,


141
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,846
but since the user
can't interact with it


142
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:34,736
and it doesn't provide
information like a UI label,


143
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,726
it's not really serving
a purpose.


144
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,916
So we answer this question
with Is Accessibility Element.


145
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:45,496
If we look at the Plus button
in Clock, it's a button,


146
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:46,946
the user can interact with it,


147
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,986
and so for that we
would return True.


148
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:53,526
The next most important
question is: What's my name?


149
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:56,146
We answer that with
Accessibility Label.


150
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,976
This is what VoiceOver
uses to read


151
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,606
to the user what's
under their finger.


152
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:05,586
If we look at the Plus
button, you might be tempted


153
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,386
to set the label to something
like Button To Add A Clock,


154
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:12,216
which is a great description
of what the button will do,


155
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:14,726
but you should think of the
accessibility label more


156
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:16,626
like the title of a button,


157
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,366
so a better accessibility
label would just be Add.


158
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:25,986
So what's the personality
of the element in your app?


159
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:29,566
And this is really about
describing to the user


160
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,696
and the assistive technology
how they can interact


161
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,275
with an element.


162
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,696
So we answer that with
Accessibility Traits.


163
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:38,905
So we have a whole host
of traits that you can set


164
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:42,056
on elements that describe
how to interact with them.


165
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:46,076
So if we look at the Plus
or Add button in Clock,


166
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,476
we would set the trait to
Button, because it's a button,


167
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:52,026
and VoiceOver would read
it as a button to the user.


168
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,306
Next question is:
What's my value?


169
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,666
So if an element has a state
that changes frequently


170
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,506
over its life, we would
change that or update


171
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,636
that with Accessibility Value.


172
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,926
So if this time we look
at the Clock element,


173
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:10,186
the value that changes
would be the time,


174
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:15,156
and so we would return the
string 11:20 a.m. and update


175
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,626
that accordingly as
the time changes.


176
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:21,936
So the next question is: How
should people interact with me?


177
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,496
If the traits aren't enough
to describe how to interact


178
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:28,306
with an element, where you
need just a little bit more


179
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:31,466
information, you can provide
that with Accessibility Hint.


180
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:35,306
So if we look at the
grabber in World Clock,


181
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:37,946
we could set the hint to
something like, drag up


182
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:39,136
or down to change the order.


183
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,406
And this is, this describes


184
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,326
to the user exactly how
they can interact with it,


185
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:47,706
just a short description
of how to use it.


186
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,396
And finally: Where am I?


187
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,556
You may have noticed
that Switch Control


188
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:54,866
and VoiceOver have cursors
that move around the screen.


189
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:57,476
So we need to know where
to display that cursor.


190
00:09:58,036 --> 00:10:00,026
So we answer that with
Accessibility Frame.


191
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,766
And that's how we draw the
beautiful cursor we see here.


192
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:07,356
It's important to
remember that the frame is


193
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,696
in screen coordinates, so
we provide a helper method


194
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,536
to convert from view
to screen coordinates.


195
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:16,106
Most of the time we assume this
to just be the frame of a view,


196
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,846
so you won't need to touch
this unless you need it


197
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,776
to be something a
little bit more specific.


198
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,526
And that's it!


199
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:28,756
Those six methods make up the
basic API for UI accessibility,


200
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,646
and that's enough to get
most of accessibility done,


201
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:34,926
so just a few lines of
code and a few minutes


202
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,706
to make your app
really accessible.


203
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:41,536
But the really great news
is we do most of the work.


204
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,716
So if you use standard
controls in UIKit,


205
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,476
most of this is done for you.


206
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,656
If you do custom drawing,


207
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,976
we need you to answer
these questions for us


208
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:54,456
so accessibility users can know
how to interact with your app.


209
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,136
So just that really
small investment


210
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,266
of those six methods will
give you a large reward


211
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,286
of a lot more people being
able to use your app.


212
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:06,776
So it's not that much to
make something accessible.


213
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:11,586
So now your convinced:
accessibility, just six methods,


214
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,886
that's easy, how do I do it?


215
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,706
The first step is
design for accessibility.


216
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,956
So when you are thinking
about your app and thinking


217
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:22,796
about how users will use
the app you are building,


218
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:24,866
think about Switch
Control and VoiceOver users


219
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,346
and how they will
interact with your app.


220
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,076
But if you have an app already,
like we assume most of you do,


221
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,836
the best way to start is
do an audit of your app


222
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,886
and see how accessible it is
already, because, like I said,


223
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,226
if you use UIKit
standard controls,


224
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,666
most of this should
be done already.


225
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,476
There are a few ways to
do an accessibility audit.


226
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,216
The first one is the
accessibility inspector


227
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:49,816
in the simulator.


228
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:52,586
And you turn that on by
going to Settings, General,


229
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:56,036
Accessibility, and
turning on the inspector,


230
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,636
and you will notice that it
brings up this beautiful window


231
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:01,206
that answers those six questions
we have been talking about.


232
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,066
So you can quickly spot check
the elements in your app


233
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:06,796
and make sure they are
responding as you expect.


234
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:11,676
The best way to check
for accessibility is


235
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,306
to use the accessibility
features on the device,


236
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,396
like VoiceOver and
Switch Control.


237
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,746
And I would love to
do that with you now.


238
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:24,296
So back in Settings, we can turn
on VoiceOver by going to the top


239
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:28,366
of Accessibility Settings, but
I would recommend if you are new


240
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:33,136
to VoiceOver to come down to the
Accessibility shortcut and turn


241
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:36,276
on VoiceOver, so that way you
can tap the Home button three


242
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,236
times anywhere in
the operating system


243
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:39,666
to turn VoiceOver on and off.


244
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,406
So if we go back
to the Home screen,


245
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:46,546
I will tap the Home
button three times.


246
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:51,536
There is VoiceOver telling
us it's on Messages,


247
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:53,856
so I will take one finger
and move it around the screen


248
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,546
and VoiceOver will read
what's under my finger.


249
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:59,606
>> VOICEOVER: weather, clock,
map, videos, wallet, stocks,


250
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,266
reminders, two tasks due today.


251
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:03,026
Double-tap to open.


252
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,826
>> IAN FISCH: I have a few
more things to do today.


253
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:06,276
All right.


254
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:08,576
So if I take one
finger and swipe right,


255
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:09,686
it will move to the
next element.


256
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,066
>> VOICEOVER: Stocks,
double-tap to open.


257
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:15,306
>> IAN FISCH: Tell me about
stocks, and if I take one finger


258
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:21,696
and slide to the left, it will
move to the previous element.


259
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:25,706
So double-tap with one finger
will activate an element,


260
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:27,316
so it will bring up Reminders.


261
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:31,226
And then the only other gesture


262
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:37,126
that you will need is a
three-finger gesture to scroll,


263
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:41,526
so I will take three fingers
and scroll to the next,


264
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:43,966
and previous, element,
and that's it.


265
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:47,526
Just the few gestures will
control VoiceOver and allow you


266
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,856
to check your app
for accessibility.


267
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:53,886
Let's take a look at Clock and
check it for accessibility.


268
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:56,946
>> VOICEOVER: Clock, 9:15
a.m. Double tap to open.


269
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:58,166
>> IAN FISCH: Double
tap to open.


270
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:59,716
>> VOICEOVER: Clock,
edit, button.


271
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:02,586
>> IAN FISCH: When you are doing
an audit, you want to check


272
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:05,516
that everything has an
accessibility label,


273
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:06,866
it has a meaningful value.


274
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:10,936
If its state changes, you want
to swipe through the elements


275
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:12,756
and make sure that
the order makes sense


276
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,146
so that it's moving
from, generally,


277
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:17,986
top left to bottom right if you
are in a left-to-right language


278
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,666
and the reverse if you
are in a right-to-left.


279
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,956
So let's swipe through
and listen


280
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:24,116
to what VoiceOver
finds in this app.


281
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:29,246
>> VOICEOVER: World clock,
heading, Cupertino, today,


282
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:32,876
9:16 a.m. Swipe up or down
to select a custom action,


283
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:34,096
then double-tap to activate.


284
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:37,076
>> IAN FISCH: So VoiceOver
is telling us the label


285
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,306
and the value.


286
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,866
>> VOICEOVER: Selected,
world clock, tap.


287
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:43,866
>> IAN FISCH: This has
the Selected trait.


288
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,036
So that's another
trait you can add.


289
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:48,866
It tells us that there is three
more elements in the tab bar.


290
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:50,776
>> VOICEOVER: Alarm, tab.


291
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:52,396
Stopwatch, tab.


292
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:53,706
Timer, tab.


293
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:54,446
Four of four.


294
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:58,526
>> IAN FISCH: So I can swipe
to everything in World Clock,


295
00:14:58,526 --> 00:14:59,506
or at least on this screen,


296
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:02,226
everything has a label,
a meaningful value.


297
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:03,486
The traits are set properly.


298
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,416
So this looks pretty
accessible, that's good.


299
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,146
So I will turn off
VoiceOver now.


300
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:09,226
>> VOICEOVER: Voiceover off.


301
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:11,046
>> IAN FISCH: Let's
look at an app


302
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,046
that I brought called
QuakeWatch.


303
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:17,366
I'm from the Bay Area,
which means I'm obsessed


304
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:21,166
with earthquakes, so I wrote an
app that will track earthquakes


305
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,046
as they happen in real
time around the world.


306
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:25,666
Great for a native like me.


307
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,786
So you can see that
earthquakes are happening


308
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,656
or have happened recently.


309
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:33,846
And it will tell you where it
happened, when it happened,


310
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:38,236
and the text color tells you
the magnitude of the earthquake,


311
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:39,386
and we even get a
little map view.


312
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:43,606
So if I tap in, I can look


313
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,216
at the earthquake on
a map, I zoom out.


314
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:50,556
I should be able to find other
earthquakes, and I can tap


315
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:52,986
to get more information
about the earthquake.


316
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,556
There is even an Info button
that will take me to USGS


317
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,916
and give me even
more information.


318
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:04,746
I can tap and hold on a set
of earthquakes to add them


319
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,116
to my favorite list
and even compare them.


320
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:08,826
Pretty cool app!


321
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,246
Best earthquake app
I have ever seen.


322
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,266
So if I triple-tap
with VoiceOver,


323
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:19,666
let's see what the VoiceOver
user would see with this app.


324
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:20,556
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on,


325
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,646
QuakeWatch, earthquakes,
heading.


326
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:25,256
>> IAN FISCH: Earthquakes,
heading, so far so good.


327
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:26,366
>> VOICEOVER: Favorites, button.


328
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:29,116
>> IAN FISCH: Favorites,
button, that's pretty good.


329
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,806
So these are standard
UIKit controls,


330
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:32,636
so I get them for free.


331
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:33,466
That's great.


332
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:37,646
Now, I will take my one
finger and slide around


333
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:40,446
and see what we find
with the cells.


334
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:44,576
[Tapping noise]


335
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:49,146
So that sound you are hearing
is VoiceOver telling you


336
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:52,976
that it can't find anything
to touch under that finger,


337
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:55,216
so the cells aren't accessible.


338
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:56,116
That's no good.


339
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,396
Let's go into the
favorites, look at that graph.


340
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:04,556
[Tapping noise]


341
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,626
>> IAN FISCH: It looks like the
graph isn't accessible either.


342
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:11,026
That's unfortunate,
such a beautiful graph.


343
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:15,425
So there is one more
gesture that might help you


344
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,906
as you are looking at your app,
if you do a double tap and hold,


345
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:22,366
VoiceOver will pass through
the touch and just push it


346
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,396
through to whatever
is under your finger.


347
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:27,056
So even though the
cell isn't accessible,


348
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:29,046
we can jump in and --


349
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,586
>> VOICEOVER: Earthquake,
shows more info, detail.


350
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,166
>> IAN FISCH: Get to the view.


351
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,306
>> VOICEOVER: Detail,
earthquakes, back button.


352
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:35,656
Earthquake.


353
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,686
Show more info.


354
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:43,556
Use the rotor to access
points of interest.


355
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:43,706
>> IAN FISCH: All right.


356
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:43,876
Nice.


357
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:47,096
>> VOICEOVER: Earthquake,
location, 74 kilometers,


358
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:51,446
felt by zero people,
magnitude 1.50.


359
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:53,556
Dismiss pop up.


360
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:55,156
Double-tap to --


361
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:58,136
>> IAN FISCH: It looks like the
Info button isn't accessible,


362
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,516
so VoiceOver just
doesn't see it.


363
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:04,556
So it's not very accessible
to a VoiceOver user.


364
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:06,406
They can't really get to
any of the information,


365
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,146
so it's mostly useless.


366
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,436
Let's turn off VoiceOver.


367
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:14,326
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver off.


368
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:18,656
>> IAN FISCH: So
what did we find


369
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,316
with our accessibility audit?


370
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:26,826
We have got that earthquake
cell that just isn't accessible,


371
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,496
VoiceOver couldn't
see it at all,


372
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:33,406
and the text color is
communicating magnitude,


373
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:36,216
which isn't a great way
to communicate magnitude


374
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,756
because not everyone
can see all colors


375
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:41,486
and it's also just really
ugly and difficult to read,


376
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,246
as you can see with
the yellow here.


377
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,176
There is that map detail
view, where the labels need


378
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:50,316
to be a little more
specific about their purpose.


379
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:54,016
And that Info button
is completely invisible


380
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:54,826
to VoiceOver users.


381
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:57,616
So that's no good.


382
00:18:58,256 --> 00:19:00,836
But the great news is those six
methods we have been talking


383
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:03,526
about so far are enough
to fix all of these issues


384
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,216
with just a few lines of
code in a few minutes.


385
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:09,206
So let's do that together now.


386
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:10,386
All right.


387
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:15,746
So here is QuakeWatch and
the first thing we will look


388
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:17,736
at is that earthquake cell.


389
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,536
The earthquake cell is
written in Swift and the rest


390
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,586
of the p roject is
in Objective-C,


391
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:29,176
so accessibility works
in both languages


392
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,186
and it can coexist just
like the rest of your code.


393
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:34,226
So let's see.


394
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:35,886
It's not accessible.


395
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,876
If we look down, we can see


396
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:42,346
that the reason it's not
accessible is I'm taking a


397
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,136
string and drawing
it at a point.


398
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:48,566
So if I used UI labels instead,
this would be accessible for me,


399
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,146
but because I'm drawing
the strings directly


400
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,836
into the view, it's
not accessible.


401
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:58,546
And then I'm grabbing
the alert color and using


402
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:01,656
that as the text color
for all of these strings.


403
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:05,416
So the first thing we
should do is get rid of that


404
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,696
and instead use UI
color black color.


405
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:10,636
Now, we will all
be able to read it.


406
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:11,316
Won't that be great?


407
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:17,256
And now that we aren't using
that for the magnitude,


408
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,596
let's just keep up with that
trend and add a magnitude string


409
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,716
that we draw directly
to the view.


410
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:25,386
Why not? All right.


411
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,316
So that will take care
of the text color.


412
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:30,676
How do we make it accessible?


413
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:34,266
If we come up here to where we
set the earthquake on the cell,


414
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:41,386
we can grab the date that
the earthquake happened,


415
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,976
and a handy event
description that will tell us


416
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,946
where it happened, and format
it correctly, obviously.


417
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:51,446
We will set Is Accessibility
Element to True on the cell


418
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,136
so VoiceOver will
be able to find it,


419
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,476
and then we will set the label


420
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:57,126
to the description
we just built.


421
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:58,866
Okay. Great!


422
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,986
The only other thing
we might want


423
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:03,776
to add is a value
for that favorite.


424
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,166
When you add something
to a favorites list,


425
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:08,036
obviously a VoiceOver user
would want to know that.


426
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:12,436
Down here where we
toggle the favorite,


427
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:17,326
we can add a little bit of code


428
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,686
that sets the accessibility
value


429
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:23,086
to Favorite if it's a favorite.


430
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,146
So let's take a look
at the popover view.


431
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:30,446
I happen to know it's here.


432
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:35,716
So it looks like that button
is actually a UI control,


433
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:38,256
which would explain why
it's not accessible.


434
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:41,776
If I had used a UI button,
this would be accessible


435
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:44,306
from the start, but we
need a little bit of help


436
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:45,496
to make it accessible.


437
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,826
So let's do that now.


438
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:54,786
So we will take the More Info
button, set Is Accessibility


439
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:58,716
to Yes, add the Button trait,
and then we'll set the label


440
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:01,316
to More Info and the
hint to Double-Tap


441
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:02,276
To View More Information.


442
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:04,916
And obviously you would
want to localize this,


443
00:22:05,466 --> 00:22:08,496
but for now we will
leave it this way.


444
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:15,846
The only other thing we want to
do here is set the Header trait


445
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:19,256
on the location and felt
header, so it's clear what's


446
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:22,416
in that view and
what information is


447
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,106
being communicated.


448
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:28,076
That was just a few minutes
of work, and that should clean


449
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,146
up quite a few issues.


450
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,866
Let's build and check it out.


451
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:34,196
All right.


452
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,446
Let's triple-tap home to
turn VoiceOver back on.


453
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,226
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.


454
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:41,966
FaceTime, QuakeWatch,
double-tap to open,


455
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:44,456
QuakeWatch, earthquakes,

456
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,746
>> IAN FISCH: The first
thing you notice is


457
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,836
that ugly yellow
color is finally gone.


458
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:50,826
Thank goodness!


459
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:55,036
So let's swipe around with one
finger and see what happens.


460
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,666
>> VOICEOVER: Favorites,
button, 12 kilometers,


461
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:02,436
Oklahoma, 2015, 10:57 a.m.


462
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:04,236
>> IAN FISCH: So earthquake
finds the cell now.


463
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:10,716
That's good if we come
to the detail view.


464
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,566
>> VOICEOVER: Dismiss
earthquake, location, heading.


465
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:16,996
>> IAN FISCH: Location
now has the heading trait,


466
00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:18,506
so it's clear what's
happening in the view.


467
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,096
>> VOICEOVER: 12 kilometers.


468

00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:27,836
Double-tap to view
more information.


472
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:29,606
>> IAN FISCH: The More Info
button is now accessible


473
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:34,036
and tells us how to use
it and what it will do.


474
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,566
Great! Just a few lines of
code and we were able to clean


475
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,776
up the app and make
it pretty accessible.


476
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:40,386
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver off.


477
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:43,456
>> IAN FISCH: So where
did we get so far?


478
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:45,516
The earthquake cell
is now accessible,


479
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:46,626
we are not communicating
anything


480
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,976
with text color anymore,
which is really great,


481
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,656
that ugly yellow
is finally gone.


482
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,576
The map detail view now
has meaningful traits


483
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:55,016
on those labels so it's clear


484
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,446
to the VoiceOver user what's
happening and they can navigate


485
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:58,446
by headings if they like.


486
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,836
That Info button it accessible.


487
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:05,286
We still need a way to add
something to the favorite list,


488
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,366
and the favorite graph
is still inaccessible.


489
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:14,566
How would we make
this graph accessible?


490
00:24:15,596 --> 00:24:17,916
So let's start by going back


491
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,706
to those questions we were
talking about earlier.


492
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,476
The first one was:
Do I serve a purpose?


493
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:24,666
So there is a lot of
information being communicated


494
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:29,016
in this graph, but not all of
it is really serving a purpose


495
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,186
or really important to the user.


496
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,226
So what's the most
important bits in this graph?


497
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:34,366
I think that's the points,


498
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:36,876
because they tell us exactly
what we are comparing,


499
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:39,376
so that's probably what
we should make accessible.


500
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:43,316
The next question that's worth
talking about is: Where am I?


501
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:45,866
So what do we set for
the accessibility frame


502
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,656
for these points?


503
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,596
So you might think
that the orange boxes


504
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:55,696
that you see now are a
good idea, but if you look


505
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:59,066
at the view as a whole,
most of it isn't accessible.


506
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:03,806
So most of it is
just dead space,


507
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:06,846
and so as a VoiceOver
user slides their finger


508
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,526
around the screen to search for
points, it will be mostly empty.


509
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:13,456
A better frame might
be something like this.


510
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,626
So a VoiceOver user can
slide his or her finger


511
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,416
across the screen,
and they will hit all


512
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,496
of the points as they do so.


513
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:22,316
And then as long as we set
the accessibility value


514
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:24,616
to the magnitude, we
haven't lost anything.


515
00:25:24,616 --> 00:25:26,446
We haven't lost any information.


516
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:28,556
So that seems like a good plan.


517
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,896
Unfortunately, I happen to know


518
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,976
that the graph view
is just one big view,


519
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:36,296
and everything is drawn
directly into the view.


520
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:42,056
So how do we make one view
accessible into multiple parts?


521
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:45,406
And the good news is we have
got an API for that as well,


522
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:47,176
UIAccessibility element.


523
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:51,286
So this is a great way to
create specific objects just


524
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:54,416
for accessibility to break
up a view into subelements


525
00:25:54,816 --> 00:25:57,186
and still answer those great
six questions we have been


526
00:25:57,186 --> 00:25:57,826
talking about.


527
00:25:58,486 --> 00:26:01,266
The only new part is the
accessibility container,


528
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,136
which you would just set
to the containing view.


529
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:07,616
Great! So with this API, we
can make the graph accessible.


530
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,506
How do we add something
to that favorite list


531
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,686
so there is something
to display on the graph?


532
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:17,036
For that I think we should use
Accessibility Perform Magic Tap,


533
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:18,716
which is this really cool API


534
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:21,626
to just do the right thing
in the right context.


535
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,436
A good example of that is


536
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,096
when a VoiceOver user
gets a phone call,


537
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:29,666
they can do the Magic Tap
gesture, which is two fingers,


538
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,776
double-tap on the screen, and
that will do the magic thing,


539
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:34,576
which is answer the phone call.


540
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:38,496
So that will allow us to add
something to the favorite list,


541
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:41,376
but what do we add to the list?


542
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:44,046
And for that we can
use some brand-new API


543
00:26:44,206 --> 00:26:46,846
in iOS 9 called Accessibility
Focus.


544
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:50,256
This will allow you to get
the currently focused element


545
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:51,956
for a given assistive technology


546
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:53,726
like VoiceOver or
Switch Control.


547
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:56,486
If you are interested in
tracking focus as it moves


548
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:59,196
around your app, we
provide a notification


549
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:02,216
that will tell you the
currently focused element


550
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:03,706
and the previously
focused element


551
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,086
for a given assistive
technology.


552
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,356
We know what to add
to the favorites list,


553
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:11,186
we know how to add it, and
then we can explore the graph.


554
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,596
So let's look at
implementing that now.


555
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:20,546
All right.


556
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:22,036
Back in Xcode.


557
00:27:23,096 --> 00:27:26,986
So let's add something
to the favorite list.


558
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,576
So if we go to the app delegate,


559
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:35,956
we can add Accessibility
Perform Magic Tap.


560
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:39,526
So we will grab the currently
focused element for VoiceOver,


561
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:43,246
check if that element
responds to toggle favorite,


562
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,286
like the cell, and if it
does, we will ask it to toggle


563
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:47,696
as favorite and then return Yes.


564
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:49,506
Otherwise, we return No,


565
00:27:49,946 --> 00:27:52,416
and VoiceOver will do the
next-most-magical thing


566
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:54,356
in that context,
whatever that may be.


567
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:59,186
So that will allow us to add
something to the favorite list.


568
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,456
Now, let's look at the graph.


569
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,716
All right.


570
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:07,096
So it looks like I'm
drawing it with CAShapeLayer,


571
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,526
which is a great way to draw
a graph, but not a great way


572
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:11,586
to draw an accessible graph.


573
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:15,456
So down here I'm actually
grabbing the point


574
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:16,966
and drawing it.


575
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,056
So that seems like a good place


576
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:22,366
to create my UIAccessibility
element.


577
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:28,376
So I create a UIAccessibility
element, setting its container


578
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:30,096
to Self, the graph view.


579
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:35,186
And then I set its label to a
formatted version of the date.


580
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,336
So we know when it happened.


581
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,456
We will set the value to
the magnitude description.


582
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,146
That's good.


583
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:45,976
And then like we talked about,
I will take the frame and set it


584
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:49,216
to slightly wider
than the point,


585
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:51,756
and the full height
of the graph.


586
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:56,226
I will set that as the
frame after converting it


587
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,676
to screen coordinates.


588
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,576
And finally add that to
an array that I had ready,


589
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,396
and set that as the
accessibility elements


590
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:07,436
for the graph view.


591
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,396
So just a few more
lines of code.


592
00:29:10,936 --> 00:29:12,976
Let's see what that looks like.


593
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:19,066
All right.


594
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:22,066
So I will triple-tap
Home and start VoiceOver.


595
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:22,816
>> VOICEOVER: VoiceOver on.


596
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,096
FaceTime, QuakeWatch.


597
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:26,826
Double-tap to open.


598
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:27,316
QuakeWatch.


599
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:28,646
Earthquakes, heading.


600
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,086
>> IAN FISCH: There's
those beautiful cells.


601
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:33,386
I will do the Magic Tap
gesture, which is two fingers,


602
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:34,566
double-tap on the screen.


603
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:39,196
And there it is,
now it's a favorite.


604
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,476
>> VOICEOVER: 12 kilometers.


605
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:43,926
California 2015.


606
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:46,116
11:10 a.m. Favorite.


607
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:47,546
>> IAN FISCH: It
says it's a favorite.


608
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:48,586
That's good.


609
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,026
So let's add a few more.


610
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,196
First, we have to wait
for earthquakes to happen.


611
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:55,186
All right.


612
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:57,786
Three should be enough.


613
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:00,206
>> VOICEOVER: Detail,
back button.


614
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,366
>> IAN FISCH: Let's
see what happens


615
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:04,806
when we swipe around the graph.


616
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:11,416
>> VOICEOVER: 2005, 2/5, 2015.


617
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,286
Pacific Time.


618
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,086
Magnitude 0.43.


619
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:16,276
>> IAN FISCH: As I
slide my finger across,


620
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:19,856
I should hit all of them.


621
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:23,486
And that's how you make
a graphic accessible,


622
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:24,976
an earthquake graph
accessible, at least.


623
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:27,836
So just a few lines of
code, and we were able


624
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:32,306
to clean all of that up.


625
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:33,786
Let's take one more look,


626
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:35,996
we have the earthquake
cell is now accessible,


627
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:37,596
not using yellow
anymore, thank goodness.


628
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:40,156
The map detail is accessible.


629
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:43,186
We can add a favorite
using the Magic Tap,


630
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:47,256
and we can even explore the
graph and compare earthquakes,


631
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,256
our favorite earthquakes,
at least.


632
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,826
So just a few lines of
code, just a few minutes,


633
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:55,816
and we were able to take an app
that was completely unusable


634
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:59,526
for VoiceOver users and make
it probably the most accessible


635
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,496
earthquake tracking
app out there.


636
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:08,156
Remember that accessibility
is about users.


637
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:09,896
Thinking about how users


638
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,926
of all abilities will
interact with your app.


639
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,776
Remember everyone that's
going to be using your app


640
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:16,686
as you are designing it.


641
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:18,666
Apple has been embracing
accessibility


642
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,886
for so long that's
it's expected of us


643
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:24,176
that we are fully accessible
with all of the products


644
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,116
and features that we release.


645
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:30,586
And we really strive hard
to make that possible.


646
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:33,486
We would like to invite you
to join us in that endeavor


647
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:37,016
and make the ecosystem as
a whole really accessible.


648
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,236
If you would like more
information, you can search


649
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:42,836
for UIAccessibility
on developer.apple


650
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,396
or check the developer forums.


651
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:47,736
We also have an Apple
Watch session later today


652
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:51,166
and an Accessibility and
Speech Lab right after that.


653
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:52,596
So you can bring your app,


654
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,866
and we will help you
make certain parts


655
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:56,806
of your app accessible,
or you can just sit


656
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:59,836
with an accessibility expert and
go through an audit of your app


657
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,566
and see how accessible
it is already.


658
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:04,126
So we look forward to
seeing everyone there.


659
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:06,836
Thanks, have a great conference.


660
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,508
[Applause]
