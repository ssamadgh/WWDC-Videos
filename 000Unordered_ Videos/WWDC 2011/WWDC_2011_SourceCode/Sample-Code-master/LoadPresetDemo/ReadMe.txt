### LoadPresetDemo ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This app shows how to create an AUGraph object containing a Sampler unit, 
configure the Sampler by loading one of the two included AUPreset files, 
and then start the graph and trigger note-on and note-off events to 
audition the presets. The preset files were created in Mac OS X using the 
AU Lab application, found in /Developer/Applications/Audio.

To use this app, tap the Play Low, Play Mid, and Play High buttons (which 
constitute a rudimentary keyboard) to audition the current preset. You can 
play more than one note simultaneously. Tap the "Trombone" or the 
"Vibraphone" button to load the corresponding patch, which employs the 
like-named .aupreset file.

In addition to studying the source files to see how this app works, look at 
the connections established in the MainViewController nib file to see how
the play buttons communicate with the MainViewController object.

To learn how the preset files used in this sample code project were 
created using AU Lab in Mac OS X, view the Music in iOS and Lion 
presentation from WWDC 2011, and in particular the section on the Sampler 
audio unit. <https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2011/?id=411>
