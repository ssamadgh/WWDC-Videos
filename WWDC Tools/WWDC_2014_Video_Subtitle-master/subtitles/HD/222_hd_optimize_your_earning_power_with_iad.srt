1
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:14,656
>> OK. Hello everybody.


2
00:00:14,786 --> 00:00:16,315
My name is Dave Wilson.


3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,986
I'm on the iAd team, and
I'm here to talk to you


4
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:21,556
about optimizing your
earning power with iAd.


5
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,916
For those of you who
don't know somehow,


6
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:29,276
iAd is Apple's digital
advertising platform.


7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,466
This is what's used -
you may have seen it


8
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,326
in other apps you've
used on iOS.


9
00:00:33,676 --> 00:00:35,836
If you use iTunes Radio at
all, the ads that you see


10
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,426
in iTunes Radio are
driven by iAd.


11
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,066
So that's what iAd is.


12
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:42,646
There's two parts to
this presentation.


13
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:44,946
We're going to be talking
first about monetization:


14
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,126
how you can use iAd
inside your apps


15
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:49,576
to drive revenue for your apps.


16
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,936
And the second part is
promotion: how you can use iAd


17
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,296
to get more downloads of
your app to get more users


18
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,546
of your app - to get your app
out in everyone else's hands.


19
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,986
So let's start off
with monetization.


20
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:03,806
I'm going to start off


21
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:05,826
with a few different pieces
we're going to talk about here.


22
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:07,966
Talk about some developer
benefits,


23
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,626
what iAd can do for you.


24
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:14,146
Talk about some core concepts,
sort of an advertising 101.


25
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,186
We'll talk about improving
performance, how you can sort


26
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,666
of best use iAd and
get the most out of it.


27
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:22,956
We'll talk some details about
the actual code you have


28
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:24,706
to write to integrate
iAd inside your app,


29
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:26,586
which is fortunately
pretty simple.


30
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,656
We'll talk a little
bit about testing iAd


31
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,076
and making sure your integration
is actually working before you


32
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:32,606
get out in the App Store
and then just get bugs


33
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:37,366
So let's start off with
developer benefits.


34
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:44,326
First of all, iAd provides
rich, engaging ads.


35
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:49,856
This is a platform that
values great ads to go


36
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,986
into the great apps
that you create.


37
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,506
They're high production values.


38
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,966
There's rich media apps,


39
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,776
and there's rich media
ads involved here.


40
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,596
These are things
that involve video.


41
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:03,756
They involve animations.


42
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,266
They're immersive.


43
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:10,116
These are sometimes entire
games presented inside ads.


44
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,926
There was an Intel ad recently


45
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:14,866
that was literally a game
once the users tapped on it.


46
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:15,936
This is the other things


47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,336
that your users are actually
interested in engaging on,


48
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,836
interested in tapping on,
which is great for you


49
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:23,556
as a potential advertising
publisher here.


50
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,806
These are award-winning ads.


51
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:30,946
These are not just fly by
night, you know, one off apps -


52
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:33,376
or ads with link tags
in them that are going


53
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:34,596
to annoy the heck
out of your users.


54
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,476
These are carefully crafted ads


55
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:39,286
that actually look good
as part of your app.


56
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:44,536
OK? In addition, Apple
is providing this SDK.


57
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:49,686
As a result, the same care
that Apple takes with respect


58
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:53,966
to privacy and power efficiency
on the rest of Apple's system,


59
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,436
Apple invests in iAd as well.


60
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:00,556
That means that we take
care of all of the power


61
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,166
and privacy considerations
for you


62
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,596
so you don't have
to worry about them.


63
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:05,546
You don't need to worry


64
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,876
about obeying the limit
ad tracking switch.


65
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:10,026
You don't need to obey
about - don't need to worry


66
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:13,346
about location permissions
or making sure


67
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:15,506
that your users' privacy


68
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,596
and personal data is
protected properly.


69
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,056
In addition, because this
is an Apple-provided SDK,


70
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:26,556
it's part of the iOS SDK.


71
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:27,606
Integration is simple.


72
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:29,726
There's nothing else to install.


73
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:32,036
There are no static
libraries to include.


74
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,766
There's no third-party
headers to drop


75
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,146
into your project to
clutter things up.


76
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,606
It's all there to begin with.


77
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,136
You can be up and
running with minimal code.


78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,756
As we're going to see later,
it's about two lines of code


79
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,706
to get banners in your app.


80
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:49,106
In addition, along with the
rest of the code that other -


81
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,636
along with the rest of the
SDK that Apple provides,


82
00:03:51,636 --> 00:03:54,096
there's great documentation
and great sample code available


83
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:56,096
to you on the websites.


84
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:59,436
iAd has global reach.


85
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:00,786
We're in 14 countries now.


86
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,486
We're constantly expanding.


87
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:03,816
This a larger list of countries


88
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:05,086
than we showed up
here last year.


89
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:08,786
And that means that you're
going to get ads in all


90
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:10,516
of those countries
inside your app.


91
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,186
So as soon as you get your
app in all those countries,


92
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,256
you're going to be
able to get revenue


93
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:15,326
in those countries as well.


94
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:20,906
Just like the actual
app purchase


95
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,376
and then In-App Purchases
as well, you're going


96
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,226
to get 70 percent of
the advertising revenue


97
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,196
from iAd inside your app.


98
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,596
Apple takes its 30 percent
share, and everything else goes


99
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:33,346
to you from whatever we
take in from the advertisers


100
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:38,666
who are producing these
ads to run inside your app.


101
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,046
It's very easy for you to
get into the iAd ecosystem.


102
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:47,176
There's an iAd contract on the
itunesconnect.apple.com site


103
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:47,926
that you have to sign.


104
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:49,186
That's pretty easy.


105
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,726
You integrate the iAd
framework; that's what the rest


106
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,896
of this talk is going
to be about.


107
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:54,876
And then, you submit
your app for review,


108
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,696
and that's really
all you have to do.


109
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:02,476
OK. So that's sort of
what iAd can do for you.


110
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,956
Let's talk about
some core concepts.


111
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,856
These are some fundamental
basics of advertising


112
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,406
and some terminology
that you're going to see,


113
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,966
especially on the iTunes Connect
website once you've integrated


114
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:17,106
iAd and are trying to track the
progress of you getting revenue


115
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,236
from iAd inside your app.


116
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:23,186
First of all, there's an ad
request, and you're going


117
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,506
to see this come up again.


118
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,906
Later, you'll see
this in metrics.


119
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:27,036
What is an ad request?


120
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:28,606
It's a network request.


121
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,936
It goes from the device,
through the iAd framework.


122
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:34,206
It's going to go out to the
iAd servers up in the cloud.


123
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,006
And hopefully, ads will
come back down to you,


124
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,836
assuming there are ads available
for your particular app


125
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,206
in the current situation
of the user.


126
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:46,526
You know, again, if the user
is in a country we're not in,


127
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:48,986
you're not going to be able to
get ads there, unfortunately.


128
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:53,616
Once you've started
getting ads from the -


129
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:56,336
if you get an ad request, you
want to look at your fill rate.


130
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,136
This is the ratio of ads
delivered by the ad server


131
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:03,056
to the number of requests that
you actually make to the server.


132
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,796
This is, again, going
to be determined


133
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:08,426
by where your users are located,
what type of app you have,


134
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,786
how well your app has
done with iAd in the past.


135
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:14,646
And we'll get to that in a
little bit - a little later,


136
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,556
as to how that can
be really important


137
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:18,106
in driving your fill rate.


138
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:22,496
Once you've gotten ads,
you've gotten your fill rate


139
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:23,906
and you've shown
ads to the user,


140
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,216
there's a constant called
the tap-through rate.


141
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,026
This is the number of the ads


142
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,266
that your user has
actually tapped on,


143
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,276
and this does not
count accidental taps.


144
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:35,256
So if the tap - if the user just
taps on it and then closes it


145
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,256
because they didn't really
mean it, that doesn't count.


146
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:40,606
This is the number of taps
that the user actually meant


147
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,036
to have happen relative
to the number


148
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,556
of ads you displayed
to that user.


149
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:45,626
This is something
you want to attempt


150
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:48,006
to maximize inside your app.


151
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,916
Again, though, accidental
taps don't count.


152
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,346
So trying to play games
is not a good idea.


153
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,476
Ad engagement.


154
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:01,386
Obviously, you need
to display the ad.


155
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,426
If you're not displaying
the ad to the user,


156
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,036
it doesn't matter how
many of them you request


157
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:08,406
from the server, you're not
going to get paid for them,


158
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,046
and you might as well
not have bothered.


159
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:16,046
Once you do that, make sure it's
actually fully visible as well.


160
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,916
The fact that it's onscreen and
only one pixel of it is showing


161
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,466
because you've got it covered
up with something else,


162
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:22,936
that doesn't really
count either.


163
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,756
You want to make sure
that the ad is visible


164
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:26,836
for as long as possible.


165
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,096
Leave it onscreen.


166
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:32,406
Again, if it shows
up and it flashes


167
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,866
for two seconds, no
one really saw it.


168
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:35,516
It doesn't matter.


169
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:37,746
You want to make sure
that ads are onscreen.


170
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,096
This is - has two benefits.


171
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,996
One, it's not distracting
to your user.


172
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,236
You're not annoying people
by flashing things on


173
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,376
and offscreen all the time that
people really don't want to see.


174
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:49,916
In addition, the user has
time to interact with it.


175
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:50,936
They have time to see it.


176
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,336
They have time to
see its message.


177
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,536
They have time to say, "Hey.


178
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,826
You know, I'd actually like to
tap on this and engage with it


179
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:59,656
and see what's going
on under the hood."


180
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:01,586
That leads into allow
interaction.


181
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,066
It's really easy to
put something onscreen


182
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,506
and accidentally cover it up,


183
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,686
especially accidentally
covering it up with something


184
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,066
that blocks user interaction.


185
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:12,236
If you put a banner onscreen,
you cover it up with something


186
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,746
that is, say, a transparent view


187
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,256
that does not allow user
interaction, the user can't tap


188
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,086
on the banner under the hood.


189
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,506
That's not a good
situation for the ad.


190
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,056
The user is going to
be trying to tap on it,


191
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,406
nothing's going to happen.


192
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,736
It's going to be
a bad experience.


193
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:28,446
In addition, again,
you're not going


194
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,576
to get the revenue you're hoping
for in this sort of situation


195
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,515
because the ad wasn't
really onscreen.


196
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:37,405
OK. So there's some
sort of core concepts.


197
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:39,035
Talk a little bit
about what you can do


198
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,746
to improve the performance


199
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,645
of iAd once you've actually
integrated it inside your app.


200
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,836
First of all, revenue
starts with your app.


201
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:49,296
If you don't have a great app,


202
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:51,746
it doesn't matter how
many banners you show,


203
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:53,176
it doesn't matter how
many ads you show.


204
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,406
No one is using your app,


205
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:55,806
and you're not going
to make any money.


206
00:08:55,806 --> 00:09:00,096
So the number one thing you
can do to drive revenue via ads


207
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:02,736
in your app is to start
off with a great app.


208
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:07,316
And that's what the rest of WWDC
is about, but a couple of sort


209
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,556
of small things we
can mention here.


210
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:11,136
First of all, app
engagement time.


211
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:14,306
If your - if you have an
app that's - you're trying


212
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:19,366
to drive revenue by showing
ads, you need to make sure


213
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:20,936
that your have sufficient
engagement time


214
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,096
for your users to
actually do this.


215
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:26,256
If it's a utility app that
the user is going to pull up,


216
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,606
it's going to be onscreen
for about three seconds,


217
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:30,396
and then they're going
to close your app again,


218
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,636
that's not enough time to
actually show ads to the users


219
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:36,666
and allow interaction and to get
interaction from those users.


220
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:39,996
So you need an app that
actually is going to be onscreen


221
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,756
and that people are actually
going to engage with.


222
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:46,436
Again, once you've done
that, you want to make sure


223
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:49,486
that the ad is placed
carefully within that app.


224
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:51,396
Think about what
the user is doing


225
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:52,636
on the various screens
of your app.


226
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:56,046
Make sure the ad is placed
appropriately within the app.


227
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,486
If you have a game,
for instance,


228
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:01,866
and the user is tapping and
swiping and slicing constantly,


229
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,746
maybe that's not a great place
for a banner where they're going


230
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:05,976
to be accidentally tapping.


231
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,956
The ad will pop up over
the top of everything.


232
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:11,206
You're going to be annoying
your users, and you're going


233
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:18,216
to be harming your app more than
you're helping it with the ads.


234
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:21,556
OK? Pulling back into app
engagement time: user loyalty.


235
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:24,246
You need to come - you need
your users to come back


236
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:26,446
to the app repeatedly.


237
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,656
That's how you get
more screen time,


238
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:30,766
that's how you get more ad
time for those particular -


239
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:33,446
for showing ads to those users.


240
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:37,396
In addition, user loyalty
is what drives ad -


241
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:40,046
or app engagement and
what drives app downloads.


242
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,606
The sort of network effects that
you may have heard of before.


243
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:45,406
The more people are using
your app, the more they want


244
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:47,146
to use it, the more they're
going to tell their friends


245
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,286
about using it, the more
downloads you're going to get.


246
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,486
Therefore, the more eyeballs
you're going to get looking


247
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:52,966
at ads within your app.


248
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:57,606
OK? I mentioned that
iAd is in 14 countries.


249
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,846
That means that your app should
be in 14 countries if you want


250
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:06,676
to get as most - the most
revenue from iAd as you can.


251
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,336
Market your app to the
countries where iAd actually is.


252
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,016
If you're - if you've spent
the time to integrate iAd


253
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,556
into your app, you want to make
sure that your app is in all


254
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:18,346
of the places that iAd is so you
have the largest reach possible


255
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:21,136
to potentially get the most
users possible for your app.


256
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,486
A big part of that is
localizing your app.


257
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:27,326
If the only thing you've done
is write your app in English,


258
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,916
and you're trying to get it
in all 14 of these countries,


259
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,266
you're going to have a
hard time in countries


260
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,056
where English has
a small presence.


261
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,806
Make sure you take the time to
localize your app appropriately


262
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:38,066
to drive users in
those countries.


263
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,596
And back into ad
placement a little bit,


264
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:46,126
because this is a piece I'm
going to keep coming back to.


265
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:50,016
Ad placement is extraordinarily
important within your app.


266
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:54,046
You will recognize high-use
areas inside your app,


267
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,356
and you want to make sure you
put banners inside those areas.


268
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,056
Those are the places where
users are going to be looking


269
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,406
at the screen for a
long period of time.


270
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:02,736
They're going to
have the opportunity


271
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:03,726
to see the app - the ad.


272
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:04,896
They're going to
have the opportunity


273
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:06,176
to engage with the ad.


274
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,326
At the same time,
as I mentioned,


275
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,906
avoid accidental taps.


276
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:15,016
Accidental taps are bad for your
user, and they're bad for you.


277
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:18,596
They're going to annoy
your user, and iAd doesn't


278
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,856
like accidental taps either.


279
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:23,096
So you want to make sure that
you are using the framework


280
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,966
in a way that does
not encourage them


281
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:29,816
because your app will ultimately
end up being penalized for this.


282
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:31,346
User context is really
important.


283
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:35,506
You want to take advantage of
different types of ads based


284
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,586
on what the user is
doing at any given time.


285
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,526
Say the user is on the
menu screen of your game.


286
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:42,936
Maybe that's a great
place to put a banner


287
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:43,846
at the bottom of the screen.


288
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,226
They're looking at the menu.


289
00:12:45,426 --> 00:12:47,526
Maybe they notice the app
- or the ad at the bottom.


290
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,886
Maybe they tap on it
and engage with it.


291
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:52,526
At the same time, if they tap
to go into the first level


292
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,406
of your game, and you
immediately pop a full-fledged


293
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:58,136
ad and interrupt their
experience once they've done


294
00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,496
their first action
inside the game,


295
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:01,156
that's just going to annoy them.


296
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,376
You're going to drive
users away.


297
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,716
Users aren't going to want
to engage with the ads.


298
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,866
That's what you want
to try to avoid.


299
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:10,106
So be very careful about
where you're putting the ads


300
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:13,186
within your app.


301
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:16,766
Once you've integrated iAd
and you can start looking


302
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,206
on the website, you'll
start getting reports


303
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,006
about your revenue.


304
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,866
One of the things
you're going to notice,


305
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:24,126
everyone always notices
this and brings this up,


306
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:26,136
is that revenue will fluctuate.


307
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,056
This is perfectly natural.


308
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,256
Consumer spending is seasonal.


309
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:33,466
Advertiser spending
is also seasonal


310
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:35,216
because consumer
spending is seasonal.


311
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,986
You need to be aware of
this and watch for it.


312
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,526
You can also take
advantage of this.


313
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,806
Market your app accordingly.


314
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:47,106
Start of summer, back to
school, holiday season -


315
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,356
these are the times
when users are going


316
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,586
out to get new devices, they're
going out to get new apps,


317
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:56,396
and advertisers are going out to
get eyeballs inside those apps.


318
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,656
So that's when you want to
try and get - try and put all


319
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:05,226
of your money into
pushing your app out there.


320
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,226
OK. We've talked about ads.


321
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,426
We've talked about impressions.


322
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:09,776
We've talked about tap-throughs.


323
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:11,186
We've talked about fill rate.


324
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,526
This is a virtuous cycle.


325
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,326
OK? You're going to
get ads to begin with.


326
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:17,606
They're going to
lead to impressions.


327
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,376
Impressions are going
to lead to tap-throughs.


328
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,706
The more tap-throughs you get,
the more ads you're going to get


329
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:27,436
from the ad server, the more
impressions you're going to get.


330
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,126
OK. So that's performance.


331
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,526
Now that we've done that, now we
can go into some actual details


332
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,446
about how you actually go about
integrating all of this stuff,


333
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:35,646
sort of the meat of this talk.


334
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,016
There's four ad formats.


335
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,386
There's banner, there's
interstitial,


336
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:44,216
there's medium rect, and
there's a pre-roll video ad.


337
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,366
We'll talk about each
of these four in turn.


338
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:49,276
As I mentioned earlier,
you're going to want


339
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:51,816
to choose the correct
ad for your app


340
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,456
in the various contexts
within your app.


341
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,696
So all four of these types


342
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:59,266
of ads are important
for many, many apps.


343
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,706
We'll start off with banner.


344
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:05,676
OK? So what is a banner?


345
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:08,576
It's a slim device width view.


346
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,696
It's placed at the
bottom of your content.


347
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:15,196
It continuously loads ads.


348
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:19,716
You may have used other iAd
SDKs or ad SDKs where you've got


349
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:20,676
to make a specific request.


350
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:21,666
This isn't that.


351
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,286
You create a view.


352
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,036
It's going to show up at
the bottom of the page


353
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:26,636
and will continuously
load ads over time


354
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,326
as new ads are downloaded
from the ad server.


355
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:31,806
There's nothing you have
to do to manage that.


356
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:34,246
Once the user taps on it, it's
going to go into some sort


357
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:38,276
of full-screen ad
experience - and supported


358
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:39,596
on both iPhone and iPad.


359
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,686
It has been since
the beginning of iAd.


360
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:46,626
Integrating banners
in your app is


361
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:48,236
about the simplest
thing that you could do.


362
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:49,996
There's three steps to this.


363
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,536
You're going to link
the iAd framework.


364
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,826
You're going to import
the iAd header,


365
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:58,116
which is the first
line that popped there.


366
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,056
And you're going to configure
your view controller,


367
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:02,626
which involves setting the
.canDisplayBannerAds property


368
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,326
to yes on your view controller.


369
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:05,866
That's it.


370
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:09,186
If you've done that, you've
got a banner inside your app.


371
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:12,046
OK? So what does that look like?


372
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:13,526
OK. Loading an ad.


373
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:15,316
You've got your view.


374
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:18,336
The moment you set the
.canDisplayBannerAds property


375
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,466
on it, we're going to do
something under the hood


376
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,526
to your view controller.


377
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:25,186
Your view is going to turn
into original content view.


378
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,526
We're going to move your view
over to original content view,


379
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,746
and we're going to take a
review on your view controller.


380
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,616
So it's very important
for you to remember


381
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,756
if you're subsequently
attempting to access your view


382
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:35,786
on that view controller.


383
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,366
We're then going to make a
request up the ad server.


384
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,816
It's going to come back


385
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,106
and hopefully a banner
is going to load.


386
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:47,116
And at that time, we're going
to move the banner onscreen


387
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,216
and we're going to resize
your original content view


388
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,986
appropriately and with
the appropriate animation


389
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:52,956
to move the thing onscreen


390
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:57,866
so the user can actually
look at it.


391
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,376
Once it's been onscreen
for a while,


392
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:01,116
hopefully the user is going
to go ahead and tap on it.


393
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,356
And at that point,


394
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:04,576
the full-screen ad
experience is going to pop up.


395
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:08,616
When that happens, there are a
couple of things you need to do.


396
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:11,976
First of which is to pause
activity in -viewWillDisappear:.


397
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:15,036
Your app is probably doing
things in the background while


398
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:16,246
that banner is onscreen.


399
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,796
When the user wants
to engage with the ad,


400
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,376
you want to get out of the way.


401
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,116
If you're playing music.


402
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,165
If you're running
a game simulation.


403
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,445
If you're doing anything else
that's potentially intensive


404
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:28,956
or distracting, you're
going to pause that activity


405
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,266
in -viewWillDisappear:
so that it gets


406
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:34,106
out of the way of the ad.


407
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,756
Eventually, the user will be
done interacting with the ad.


408
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,536
They'll dismiss it.


409
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:38,826
You'll get a -viewDidAppear:.


410
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,706
Resume all that activity.


411
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,286
Once the ad's gone, you want
to start the music up again.


412
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:48,476
You want to start your
game simulation, etcetera.


413
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:51,496
Eventually, say the user goes
out of network connectivity


414
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:54,266
or something, you may not
have an ad available anymore.


415
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:58,296
When that happens, the banner is
going to be moved off of screen.


416
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:03,706
The original content view will
resized and that - and you can,


417
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:05,756
you know, wait until it
hopefully reloads again.


418
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,416
In addition to waiting for
the network connectivity


419
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,826
to just move the banner
back off of screen,


420
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,976
you can control the banner
visibility whenever you


421
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:14,446
would like.


422
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,286
If something happens within
your app that you would


423
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:19,226
like to move the banner
offscreen temporarily,


424
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,316
you can go ahead and so.


425
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:23,246
Just go ahead and set
.canDisplayBannerAds to no.


426
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,366
Just don't forget to
set it back to yes


427
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:27,626
when you want to re-enable it.


428
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:30,676
Make sure you put the ad back
onscreen whenever you actually


429
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:33,076
need to.


430
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,606
OK. So that's banners.


431
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:37,326
Let's talk about interstitials
next, which is the sort


432
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,836
of second major type of
banner - type of ad here.


433
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,956
Very different than banners.


434
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,436
Rather than something
being permanently onscreen,


435
00:18:44,886 --> 00:18:46,866
they're immediate
full-screen display.


436
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,096
They immediately take
over the entire screen


437
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,036
when you want to present them.


438
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:52,646
The user is immediately
able to interact with them.


439
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:56,086
OK? They've been on
iPad since iOS 4.3,


440
00:18:56,146 --> 00:19:00,556
and they were introduced on
the phone in iOS 7 last year.


441
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,836
There's two major ways to handle
interstitial presentation.


442
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:07,566
The first is automatic
presentation.


443
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,416
Just like banners, it's pretty
simple to configure here.


444
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,766
Rather than setting
.canDisplayBannerAds,


445
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:15,456
you're going to set
.interstitialPresentationPolicy


446
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,556
to ADInterstitial
PresentationPolicyAutomatic.


447
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,286
What that does is tell
the iAd framework, hey,


448
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:24,586
this is a great view
controller to show ads on,


449
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,026
and whenever you, as the iAd
framework, think is a great time


450
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,916
to show ads, go ahead and do so.


451
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:33,236
At the moment, that means
that we're going to show ads


452
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:37,296
when this view controller first
moves onscreen, when it appears.


453
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,786
I'm going to take
that as an opportunity


454
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:41,426
to show an interstitial
ad if one is available.


455
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:44,336
So to do that, just take
your view controller,


456
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,206
push it onscreen, make it - push
it into your navigation stack,


457
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,696
or however you want
to put it onscreen.


458
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,776
That moves in, and we're going
to pop an ad up over top of it.


459
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:54,496
When the user is
done interacting


460
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,776
with it, it'll come back off.


461
00:19:58,136 --> 00:19:59,716
In addition to automatic
presentation,


462
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,236
there's manual presentation.


463
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:02,936
Just set the presentation policy


464
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,286
to ADInterstitial
PresentationPolicyManual,


465
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:08,436
and instead of us automatically
presenting it whenever the view


466
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:10,396
moves onscreen, you can call -


467
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:12,976
request interstitial ad
presentation to attempt


468
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:15,096
to display it whenever you
think it's an appropriate time


469
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,976
for an ad to pop up over
top of your content.


470
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,446
Next, preparing for
presentation.


471
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:28,966
Because interstitials don't
have something onscreen,


472
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,046
something sitting
there requesting ads,


473
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,786
attempting to display
things at all times,


474
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,506
you want to notify the iAd
framework that you would


475
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:38,836
like to present interstitials
in the future so we can go ahead


476
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:41,726
and make an ad request and
have an interstitial waiting


477
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:43,846
for you when that time comes.


478
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:46,496
To do that, you're going to want


479
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:51,776
to call UIViewController
prepareInterstitialAds inside


480
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,236
something early in
your app's life cycle.


481
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:56,666
ApplicationDidFinish
LaunchingWithOptions is a good


482
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,606
opportunity here.


483
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,456
If you're doing a lot of
other work at that point,


484
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:00,506
maybe defer it a little bit.


485
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,496
But you want to call this
prior to your attempt


486
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,926
to present an interstitial
for the first time.


487
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,966
That gives the iAd
framework enough time to go


488
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:12,056
out to the network, request an
ad, and have everything ready


489
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:14,846
to present by the time you
want one to be presented.


490
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:17,786
That will prevent you from
missing ad opportunities.


491
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:21,456
OK. So that's banners
and interstitials.


492
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:24,346
We're going to go from
here into a quick demo just


493
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,506
of the APIs I just went over.


494
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:33,076
So we'll switch over to
my demo machine here.


495
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:36,606
What I'm going to start off
with here, I'll just draw


496
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:40,976
up my little app, is a very
simple master detail app here.


497
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:43,396
Just shows some news articles.


498
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,776
I can click on one of these
news articles and bring it up.


499
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:49,646
And what we'd like to do is
take this app and add some ads


500
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,106
to it, monetize it with iAd.


501
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:54,126
So if I can quit the
simulator again here.


502
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,026
What do we want to
do here first?


503
00:21:56,346 --> 00:22:00,316
The first thing we're going to
do is add a banner to the bottom


504
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:03,136
of the MasterViewController,
the bottom of that article list.


505
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:05,346
So inside our
MasterViewController here,


506
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:09,046
we're going to import
the iAd header.


507
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:10,866
Do that like this.


508
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:14,346
And then, inside, awakeFromNib,
all we're going to do is call -


509
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:18,026
set self.canDisplayBannerAds
to yes,


510
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,516
and that's really
all we have to do.


511
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:22,436
Oh, one more thing.


512
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:26,806
We need to go in here,
development phases,


513
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:29,426
and ensure that we link
against the iAd framework.


514
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:36,036
Make sure the APIs are actually
available to us, so we go back


515
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:38,096
to MasterViewController here.


516
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:39,406
Go ahead and run.


517
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:48,916
And we'll see that with two
lines of code and one link,


518
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,766
we have banners at the
bottom of our screen


519
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:54,496
that are automatically in
line with our view controller.


520
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:58,586
Now, we only set that on
the MasterViewController.


521
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,216
That means that when we go into
an article, there's no ad there,


522
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,486
which is a little
bit unfortunate.


523
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,346
So the next thing we want
to do is take advantage


524
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:08,316
of the other type of ad that
we talked about, interstitials,


525
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:11,366
to present an ad
to the user prior


526
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,346
to them actually being
able to read the article.


527
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:16,526
So once they've tapped
on the article title,


528
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:18,716
we want to add the
popup over the top


529
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:20,706
of the screen before they
can actually see the article.


530
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:24,236
So let's go ahead
and quit this again.


531
00:23:25,176 --> 00:23:29,826
And this time, we're
going to, down here,


532
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,816
inside our prepareForSegue
function, we're just going


533
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:34,986
to set up the
DetailViewController


534
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,836
that shows the actual article.


535
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:41,626
We're going to grab this
destination.interstitial


536
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:43,966
PresentationPolicy
ADinterstitial


537
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,596
PresentationPolicyAutomatic
so that we can say


538
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:48,046
that on this
DetailViewController,


539
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:49,266
the thing that's
showing the article,


540
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:53,056
we want the iAd framework
to manage presentation


541
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,066
of interstitial ads over
top of this view controller.


542
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,596
Once we've done that, that's
going to get interstitials shown


543
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:01,476
over that view controller.


544
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:04,576
However, we want to make sure
that the iAd framework knows


545
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,236
to go out and look


546
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,146
for interstitials
before the user taps


547
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,616
on an article for
the first time.


548
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,266
So to do that, we're
going to go over here.


549
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:13,056
We're going to get to
our AppDelegate here,


550
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,416
and we're just going to
grab UIViewController


551
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:18,556
prepareInterstitialAds.


552
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,196
Make sure we import
the header as well.


553
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:25,456
That tells iAd, hey, go
prepare interstitial ads


554
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:26,936
so they're ready
for our user here.


555
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,406
So I'll go ahead and save this.


556
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:31,936
Run our demo again.


557
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,016
Once again, we've got
the article view here.


558
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,186
We've got a banner loaded
at the bottom that happened.


559
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:43,566
Now, once the user taps on this,
the interstitial ad is going


560
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,146
to pop up over top
of the article.


561
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:47,196
Once the appropriate
time is expired,


562
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,716
the user is done interacting
with this, they can go ahead


563
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:52,516
and close that, and the article
is behind, and they can go ahead


564
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:54,206
and start reading their article.


565
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:58,786
So that's basically how easy
it is to integrate banners


566
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:01,766
and interstitials to your app.


567
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,116
So we'll go back to the slides.


568
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:08,906
OK. So that's banners
and interstitials,


569
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:12,716
which are the first two
major types of ads for iAd.


570
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:15,576
They were also the first two
types of ads that iAd had.


571
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,276
Those were the ones that were
sort of available pretty much


572
00:25:17,276 --> 00:25:18,396
from the beginning of iAd.


573
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:20,646
There are a couple of
newer types that we've got.


574
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,706
The first new type, it's
- talking about banners


575
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,926
and interstitial a
little bit more, sorry.


576
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:31,916
First of all, use
.canDisplayBannerAds


577
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:34,006
and
.interstitialPresentationPolicy


578
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:36,166
on your controllers
as much as possible.


579
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:39,096
We talked about ad engagement.


580
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:42,326
We talked about the user having
the opportunity to see the ads,


581
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:45,556
leaving them onscreen, the
user having the opportunity


582
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:46,576
to engage with the ads.


583
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:51,846
Setting these properties
is a big part of that.


584
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:54,256
In addition, remember to
use .originalContentView


585
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,306
when you actually use
.canDisplayBannerAds.


586
00:25:56,646 --> 00:25:59,706
It's very important that once
you set .canDisplayBannerAds,


587
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:02,376
you realize that you have
given over control of view


588
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:03,946
to the iAd framework,


589
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:07,676
and .originalContentView
is yours to continue using.


590
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:14,206
Pick the right transitions
for interstitials.


591
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:17,426
Think about what your user
is doing at any given time


592
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:18,176
when they're transitioning


593
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,596
from view controller
to view controller.


594
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:20,546
And make sure


595
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,506
that .interstitialPresentation
PolicyAutomatic is set


596
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:26,376
on the appropriate view
controllers for an ad to show


597
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,086
up when they first pop up.


598
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:31,436
For instance, in the news
demo that we just showed you,


599
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:36,196
having that show up on the
main article list is probably


600
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:37,106
not appropriate.


601
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:39,046
That would just be distracting
and annoying to users.


602
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,536
Having it on the article view
controller, on the other hand,


603
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,776
just gives a gating
function to allowing the user


604
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,766
to actually use your content.


605
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,946
That's sort of the appropriate
use for the interstitial.


606
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:55,046
Be consistent throughout
your navigation stack


607
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,896
in your use of these.


608
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:59,816
This is particularly important
for navigation controllers,


609
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:02,106
in particular deep
navigation controllers.


610
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:05,576
What I mean by this
is, in particular


611
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:07,126
with .canDisplayBannerAds,


612
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:10,306
if you have a deep navigation
hierarchy, you want to attempt


613
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:13,256
to set .canDisplayBannerAds on
as many of the view controllers


614
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,016
that you're going to be pushing
into that hierarchy as possible


615
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:18,806
to ensure that the
ad remains onscreen


616
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,566
as the user navigates
throughout that hierarchy.


617
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:24,426
Otherwise, you have the
possibility of the ad popping


618
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,956
up onscreen for a second.


619
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:28,776
The user taps on something;
the ad goes back away.


620
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:30,666
They tapped to something else.


621
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,656
Maybe the ad comes back.


622
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:33,536
That's distracting to your user.


623
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:35,706
At the same time, it
doesn't allow the ad


624
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:38,916
to stay onscreen long
enough for the user


625
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:43,506
to actually engage with that ad.


626
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,586
OK. So now, we're done talking
with banners and interstitials.


627
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,576
Let's talk about medium rect,
which is then next major type


628
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:52,106
of ad that iAd provides to you.


629
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:54,346
What is a medium rect?


630
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:58,056
It is an International
Advertising Bureau medium


631
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,896
rectangle; it's a
standard ad type.


632
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,146
It's positioned inline
with your content.


633
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:06,166
It's a standardized size;
this is the same size


634
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,026
that you may have seen when
you're browsing the web.


635
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:08,976
You see this sort of square


636
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:12,416
or rectangular ads positioned
inline with the web content.


637
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,136
This is the same type
of ad that we've got.


638
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:18,216
Just like banners, they
automatically cycle over time.


639
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,616
So you put them onscreen,
new ads will be loaded


640
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,456
out of the iAd framework
- feels appropriate -


641
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:25,306
and will automatically
manage making a request


642
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,526
and putting ads in here for you.


643
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:31,876
And just like banners, there's
a full-screen ad experience once


644
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,846
the user taps on and
engages with this banner.


645
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:41,466
They were introduced in iOS 6
on iPads and happy to announce


646
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:44,226
that in iOS 8, we're adding
this to phone as well.


647
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:51,066
OK. So what's the medium
rectangle life cycle look like?


648
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:56,466
Because these banners are not
managed by the iAd framework,


649
00:28:56,466 --> 00:29:00,536
you have to do a little bit
more work to put these onscreen.


650
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:04,316
OK? You need to create the
banner explicitly rather


651
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:06,176
than just setting a property
on your view controller.


652
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,036
You need to configure a
delegate, which is going


653
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:10,826
to allow us to tell you
when certain things happen,


654
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,766
and we're going to get into the
code for this in the next slide.


655
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:16,836
Implement the delegate protocol
so you can actually take notice


656
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:18,816
of these events and move
the thing on and offscreen


657
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:20,896
as the banner loads and unloads.


658
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:24,176
You're going to show the banner


659
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:26,016
when you receive the
-bannerViewDidLoadAd:


660
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,836
property - or delegate callback.


661
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:30,556
You're going to pause activity


662
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:33,096
in -bannerViewActionShould
Begin:willLeaveApplication:.


663
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:36,746
This is analogous to getting
the view will disappear message


664
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,506
from interstitials or banners.


665
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:43,206
And you want to resume activity
in -bannerViewActionDidFinish:,


666
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:44,426
analogous to view will appear.


667
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:47,946
You're going to hide the
banner in -bannerView:


668
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:49,356
didFailTo ReceiveAdWithError:.


669
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:50,136
This is important.


670
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,446
This indicates that your banner
no longer has an ad loaded


671
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:55,586
and it should no longer be
taking up space onscreen.


672
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,276
So what does this look like?


673
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,606
First of all, creating a banner.


674
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:03,276
You're going to import
the iAd header at the top.


675
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:06,506
You're going to implement
ADBannerViewDelegate


676
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:08,016
on whatever object you would


677
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,416
like to actually be managing
this particular banner.


678
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:13,336
Then you're going to
create the banner view.


679
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:15,456
You can do that with
initWithAdType:


680
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:18,826
ADAdTypeMediumRectangle,
and then you're going


681
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:19,576
to set the delegate


682
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:20,936
to the object that's
implementing the


683
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:21,766
delegate protocol.


684
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:24,236
So what does that delegate
protocol look like?


685
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:28,346
Well, first how does a medium
rect actually load and unload?


686
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:29,466
It's going to start
out unloaded.


687
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:30,936
When you first create it
there's nothing in there.


688
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:32,016
We haven't made an ad request.


689
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,316
There's nothing to
put onscreen yet.


690
00:30:33,496 --> 00:30:35,786
So don't put it onscreen
when you first create it.


691
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:36,976
It's just going to
be a blank slide,


692
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:40,436
and we're going to
send you an error.


693
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:42,186
Once you get a
-bannerViewDidLoadAd:,


694
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:45,656
that's your cue that there is an
ad available inside your medium


695
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:47,296
rect, and you should
move it onscreen.


696
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,046
You're going to leave
the banner onscreen


697
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:51,176
as long as it has an ad.


698
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,816
Remember, too, that this is
something that's supposed


699
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:55,936
to be positioned inline
with your content.


700
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:58,006
When you move it onscreen,
when you leave it onscreen,


701
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:00,666
make sure that it's within
the rest of your content.


702
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:03,656
If you have an article and you
put the medium rect onscreen


703
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:05,446
with the article, text
should flow around it.


704
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,196
It should be inside a
scroll view and scroll


705
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:09,136
with the rest of your content.


706
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:12,536
That's what this type
of ad is intended for.


707
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,906
You're going to move the
banner back offscreen


708
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:19,036
in bannerView:didFail
ToReceiveAdWithError.


709
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,866
Again, once you move
it offscreen,


710
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:23,266
it's your responsibility
to reflow your content


711
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:28,856
to fill the hole that
was just left by the ad.


712
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:30,376
At that time, it's
going to move offscreen.


713
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:31,646
You reflow up your content.


714
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,956
This is what banner loading and
unloading is going to look like.


715
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,316
You're going - there's
two important delegate


716
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:37,956
callbacks here.


717
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:40,686
BannerViewDidLoadAd, in
which case you're just going


718
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:43,936
to put the banner onscreen,
rehandle all of your layout.


719
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,286
And bannerView
didFailToReceiveAdWithError,


720
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:48,196
you're going to remove
it from the super view.


721
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,316
You're going to do the converse.


722
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,736
You're going to, again,
layout, reflowing your content


723
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:53,596
around the hole that was
left by the banner view.


724
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:57,796
So some best practices
for medium rectangle.


725
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,676
Again, this is great
for reflowable content.


726
00:32:00,676 --> 00:32:02,266
This is the sort of
thing that you're going


727
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:05,776
to put inside a scroll view,
within the rest of your content


728
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,416
that may scroll up and
down along the device,


729
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:09,796
may go on- and offscreen.


730
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:13,136
It's sort of static with
the rest of your content -


731
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:15,436
flows around it, fills a hole


732
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:17,736
with inside the space
on the screen.


733
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:22,446
It's got a full-screen
ad on tap, remember that.


734
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:26,956
Pay attention to the delegate
callbacks for willBeginAction,


735
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:30,086
didFinishAction so that you
can pause and resume activity.


736
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,956
Pause it in
bannerViewActionShouldBegin.


737
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:38,126
And resume activity in
bannerViewActionDidFinish.


738
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:40,476
So that's medium rectangle.


739
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:43,136
A little bit more complicated
than the banner because you have


740
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:44,466
to manage positioning yourself,


741
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:46,436
but still fairly
simple to implement.


742
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:51,466
OK, the fourth type of ad
that we're going to talk


743
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:52,966
about here is the pre-roll.


744
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:56,396
What is a pre-roll?


745
00:32:56,646 --> 00:33:00,326
The video pre-roll is a short
video that plays between -


746
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,646
before your own media content.


747
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:08,886
It's full-screen ad on tap, just
like the other banner types.


748
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,546
It was added in iOS 7.


749
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,566
And in iOS 7 we added it
on MPMoviePlayerController.


750
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,056
And new in iOS 8
we're also adding it


751
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:20,966
on AVPlayerViewController,
new AV kit APIs


752
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,406
that are introduced
here at WWDC.


753
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:27,206
This is available on both
iPhone and iPad and has been


754
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,916
since the initial introduction.


755
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:32,826
I want to sort of circle back
to the very first bullet here,


756
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:34,306
the short video plays
before content.


757
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:35,706
This is really important.


758
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:38,256
This is not an
interstitial-style ad.


759
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:41,036
This is something to be
played before your content,


760
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:41,976
so you need to make sure


761
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,606
that you actually have a
video to play after it.


762
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:47,916
We don't want - it's not
supported for you to attempt


763
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:50,946
to use this just to play a
random ad at a random time.


764
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,986
Make sure that you have
content to follow it;


765
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:55,286
that's what the API
is designed for.


766
00:33:57,496 --> 00:34:00,626
So setting up and playback,
also fairly straightforward.


767
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:01,476
You're going to start off


768
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:03,636
by linking the MediaPlayer
and iAd frameworks.


769
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:05,856
Import Media and iAd headers.


770
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:06,986
You're going to create a player.


771
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:09,406
You're going to tell it to
play the pre-roll video,


772
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:10,946
and then you'll play
your content video.


773
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,216
Very straightforward.


774
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,966
Basically almost all
those except the iAd vids


775
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,186
and the play pre-roll
you already have to do


776
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:18,536
if you've got your own content.


777
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:21,016
This is just a few
tiny additional lines.


778
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:22,846
So what does that look like?


779
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:25,686
First import MediaPlayer
and import iAd.


780
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:29,656
You're going to create your
MPMoviePlayerController.


781
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:30,076
You're going


782
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:31,985
to initWithContentURL
as you already would.


783
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:34,025
You're going to add
that MoviePlayer


784
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:36,396
into your view hierarchy
so that it's onscreen.


785
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,746
Call layouts, you
redo your layout


786
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:39,755
for it once it's there as well.


787
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:43,315
And then you're going to
call playPrerollAdWith


788
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,306
CompletionHandler.


789
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:45,576
You're going to call
this instead


790
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:47,056
of immediately calling Play.


791
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:50,696
This tells iAd, "Hey, try
to put a pre-roll video


792
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:51,735
in there if you've got one.


793
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,376
Play that first."


794
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:55,636
This takes a completion handler.


795
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,036
It's going to return
an error possibly


796
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:57,926
if something went wrong.


797
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:01,986
Inside the completion handler is
your cue to start your content.


798
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:05,026
You want to make sure you don't
automatically play your content.


799
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,216
You want to pause your content


800
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:08,256
until this actually
begins playing,


801
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,126
or until the pre-roll
finishes playing and you want


802
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:14,306
to begin your own content then.


803
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:15,886
For AVKit it's almost identical.


804
00:35:15,926 --> 00:35:18,236
You're going to create an
AVPlayerViewController instead.


805
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:19,846
You're going to import
the AVKit headers.


806
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:22,156
And you're going to call, again,


807
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,696
playPrerollAdWith
CompletionHandler.


808
00:35:23,696 --> 00:35:25,056
It has identical semantics


809
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,986
to the MPMediaPlayerController
ones.


810
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:30,266
Inside the completion handler,
you're going to call player play


811
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:33,056
to start your own video
content afterward.


812
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:34,766
This is new in iOS 8.


813
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,536
Just like interstitials, because
this is something that is going


814
00:35:40,536 --> 00:35:43,626
to happen at some point and
you want to have iAd prepare it


815
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,056
for it you need to tell
the iAd framework, "Hey,


816
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,586
I'm going to want to play
pre-rolls in the future."


817
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:50,896
That allows us to have
the opportunity to go


818
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:54,656
out to the ad server, grab ads,
and be ready for your request


819
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:56,586
to play pre-rolls so that
we can actually play one


820
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:58,886
when the user does
something that requires it.


821
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:01,766
To do that, just like
interstitials you don't want


822
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:04,006
to miss these early impressions,
so you're going to want


823
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:05,346
to start ad requests early


824
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,746
by calling
MPMoviePlayerController


825
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,146
preparePrerollAds.


826
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:11,626
Again, probably an
application did finish launching


827
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:15,896
with options or some other early
in your app's life cycle period,


828
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:18,216
so we haven't had an
opportunity to go get ads


829
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:20,506
for you before you
call the APIs.


830
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,256
If you're using AVKit
it's almost identical,


831
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:26,286
AVPlayerController
preparePrerollAds instead.


832
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:33,346
Going with best practices for
video then: Don't play content


833
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:34,886
until the ad completes.


834
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:38,396
If you've called playPrerollAd,


835
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:42,156
and then half a second later you
call play before we've called


836
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:45,296
your completion handler,
we're going to interrupt it.


837
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,646
You know, notification handling
is a very common case for this.


838
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,246
This is going to interrupt
playing of the pre-roll ad.


839
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:53,506
It's going to immediately skip.


840
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:54,646
It's going to go
to your content.


841
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:56,396
And it's like the ad
never played except


842
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:58,376
that it's a poor user
experience for your user.


843
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:00,346
You'd like to try to
avoid this when possible.


844
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,366
So make sure that you wait


845
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:04,466
until our completion handler
is called to call play.


846
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,036
For notifications,


847
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:07,876
this frequently means
just recording the fact


848
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,126
that your content is ready.


849
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:12,506
If you're already calling
play in these notifications,


850
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:16,626
instead of just calling
play, record that fact,


851
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:18,116
and inside the completion
handler check


852
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:19,506
for that fact, and
then call play.


853
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:23,896
Similarly, defer
UI customization.


854
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:26,636
Many of you may be doing
UI customization on top


855
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:28,846
of the MediaPlayer controller
to present custom controls


856
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,486
or present custom UI around it.


857
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:32,286
Wait to do that until


858
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:33,956
after we've called your
completion handler.


859
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:37,306
The pre-roll already has
custom UI, and you don't want


860
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:40,586
to interfere with that custom
UI with your own customization.


861
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:43,496
That's, again, going to
provide a very poor experience


862
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:44,266
for your users.


863
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:48,286
OK, so now that we've
got that, let's go back


864
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:49,356
to our demo machine here.


865
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:52,136
I've got a quick demo
setting that up as well.


866
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:57,656
Let's close - yep - that.


867
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:03,446
I can pull up quick little
demo of this as well.


868
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:06,466
Can run this.


869
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,396
This is a very simple
little app,


870
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:13,636
just provides a few quick
little video clips here.


871
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:17,066
I can click on one of these
and we've got a quick video.


872
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:20,116
Now what I'd like to do is, now
that I've got this video content


873
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:21,506
that my user would
like to engage with,


874
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:25,066
I'd like to monetize this by
playing a pre-roll ad prior


875
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,476
to the user actually being
able to view my clips.


876
00:38:27,966 --> 00:38:30,426
So let's go ahead and quit
this and see what we have


877
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:31,436
to do to get that done.


878
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:36,356
We can start off here - the very
first thing we need to do is,


879
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,936
as for interstitials, we want
to make sure that we tell iAd,


880
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:41,276
"Hey, I'm going to be
playing pre-roll ads,


881
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:42,566
go fetch them early."


882
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:44,806
We'll start off in
our app delegate here,


883
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:53,496
and we will import iAd, and
we'll import the MediaPlayer


884
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,776
so we have the appropriate
classes for our APIs.


885
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:59,656
And we'll go ahead and
call preparePrerollAds


886
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:00,986
on MPMoviePlayerController.


887
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,286
Once we've done that, we
need to actually go ahead


888
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:06,256
and call preparePrerollAds,


889
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,106
so we'll go to our
View Controller here,


890
00:39:08,106 --> 00:39:11,226
which is doing the actual
display, and we're going


891
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,946
to scroll down to -
at the bottom here,


892
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:16,736
collectionView
didSelectItemAtIndexPath.


893
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:19,296
This is what happens when
the user actually taps on it.


894
00:39:19,596 --> 00:39:22,086
At the moment, all
we're doing is creating


895
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:25,236
MPMoviePlayerViewController,
setting the content URL,


896
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:26,766
and then calling
presentMoviePlayer


897
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:28,216
to have it start
playing automatically.


898
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,996
We want to sort of
interrupt that briefly,


899
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,636
and instead we're
going to go ahead


900
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:37,386
and call playPrerollAdWith
CompletionHandler.


901
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:39,816
And again, inside the
completion handler to that,


902
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:43,456
that's where we're going to call
mpvController.moviePlayer play.


903
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:48,766
Go back up to the top here, and
ensure that we are importing iAd


904
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:52,186
as well, so we get the
iAd APIs available.


905
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:54,266
Go ahead and save that.


906
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,386
We can run again.


907
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:03,016
No. This is what I
knew I was going to do.


908
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:05,076
Once again, we got
to go in here,


909
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:06,976
make sure that the iAd
framework is linked.


910
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:15,186
Now we can run it.


911
00:40:16,286 --> 00:40:20,256
OK, and we got our ad up
- our app up here again,


912
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:22,156
same quick little videos.


913
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:24,506
We can go ahead and click
on one of these now.


914
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,766
And before the video content
actually plays you see


915
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:32,366
that we've got an iAd workbench
ad that comes up instead.


916
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:36,236
The user can view
this ad content.


917
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:37,996
Once they're done with it
they can decide to go ahead


918
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:40,216
and skip ahead of it, and
we go immediately back


919
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:42,956
to the video content
for the app itself.


920
00:40:43,186 --> 00:40:46,826
And that's pretty much
all that's involved


921
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:50,996
in implementing pre-rolls once
you've already got MediaPlayer


922
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:53,436
content for that pre-roll
to play in front of.


923
00:40:54,546 --> 00:40:59,246
OK, so those are the four
different types of ads


924
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:01,976
that we have for integration
with iAd inside your app.


925
00:41:02,486 --> 00:41:03,926
Once you've started using them,


926
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,356
let's talk a little
bit about testing.


927
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,166
First of all, there are a
couple of things we add -


928
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:13,226
we've added to the developer
settings on the phone


929
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:17,166
to help you test the integration
of iAd within your app.


930
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:20,246
First, you can adjust
the fill rate.


931
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:25,216
This is inside the apps that you
have when you're testing them


932
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,896
on the device - you can adjust
how frequently you're going


933
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:28,566
to get ads.


934
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:30,476
This allows you to
test error conditions.


935
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,836
It allows you to test always
working conditions and make sure


936
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:35,516
that your app handles those
conditions appropriately.


937
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:39,776
In addition you can adjust
the refresh rate for things


938
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:41,406
like banners and medium rects.


939
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:42,876
This is going to
adjust the frequency


940
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,436
with which new ads come in.


941
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:49,036
In addition, in combination with
the fill rate this allows you


942
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,676
to rapidly test error


943
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:53,786
and nonerror conditions moving
things on- and offscreen.


944
00:41:57,676 --> 00:42:00,226
Most importantly there's
a switch called Highlight


945
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,016
Clipped Banners.


946
00:42:01,316 --> 00:42:04,316
If you're using the
.canDisplayBannerAds,


947
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:06,216
this isn't going to
affect banners very much,


948
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:08,366
but this is very
important for medium rect.


949
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:12,486
It's very easy to accidently
occlude part of the medium rect


950
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,376
with some other UI element.


951
00:42:14,426 --> 00:42:17,356
If you do that, that's a
part of the medium rect


952
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:18,796
that may not be seen
by your user.


953
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:20,516
It's a part of the
medium rect that you -


954
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:23,156
that the user may not be able
to tap on and interact with.


955
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,336
This will detect that.


956
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:27,856
You turn on the Highlight
Clipped Banners button.


957
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:30,246
We're going to provide
a green or a red overlay


958
00:42:30,556 --> 00:42:33,616
over your medium rect, or
banners, or instructions


959
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:37,006
for that matter, that will show
when the user can actually tap


960
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:38,406
on all parts of this banner,


961
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,176
when it is officially
onscreen and visible.


962
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,136
You want to make
sure that any banners


963
00:42:43,136 --> 00:42:45,426
that you show inside your
app are always green.


964
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:52,456
Remember this only affects your
apps, your developer-mode apps


965
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:55,696
that you have run from Xcode
and deployed onto your device.


966
00:42:55,696 --> 00:42:57,926
So no, you can't just
fill right to zero


967
00:42:57,926 --> 00:43:00,276
for all the other iAd-using
apps on your device.


968
00:43:00,276 --> 00:43:02,376
This only affects
developer-mode apps.


969
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:06,656
OK, so that's monetization.


970
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:09,006
That was sort of the first
major portion of the talk.


971
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,226
Let's talk next a little
bit about promotion.


972
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:13,946
This is the other half
of the iAd ecosystem.


973
00:43:14,046 --> 00:43:18,986
This is how you can use iAd to
drive downloads of your own app.


974
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,606
So there's three major parts


975
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:24,856
that we're going
to talk about here.


976
00:43:24,856 --> 00:43:27,716
First I'm going to do a really
quick intro to iAd Workbench.


977
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:29,126
There's another session
on that tomorrow


978
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,156
if you get more in detail.


979
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:31,396
So this is just a
quick overview.


980
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:35,426
And then there are two new APIs
that we're introducing in iOS 8,


981
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:39,486
one for app attribution and one
for app audience retargeting.


982
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:42,406
And we'll talk a little
bit about those new APIs.


983
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,436
Let's start off with
iAd Workbench.


984
00:43:45,596 --> 00:43:46,616
What is iAd Workbench?


985
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:48,806
iAd Workbench is
iAd's self-servicing


986
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:50,246
advertising platform.


987
00:43:50,346 --> 00:43:53,306
It's basically a web
app on the apple.com,


988
00:43:53,306 --> 00:43:55,046
iadworkbench.apple.com.


989
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:59,506
This is how you can manage
being an advertiser on iAd.


990
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:02,136
OK? You can create mobile ads.


991
00:44:02,446 --> 00:44:03,726
You can upload your own banners.


992
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,196
You can use built-in templates.


993
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:10,026
You can also use iProducer to
create your own iAd assets.


994
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:14,526
Once you've done that, you can
use this to reach the users


995
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,006
who are most likely to
actually download your app.


996
00:44:17,436 --> 00:44:19,516
iAd is an iOS advertising
platform.


997
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:22,366
You're going to reach a whole
bunch of users who are on iOS


998
00:44:22,366 --> 00:44:25,826
who are already using apps on
iOS and who are, therefore,


999
00:44:25,826 --> 00:44:29,526
highly likely to engage with the
ad that is advertising your app


1000
00:44:29,526 --> 00:44:30,656
and download your app.


1001
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:34,366
You can also manage your
campaign performance here.


1002
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:35,036
This is where you're going


1003
00:44:35,036 --> 00:44:37,106
to see how many people
have seen your ad,


1004
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:39,936
how the campaign is doing,
tap-through rates, etcetera,


1005
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:41,836
for your particular
advertising campaign.


1006
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:44,176
So that's Workbench.


1007
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:44,656
Again, there's going


1008
00:44:44,656 --> 00:44:46,826
to be another session tomorrow
going into more detail.


1009
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:50,106
Next important part to
talk about is some new APIs


1010
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,166
that we've got for
app attribution.


1011
00:44:52,686 --> 00:44:54,796
OK, what is app attribution?


1012
00:44:55,646 --> 00:44:58,806
App attribution allows you to
track app downloads of your app


1013
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,296
that originated from iAd.


1014
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:04,186
OK? This is going to let you
measure the effectiveness


1015
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:06,606
of your campaigns that you've
created in iAd Workbench


1016
00:45:06,606 --> 00:45:09,246
that you're running to
actually promote your app.


1017
00:45:09,446 --> 00:45:16,106
OK, the APIs were available
in iOS 7 - or iOS 7.1, rather.


1018
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:19,216
And we've enhanced them a
little bit in iOS 8 as well.


1019
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,736
So there's a new one in iOS 8.


1020
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:23,396
So what does the API
actually look like?


1021
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:24,166
It's very simple.


1022
00:45:24,296 --> 00:45:26,676
Again, you're going
to include iAd/iAd.h,


1023
00:45:26,676 --> 00:45:28,086
as everything starts
with for iAd.


1024
00:45:28,646 --> 00:45:32,316
And then you're going to
call ADClient sharedClient.


1025
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:35,726
And on that you're going to
call lookupAdConversionDetails.


1026
00:45:36,026 --> 00:45:40,366
OK? Inside that you can use
the two dates that are provided


1027
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,686
with completion handler
to determine whether


1028
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:44,926
or not this particular
installation


1029
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:46,826
of the app was due to iAd.


1030
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:49,526
OK? These dates are going
to give you two things.


1031
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:51,936
The first is the
app purchase date -


1032
00:45:51,936 --> 00:45:54,316
the date at which the user
actually made the purchase


1033
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:54,836
of this app.


1034
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:57,916
And then the date
of the impression,


1035
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:01,616
the date that the user saw and
interacted with the ad prior


1036
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:03,276
to them purchasing the app.


1037
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:07,756
OK? If both of these dates are
there and true, that's going


1038
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:09,046
to indicate to you that as far


1039
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:11,876
as iAd is concerned
this was a installation


1040
00:46:11,876 --> 00:46:13,556
of your app directly
attributable


1041
00:46:13,556 --> 00:46:14,926
to the user interacting with


1042
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:17,536
and seeing an iAd
promoting your app.


1043
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:24,426
It's very important to remember
that these dates are going


1044
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:27,946
to be nil if they are
not attributed to iAd.


1045
00:46:28,826 --> 00:46:31,936
They'll also be nil if the user
has Limit Ad Tracking enabled.


1046
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:33,246
So regardless of whether


1047
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:35,806
or not this is an
iAd-driven installation,


1048
00:46:36,156 --> 00:46:37,916
the user has Limit
Ad Tracking enabled;


1049
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:40,616
they don't want their ad
browsing data to be tracked


1050
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,816
or shown to various apps.


1051
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:43,836
These are going to be nil.


1052
00:46:43,836 --> 00:46:45,646
We're not going to give you
this information in those cases.


1053
00:46:45,646 --> 00:46:47,576
So you should be aware of that
if you're trying to use this


1054
00:46:47,576 --> 00:46:48,716
for any sort of analytics.


1055
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:52,546
In addition, you
want to avoid lookups


1056
00:46:52,546 --> 00:46:53,926
of this data on every launch.


1057
00:46:53,926 --> 00:46:56,046
It's probably very
tempting to add this


1058
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,886
to appDidFinishLaunching,
lookup your conversion details,


1059
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:00,456
set some state flag,
and do something


1060
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:01,806
on every single launch
on the app.


1061
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,336
Try to avoid doing that.


1062
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:06,136
There is some cost to
actually doing this lookup.


1063
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:08,836
You want to defer doing this
lookup until you actually need


1064
00:47:08,836 --> 00:47:11,196
to and then cache
the data afterward.


1065
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:14,356
OK, so that's app attribution.


1066
00:47:14,356 --> 00:47:15,976
The next thing we can talk


1067
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:18,876
about is the app
audience retargeting APIs.


1068
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,856
These are new APIs in iOS 8.


1069
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:24,986
So what is app audience
retargeting to begin with?


1070
00:47:25,186 --> 00:47:28,586
Audience retargeting allows you
to group the users of your app,


1071
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:32,686
that particular audience, into
various categories depending


1072
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:35,676
on their activity within your
app or things that you know


1073
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:37,766
about them from their
use of your app.


1074
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,836
This might be frequent
in-app purchases.


1075
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:45,116
It might be a very high
usage rate relative


1076
00:47:45,116 --> 00:47:46,426
to other users within your app.


1077
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:49,976
It might be dormant users, users
who used your app a while ago


1078
00:47:49,976 --> 00:47:51,456
but you haven't seen in a while.


1079
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:56,696
You can then use this
information to target new ads


1080
00:47:56,696 --> 00:48:01,086
in iAd Workbench directly at
specific subgroups of your users


1081
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:06,476
to reach specific audiences
within the users of your app.


1082
00:48:06,726 --> 00:48:09,516
Each group defines
what we call a segment.


1083
00:48:09,896 --> 00:48:11,156
That's terminology
that's going to come


1084
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:12,226
up in the next couple of slides.


1085
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,126
That's important to know.


1086
00:48:13,466 --> 00:48:15,696
A specific group of
your users is a -


1087
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:18,746
with a specific name
is a segment.


1088
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,586
So why would you
want to use this?


1089
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:25,756
Let's say you're a
game app developer.


1090
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:29,266
You want to promote the
new iAd version of your app


1091
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:31,006
to all your iPhone users.


1092
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:34,306
You want to go back and reach
those specific users and say,


1093
00:48:34,306 --> 00:48:37,876
"Hey, I've got a great
new iPad version of it.


1094
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:38,626
Come try it again.


1095
00:48:38,626 --> 00:48:40,946
Come back to this app,
maybe redownload it."


1096
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,316
If there's new features
that affect specific subsets


1097
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:49,056
of your app, you can use this
to reach those specific users.


1098
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:51,656
That's going to ensure that
the ads you create are going


1099
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:53,786
to reach precisely the
audience you're attempting


1100
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:58,426
to target with those ads.


1101
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:00,536
Similarly you can
reengage dormant users.


1102
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:02,206
If you've got users
that you haven't seen


1103
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:05,296
in a while you can craft a
message specifically designed


1104
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:07,206
to try to pull those
people back into your app


1105
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:09,906
to reengage those users who
may not have used your app


1106
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:10,486
in some time.


1107
00:49:12,696 --> 00:49:14,196
If you're a retail app instead,


1108
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:16,106
there's similar reasons
to use this.


1109
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:19,326
It can remind users who may
have abandoned a shopping cart


1110
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:22,486
in your app, segment those into
something, send them a message,


1111
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:24,296
"Hey, you abandoned
your shopping cart.


1112
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:26,816
Maybe you should come back
and reengage with this app.


1113
00:49:26,846 --> 00:49:28,556
Maybe you still want to
purchase those things."


1114
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:31,576
If you've got loyal
customers, maybe you want


1115
00:49:31,576 --> 00:49:32,536
to send them a special offer.


1116
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,686
Maybe you want to send them a
gift for being a loyal customer.


1117
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:36,666
You can do that with
an ad as well.


1118
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:41,296
You can retarget specific ads to
specific segments of your users.


1119
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:44,816
If they've - you
can group customers


1120
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,366
into specific categories based
on their previous purchases.


1121
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:49,856
You can promote sales based
on their previous purchases.


1122
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:53,146
All these are done by segmenting
those users into specific groups


1123
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:56,486
and recording that so
that you can reengage


1124
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:58,166
with those users
with specific ads.


1125
00:49:58,256 --> 00:49:59,976
So how does this actually work?


1126
00:50:00,046 --> 00:50:02,506
First thing you're going
to do is you're going to go


1127
00:50:02,506 --> 00:50:05,406
on iAd Workbench, and you're
going to create segments.


1128
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:07,586
And you're going to tell
iAd Workbench, "Hey,


1129
00:50:07,586 --> 00:50:09,756
I'm going to group these people
into 10 different segments.


1130
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:12,536
Please give me some segment
identifiers to use for that."


1131
00:50:12,816 --> 00:50:14,846
It's important to notice that
you do not create segment -


1132
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:17,816
specific segment identifiers;
iAd Workbench does instead,


1133
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:20,306
and this is partially
for privacy reasons.


1134
00:50:20,306 --> 00:50:22,656
We manage the specific
segment identifiers.


1135
00:50:23,556 --> 00:50:25,676
Once you've done that,
you're going to go ahead


1136
00:50:25,676 --> 00:50:27,956
and update your app and take
advantage of the new APIs,


1137
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:30,516
so you can actually
associate specific segments


1138
00:50:30,516 --> 00:50:31,936
with specific users.


1139
00:50:32,036 --> 00:50:33,136
And that goes up to the server


1140
00:50:33,136 --> 00:50:34,926
so we can actually
record that information.


1141
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,596
Once that's done, you go
back to iAd Workbench,


1142
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:41,376
and you create your
new Workbench campaign


1143
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:45,466
to retarget those customers
with some specific ad message.


1144
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:49,576
OK, so how do you
actually do this?


1145
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:51,216
Actually very simple
on the client side.


1146
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:52,986
You're going to include iAd.


1147
00:50:54,206 --> 00:50:56,386
You're going to create
an array of segments,


1148
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,646
and these are segments -


1149
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:00,486
the segment identifiers are
what you've already gotten


1150
00:51:00,486 --> 00:51:01,386
from Workbench.


1151
00:51:01,386 --> 00:51:03,966
If you attempt to send random
segment identifiers up to iAd,


1152
00:51:04,276 --> 00:51:05,506
we're just going to ignore them,


1153
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:07,026
so you want to make sure
you're using the ones


1154
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:09,696
that you've already created
and set up inside Workbench.


1155
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:13,346
So maybe you decided you know
Segment A is loyal users,


1156
00:51:13,346 --> 00:51:15,816
Segment B is frequent
purchases, and you want


1157
00:51:15,816 --> 00:51:18,316
to associate the current
user with those two segments.


1158
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:19,866
And you go ahead and
create a segment array


1159
00:51:19,866 --> 00:51:20,926
with those segments in it.


1160
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:24,226
And you're going to call
ADClient sharedClient,


1161
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:28,226
addClientToSegments,
replaceExisting.


1162
00:51:28,226 --> 00:51:31,496
This is by default with
replaceExisting:NO going


1163
00:51:31,496 --> 00:51:34,316
to add these segments
to the current user.


1164
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:37,126
If instead you'd like to
say, "Hey, these are all


1165
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,766
of the segments I'd like
to associate the user,"


1166
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:41,386
which might also allow
you to remove old segments


1167
00:51:41,386 --> 00:51:44,306
from the user, you can just
update that replaceExisting


1168
00:51:44,306 --> 00:51:47,056
to yes to just completely
replace the old set


1169
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:48,116
with the new set.


1170
00:51:50,456 --> 00:51:55,466
OK, so that's basically iAd
for promotion, the new APIs


1171
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:56,836
that we've added in iOS 8.


1172
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:58,526
So what did we learn?


1173
00:52:00,406 --> 00:52:02,696
First of all, there's some
best practices for using iAd.


1174
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:04,896
There are four different types
of banners that we've talked -


1175
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,526
four different types of ads
that we've talked about.


1176
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:07,116
There's a banner.


1177
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:08,446
There's an interstitial.


1178
00:52:09,016 --> 00:52:09,956
There's a medium rect.


1179
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:12,876
And there's a pre-roll, and
they all have their place.


1180
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:15,936
You want to take advantage
of the different ad formats


1181
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:19,086
that we've given to you,
think about where they belong


1182
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:22,306
in your app, and make sure
you use the appropriate ad


1183
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,706
for the appropriate context.


1184
00:52:24,086 --> 00:52:27,406
As part of that, consider the
user when you're placing ads.


1185
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:31,746
Yes, ads are very valuable
for generating revenue


1186
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:34,216
from your app, and iAd can
help a lot with doing that.


1187
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:39,596
But great revenue and great apps
start with great users as well.


1188
00:52:39,596 --> 00:52:41,566
If you're going to
alienate all of your users


1189
00:52:41,676 --> 00:52:44,696
by poor ad placement,
by poor ad choice,


1190
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:46,886
you're not actually going
to have a net win here.


1191
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:50,216
You want to really make sure
you have a user-centric focus


1192
00:52:50,426 --> 00:52:52,346
to where you're picking
to put ads


1193
00:52:52,346 --> 00:52:54,566
and which type you're
choosing to put there.


1194
00:52:56,916 --> 00:53:00,636
In addition, there's
a cycle here


1195
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,946
between monetization
and promotion.


1196
00:53:03,216 --> 00:53:06,496
OK? Optimize your ad's
performance to begin -


1197
00:53:06,496 --> 00:53:08,856
your app's ad performance
to begin with, that's going


1198
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:10,066
to generate revenue from it.


1199
00:53:10,976 --> 00:53:12,856
But don't forget to take
advantage of iAd Workbench


1200
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,646
and repromote your app.


1201
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:17,976
It's important to continue
to get new users for your app


1202
00:53:17,976 --> 00:53:20,276
if you want to continue to
get revenue from your app.


1203
00:53:20,886 --> 00:53:22,096
The two feed into each other.


1204
00:53:22,096 --> 00:53:24,156
You want to generate revenue;
you want to spend some


1205
00:53:24,156 --> 00:53:26,876
of your revenue to readvertise
your app and acquire new users.


1206
00:53:27,346 --> 00:53:32,026
OK? So those are some sort
of best practices for iAd.


1207
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,746
For more information
beyond this,


1208
00:53:34,816 --> 00:53:37,546
we've got Mark Malone is our
iAd Technologies Evangelist.


1209
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:39,366
You can reach him at
the email address above.


1210
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:42,996
There's an iAd Programming
Guide online along


1211
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:45,896
with the iOS STK
developer information.


1212
00:53:46,646 --> 00:53:48,906
There's some Apple developer
forums that we monitor.


1213
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:51,666
If you've got questions,
you and other developers,


1214
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,696
and us will be monitoring
those to answer questions,


1215
00:53:53,696 --> 00:53:54,526
hopefully help you out.


1216
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:58,336
There are a couple related
sessions here at WWDC.


1217
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,596
Unfortunately you already
missed "The New iTunes Connect,"


1218
00:54:00,596 --> 00:54:01,916
which talked a little
bit about iAd.


1219
00:54:02,116 --> 00:54:03,076
That was yesterday.


1220
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:04,256
You can watch the video.


1221
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:07,346
Tomorrow morning at 9:00 in
Nob Hill there's "What's New


1222
00:54:07,346 --> 00:54:08,886
in iAd Workbench,"
which is going to go


1223
00:54:08,886 --> 00:54:11,546
into a little bit more detail
about the app attribution


1224
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:13,456
and the audience segment
retargeting that I talked


1225
00:54:13,456 --> 00:54:15,286
about at the end of
this presentation.


1226
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:16,556
And that's it.


1227
00:54:16,826 --> 00:54:17,566
Thank you very much.


1228
00:54:17,566 --> 00:54:19,000
