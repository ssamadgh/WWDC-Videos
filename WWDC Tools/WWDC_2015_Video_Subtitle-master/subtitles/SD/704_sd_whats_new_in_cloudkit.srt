00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:29,856
[Applause]


2
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:31,686
>> OLIVIER BONNET: Good
afternoon and welcome


3
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:34,416
to Session 704 What's
New in CloudKit.


4
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,246
My name is Olivier.


5
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:39,006
I'm the Engineering Manager
for the iCloud Client teams.


6
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:44,656
So a year ago we introduced
CloudKits a brand new framework


7
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:48,476
for you as developers to
harness of the power of iCloud.


8
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:54,056
We built a number of
the iOS 8 new features


9
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:55,186
on top of CloudKits.


10
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:59,266
Most visibly iCloud Drive and
iCloud Photo Library were built


11
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:03,536
from the ground up on top of
CloudKit but Mail Drop, HomeKit,


12
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,226
Safari history syncing, and
call history syncing were also


13
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:08,056
using CloudKit.


14
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:12,416
So a year later,
what have we seen?


15
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:17,106
We have uploaded over
240 billion records.


16
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:22,426
We saved over 250 petabytes
of assets and that's coming


17
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:25,156
from over 300 million users.


18
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,326
So really, we couldn't
be happier


19
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:32,716
with how this has turned
out, with how reliable


20
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,566
and stable CloudKit
has been for us.


21
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:39,856
So this year, we're going to add
a couple more features to that.


22
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:44,006
Notes is now using
CloudKit on iOS,


23
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,716
and OS X to synchronize your
notes between your devices.


24
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,806
The new app we introduces
yesterday,


25
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:55,146
News is entirely built on
the CloudKit public database.


26
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:59,506
Even the WWDC app is now
using CloudKit this year.


27
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:02,276
And last but not
least iCloud Backup,


28
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:06,406
was ported in iOS
9 to use CloudKit.


29
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,636
So this is actually -- this
one is actually a bigger deal


30
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:12,306
than it seems because iCloud
Backup is our biggest service


31
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:16,396
in terms of number of users,
amount of data, and the number


32
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:19,796
of requests per seconds.


33
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,776
We've also heard some good
feedback from you as developers.


34
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:26,616
For instance, from Hipstamatic,
"With CloudKit, we were able


35
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,066
to focus on building our app,


36
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,036
and even squeeze
in a few extras."


37
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:33,036
So that is exactly
why we built CloudKit.


38
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:37,386
To enable you as developers to
focus on building great apps,


39
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:40,596
building awesome user
experience, without having


40
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:43,286
to set up a server, without
having to operate it,


41
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:46,486
without having to
be on call 24/7.


42
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:52,306
AgileBits is using CloudKit to
synchronize one password data.


43
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,326
They're happy with it.


44
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,086
Here's what they're saying:
"CloudKit is very fast,


45
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:59,786
efficient, and makes it easy to
detect and troubleshoot errors."


46
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:05,586
Again, that was one of our
design goals with CloudKit.


47
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:09,286
If there's an error in the
daemon, on the network,


48
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:12,356
or on the server side, we will
return that error to your app


49
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:15,786
and your app is in
charge of handling it,


50
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:19,126
retrying it, if it makes sense.


51
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:23,076
Last but not least, IconFactory:
"One of the best parts


52
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:26,236
about CloudKit is there's no
complicated sign-in process


53
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:26,846
or setup."


54
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,636
Again that was one of out goals.


55
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:34,406
Make it possible to enable
completely seamless user


56
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,726
experience, no account creation,


57
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:38,926
no password to enter
or remember.


58
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,496
In addition to this
good feedback,


59
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:45,096
we also heard some questions
from you as developers.


60
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,326
So last year, we
introduced CloudKit.


61
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:49,096
We said it was free with limits.


62
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,746
And so we get some questions
like, okay, what does it mean?


63
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,276
What if my app reached
the limits?


64
00:03:55,816 --> 00:04:00,316
How much will I have
to pay Apple?


65
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:03,126
Second question we got
immediately last year is like,


66
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,826
okay, but what about the web?


67
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,576
What if I have a web app
and I wanted to be able


68
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:12,966
to access the same data as
my iOS and OS X CloudKit app.


69
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,436
To talk about both of those,


70
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,156
I would like to hand
it over to Eric.


71
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,646
Eric is the manager for
the iCloud Server team.


72
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:25,586
[Applause].


73
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:26,636
>> ERIC KRUGLER: Thank you.


74
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:27,826
Well, thank you, Olivier.


75
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,536
It's terrific to be here
this afternoon to talk to you


76
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,166
about what's new in CloudKit.


77
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,786
Let's start by answering
that first question.


78
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:35,606
What does it cost?


79
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:39,226
We are going to look at CloudKit
usage and pricing but to get


80
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,136
into that, we first need


81
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:42,346
to understand the
CloudKit architecture.


82
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:46,556
So when you use CloudKit,
all of your data is stored


83
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,916
in your CloudKit container.


84
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,256
This is the place where
all of your data resides


85
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,596
and you can store that
data, in two different ways.


86
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:58,226
One is as a private database
and two is as a public database.


87
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:02,036
Now a private database is
the user's private data.


88
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:05,226
This example would be
the iCloud Photo Library.


89
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:08,586
All the photos that you
take are stored in CloudKit


90
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:11,336
and accessible by the user
and managed by the user,


91
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,046
and because it's the
user's private data it comes


92
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:17,186
out of the user's storage
quota, not the developer's.


93
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:19,946
Now when we look at
the public database,


94
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,146
this is application's
public data.


95
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:25,316
A great example of this
is the new News app


96
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,146
that we just announced
yesterday,


97
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:30,516
where all of those news articles
are actually distributed


98
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:33,716
to all the news applications
via CloudKit public database


99
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:37,016
and because it's the
application's public data this


100
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:39,436
comes out of the
developer's storage quota.


101
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:42,936
So when we talk about pricing
and we talk about usage,


102
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,976
we are really talking about
public database usage.


103
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:47,766
So let's see what that means.


104
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:51,666
For our public database
offering,


105
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,216
we have a free offering.


106
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:57,436
We also have a fee structure if
you exceed those free limits.


107
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,856
And we also have usage data.


108
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:03,956
Let's look at the free offering.


109
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:08,626
So you have to store assets in
the cloud, and we track that


110
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:11,066
and we give you ten
gigabytes to start.


111
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,996
So if you have no users, you
are just starting development,


112
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:14,966
10 gigs.


113
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,296
Now as your user
population grows,


114
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,496
as your application becomes more
popular, we are going to grow


115
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:24,256
with you and we are going to
add an additional 250 megs


116
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:27,176
for every single user that is
using your application for free


117
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:29,186
and we will grow that up


118
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:32,046
to an astonishing 1
petabyte of storage.


119
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:36,246
Likewise, for the database side,


120
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:38,716
where you store your record
data, we will start you


121
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:42,056
with 100 megs and we will
grow that at 2.5 megs per user


122
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:44,136
and we will go up to
10 terabytes for free.


123
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:48,956
Now in addition to storage,
we also have data transfer.


124
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:50,786
So as you're uploading


125
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:53,186
and downloading your assets
you are consuming bandwidth


126
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:56,336
and we will start
you with 2 gigabytes


127
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:59,106
of data transfer per
month in and out.


128
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,856
And like the others we will grow
that as you have more users.


129
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,066
So we will add an extra 50
megs per user per month.


130
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,996
And we will allow you to
grow up to 200 terabytes


131
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,936
of data transfer per
month all for free.


132
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,856
Now for database, it's
a little different.


133
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,106
We actually measure it on
a request per second basis.


134
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,716
So we are going to start you


135
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:22,976
at 40 requests per second,
which is very large.


136
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:25,486
And just like the
others, we will grow


137
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,486
with the number of users.


138
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,126
And we will do that
in increments


139
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:31,976
of 10 requests per second
for each 100,000 users


140
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:36,386
up to 400 requests per second
for free, and what's important


141
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,386
to note about the
request per second is


142
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:39,686
that it's actually
a throttle limit.


143
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,976
So if for some reason your
application hits these limits,


144
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:46,176
we will actually send you
back a throttling error back


145
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:47,926
to your client to tell
you you've hit the limits.


146
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:50,696
And then we will talk
in a bit about how


147
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,666
to make sure that
doesn't happen.


148
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:54,706
All right.


149
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,746
Now, if you do go
over those limits,


150
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,226
there is a way to pay for more.


151
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,216
And that's our public
database fees.


152
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,406
Now, this is over and above
what we give you for free.


153
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,476
So it's the incremental delta
between what you get for free,


154
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:07,706
and what you are using.


155
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,536
So for assets, it's $0.03
per gigabyte per month,


156
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,136
for database, $3.00
per gig per month.


157
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,066
On the transfer side,


158
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,416
for transferring
assets $0.10 per gig


159
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,886
and on the database
request rates,


160
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,946
we'll add an extra 10
requests per second for $100,


161
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,726
and so you can increment that
number up to get to the level


162
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:29,106
that allows your
application to work smoothly


163
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:30,266
if you hit the free limits.


164
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:35,726
And, of course, push is free.


165
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:40,166
Okay? So now let's
take a look at a demo


166
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:42,285
of the CloudKit calculator.


167
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:46,196
This is on
developer.apple.com/cloudkit.


168
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:47,916
You can play around with
this if you haven't already.


169
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:50,526
I'm going to invite
Ramiro Calvo to help drive,


170
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:52,696
because apparently I can drive
and talk at the same time.


171
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:57,046
And he's going to help
us walk through this.


172
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:00,916
If you go to the calculator,
you notice that right now,


173
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:04,366
we have zero active users.


174
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:10,516
Okay? And the numbers that you
see beneath it tell you how much


175
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,876
storage we are getting
to you for free.


176
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,996
For start, this matches
what we just talked about.


177
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:15,486
There's 10 gigs of
asset storage,


178
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:19,236
100 megs of database storage, 2
gigs of data transfer per month,


179
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,786
and 40 requests per second.


180
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,666
Now let's say my
application starts taking off


181
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,986
and I have 100,000 users.


182
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:27,716
So we're going to
grow that to 100,000,


183
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:30,496
and you will notice we gave
you a lot more storage,


184
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:33,386
and if you look below
at the bottom there,


185
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:35,946
and Ramiro maybe you can scroll
up a little bit, you're going


186
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:41,186
to notice that the
cost is actually $0.


187
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,316
Ramiro is it possible to
scroll it up a little bit.


188
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:43,636
Thank you.


189
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,626
Okay? So we have $0 cost.


190
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,946
Now let's say we go up
to half a million users.


191
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,736
Okay? Now, once again we
have a lot of storage.


192
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:58,596
Now we are up to 125 terabytes.


193
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:02,566
We're still growing and the
cost to you is still zero.


194
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:04,856
Let's take it to
a million users.


195
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,176
Okay? So now we got a
lot of users in here.


196
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,226
We got a lot of storage.


197
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:12,586
We are up to 250
terabytes of data.


198
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,126
Lots of requests per second.


199
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:15,916
It's still free.


200
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,016
Let's take it to
4 million users.


201
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:22,066
Okay. So now we are at 4
million users and you are going


202
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,346
to see some very
large numbers here.


203
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:27,496
We are up to the petabyte
of storage, 10 terabytes


204
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:31,376
of database storage,
200 terabytes per month


205
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,996
of data transfer,
this is a lot of data,


206
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:36,126
and all of this still
costs you nothing.


207
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,126
Now if you recall from
the pricing slide,


208
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,086
at some point, we hit a limit.


209
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:42,776
And that limit looks
about right here.


210
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,426
You got about a petabyte
of storage.


211
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,026
That's what we said was
the max you can get to.


212
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:49,716
So, as we add more users then
there must be some costs.


213
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,036
Let's take it to
5 million users.


214
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:56,696
And the cost here is --
well, it's still free.


215
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,206
So what's going on here?


216
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:03,986
Well, if your application on
average uses less per user


217
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,106
that we give you, it
still costs you nothing.


218
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:07,826
And because it's an average,


219
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,316
that means that some users
may use more than the average,


220
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,666
and some may use less and
that's perfectly fine.


221
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,146
It still costs you nothing.


222
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:16,576
So we could take this all the
way up to 10 million here,


223
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:20,186
and demonstrate that it still
costs you nothing, all right?


224
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,776
If you just architect your
application correctly to stay


225
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:25,696
within the free limits
that we give you.


226
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:26,516
All right?


227
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,556
So that's how we calculate
things, use the calculator


228
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,606
if you would like
more information.


229
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:31,866
Thanks Ramiro.


230
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:39,756
[Applause]


231
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:40,906
All right.


232
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,106
The next question is how do
I know how much I'm using?


233
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:45,646
The CloudKit Dashboard
is the place


234
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:46,856
where we put this information.


235
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,516
The Dashboard is a web
application that you get


236
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:52,076
to at developer.apple.com.


237
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,146
It's a place that you get
to look at your container


238
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:58,596
and you get to do things like
manage your record types,


239
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,066
manage whether they are in
development or production,


240
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,906
and we have added some
new functionality.


241
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:07,556
So if you take a look
at what we've added,


242
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,356
there's a new section
called Usage.


243
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,586
And you can go there
and take a look


244
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:15,036
at how your application
container is performing.


245
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,036
If we drill in, we have a couple


246
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,176
of different ways
to look at the data.


247
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,306
We can look at it at a daily
level or a monthly level.


248
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:28,376
And if you look at the daily
information, the very top thing


249
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,636
on the graphs is
the number of users


250
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:31,936
and this is really important


251
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:34,906
because we calculate how
much free stuff we give you,


252
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,066
based on the numbers you have.


253
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:37,396
So you want to look
at that first.


254
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:40,066
Now, you'll also
notice on the right,


255
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,076
you have some dashed
lines over this


256
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,916
because what we are giving you
is two months worth of data,


257
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:46,956
the prior month and
the current month.


258
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,826
The current month,
depending on where you are at,


259
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,376
some of that is going
to be a forecast.


260
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,786
And we're going to
forecast that for you based


261
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:55,136
on the prior activity
of your container.


262
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,616
Now, below this,
is another graph,


263
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,866
which shows our requests
per second and day by day,


264
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,686
we show you what the peak
request per second we're seeing


265
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:04,656
on any given day is.


266
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:09,836
Now you can also select monthly
and if you choose monthly,


267
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:12,686
you're going to get a
12-month view month by month


268
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,496
of the activity of
your application,


269
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,246
and the current month
is typically going to be


270
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,966
in a forecast where
it shows a dashed line


271
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,716
and basically what we
expect it's going to be


272
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:22,516
for the current month.


273
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,846
Now, let's scroll down to look
at a couple of other graphs.


274
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:29,586
Here's database storage,
as well as asset storage.


275
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,936
And you'll notice
something different here.


276
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,006
You will see two lines.


277
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,656
There's a red line on top
and a yellow line just below.


278
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:39,876
The red line represents
the amount of free storage


279
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:40,646
that we are giving you.


280
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:44,376
And the yellow line represents
how much you are actually using.


281
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,256
So the game all of you
guys get to play is how


282
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:50,766
to keep the yellow line
beneath the red line, right?


283
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:53,486
The way that you can actually
see this information is


284
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:56,586
by clicking over here on
the section on the right


285
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,806
where the quota box is.


286
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:58,856
It's off by default.


287
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,116
You can just turn
it on if you like.


288
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:02,556
The reason it is off by
default is because we give you


289
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:05,966
so much free storage, if you
click that, the scale changes


290
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,766
and basically your usage looks
like a flat line relative


291
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,146
to the amount of free
storage that we give you.


292
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,346
So please go ahead
and try that out.


293
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:16,066
So the CloudKit Dashboard
provides two things.


294
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:19,986
It's a new section to
keep track of usage data


295
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,796
and also give you
the free limits.


296
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:27,516
And it's available now in beta
release at developer.apple.com.


297
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:28,756
So if you already
have a container,


298
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:31,476
you can go there today and
you can see the usage data


299
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:32,856
on the Dashboard.


300
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:39,396
All right.


301
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,916
The second question that
was asked is what about web?


302
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:44,146
Well, I'm pleased
to introduce you


303
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:46,886
to the new CloudKit
Web Services.


304
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,076
This is the way --


305
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:54,556
[Applause].


306
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:55,286
Yeah, all right!


307
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,866
This is the way that you
can take your amazing iOS


308
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,576
and OS X applications and you
can extend them to the web.


309
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:02,546
So how does this work?


310
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,716
Well, first lets talk
about the features.


311
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:09,016
You get a full CloudKit
API via JSON and HTTPS,


312
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,346
we also provide CloudKit
JS Library


313
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,806
which is absolutely the best way


314
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,696
to quickly create
web applications,


315
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,126
and we provide Web Sign in
with Apple ID is the way


316
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,606
that your users will
authenticate


317
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,566
when they use your web app.


318
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,566
Now, how does this work?


319
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:30,116
If you look today, you'll
see your application running


320
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:32,146
on iOS and OS X.


321
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:34,076
It interacts with
CloudKit the framework,


322
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:36,946
which behind the scenes talks
to our CloudKit servers.


323
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:42,186
What we have introduced
today is the ability for you


324
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,886
to create your own
web application,


325
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:47,896
running in a web browser and
talking over JSON and HTTPS,


326
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:51,666
to our CloudKit Web Services
which lets you then talk


327
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,256
to the same exact
CloudKit servers


328
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:57,526
that your native applications
are talking to on iOS and OS X.


329
00:15:57,526 --> 00:16:00,726
Now, it's important to
understand about the JSON


330
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,026
and the HTTPS piece of this,
it's just a specification.


331
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:05,576
There's no code.


332
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,006
Effectively, it's up to
you as a developer to look


333
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,116
at that specification.


334
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:12,526
You get to construct your own
end points, hitting endpoints.


335
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:16,216
You get to create your URLs and
construct your JSONs that goes


336
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:19,426
in the bodies that go up in
a request, you get back JSON


337
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:22,436
in responses, you parse that,
you deal with asset uploads


338
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,766
and downloads, retry
logic and on and on.


339
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:28,846
But a much better way to do
this is using the CloudKit


340
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,296
JS framework.


341
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:34,836
CloudKit JS gives you a
JavaScript API that you can use


342
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:38,126
that shields you from all
the complexities of the HTTPS


343
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,676
and JSON protocol
that sits behind it.


344
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,856
And you can use either one,
but you are probably crazy


345
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:44,656
if you go the other route.


346
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,806
So please use CloudKit JS.


347
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,206
So what does this give you?


348
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,026
Well all right, it
gives you full public


349
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,436
and private database access.


350
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:54,846
It gives you all those
record applications.


351
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,266
It lets you upload
and download assets.


352
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:59,566
It lets you execute queries.


353
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:03,086
It even lets you do
subscriptions and notifications,


354
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:06,976
which means that I can actually
get an asynchronous event


355
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,726
into my web application,
just like you get pushes


356
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:12,406
to tell you something has
changed or to notify you


357
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:14,476
of some other event,
so you don't have


358
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:16,796
to have users hitting the
refresh button or pulling


359
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:17,896
from your web application.


360
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,586
It also has user
discoverability,


361
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:23,876
and it has the ability to answer
the question what's changed


362
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,695
since within custom zones
which gives you sync semantics.


363
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,336
In short, what this gives
you is full compatibility


364
00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:32,806
and capability as what you get


365
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:40,316
on the native CloudKit
on iOS and OS X.


366
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:44,896
Now, CloudKit JS, as I mentioned
before is the absolute best way


367
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,196
to develop web applications.


368
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:47,246
It's a JavaScript API.


369
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,756
It matches the native
CloudKit API as much


370
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:52,746
as you can make JavaScript
match Objective-C,


371
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:54,456
but you know we did our
best, it's pretty close.


372
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,566
There's no intermediate servers.


373
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,316
So you can create your
JavaScript application


374
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:02,266
and you can talk directly
to the CloudKit, you know --


375
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:06,536
the CloudKit Web Service behind
the scenes and you don't have


376
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:08,606
to run your own servers
or anything in the middle


377
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:12,236
and it's how we built
the new Notes web app


378
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,606
that you saw demonstrated
the other day.


379
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:20,966
And what I would like to do is
have Ramiro Calvo join me again.


380
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,146
We're going to give you a demo


381
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,836
of the new Notes web app
based on CloudKit JS.


382
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,106
All right.


383
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:35,576
So we are going to
start at icloud.com.


384
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:36,536
This is our spring board.


385
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,326
There's a bunch of web
apps sitting here already.


386
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:42,006
You'll notice some familiar ones
we have Photos and iCloud Drive.


387
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:43,466
Those are two applications


388
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,626
that already exist
on top of CloudKit.


389
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:50,316
And with iOS 9, the new Notes
application is also built


390
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,216
on CloudKit.


391
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:54,976
And so we've created a new web
application that sits on top


392
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,016
of CloudKit, and
gives all of those --


393
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:59,846
that rich capability that you
saw demonstrated at the keynote.


394
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:01,906
So Ramiro will click in.


395
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:02,846
Here's the web app.


396
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:05,706
You're going to see some
great content in here.


397
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,016
You see images.


398
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,016
You can do videos.


399
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,606
There's check boxes.


400
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:12,196
All of these things are
available in the new Notes app


401
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,986
and they are just CloudKit
assets and records.


402
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:18,846
Okay? So what we are going to do
now is create a brand new node.


403
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:21,986
And since we are at the
developers conference,


404
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,476
we should probably
have a what to do


405
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,636
at the developers
conference while we are here.


406
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,876
So let's start out
with maybe one


407
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,436
of the more important
things, which is we need


408
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,036
to make sure we attend
all the after parties.


409
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:38,286
Let's get that one on the list.


410
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:41,716
Now after we get done with
attending the after parties,


411
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:46,586
we really need to go to
developer.apple.com/cloudkit


412
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,386
and take a look at all
the amazing documentation,


413
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,336
including this amazing
presentation,


414
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:54,156
where you are going to be
able to find information,


415
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,936
documentation and everything
about CloudKit itself as well


416
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:58,916
as the new CloudKit
Web Services.


417
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,316
Once we get through that,
we should really go off


418
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:05,956
and create our first
CloudKit web application.


419
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:11,346
And once we create that, well,
we should basically move on


420
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,206
and do our best to try
to hit those free limits


421
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:15,656
and that might actually
take a while.


422
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:17,976
So I don't think we
will check that one off.


423
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,966
But I have attended
at least one party.


424
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:24,256
So I think we can check
that first one off, Ramiro.


425
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,426
And complete this
web experience.


426
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:30,716
Now, let's go over to
iOS, which is an iPad,


427
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:33,546
running the new Notes
application.


428
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,106
We will open this up.


429
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:39,286
And you will see that same
kitchen remodel project


430
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:40,116
as we saw before.


431
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:42,956
And here's our new things to
do at WWDC that we just typed.


432
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:44,736
It showed up automatically.


433
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:46,086
It's the same data, right?


434
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:47,766
It's just that we have
a web interface to it,


435
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:50,536
where you can have your
native iOS interface to it.


436
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:53,786
Now, we will make a few
more changes in here.


437
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,576
I have already gone to
developer.apple.com.


438
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:59,976
Ramiro you have clearly
developed an amazing CloudKit


439
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:04,136
web app with the Notes app
and why don't we now go back


440
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:06,156
and take a look at the web


441
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:08,976
and see what happens,
you know, over there.


442
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:11,516
Now, if all things happen,


443
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:12,836
you will notice everything
got checked.


444
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,156
That was, again,


445
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,256
that notification
experience I talked about.


446
00:21:16,686 --> 00:21:19,556
The notification, push
notification happened.


447
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,916
The web application
picked that up,


448
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:24,466
and automatically updated itself
and showed you the changes.


449
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:28,156
And that's the new Notes
web app that's available


450
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,916
on iOS 9 and icloud.com.


451
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:30,946
Thanks Ramiro.


452
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:41,496
[Applause]


453
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,416
>> ERIC KRUGLER: Now,
if your users are going


454
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:45,156
to use the application,
they have to sign in.


455
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:48,336
And so we are going to jump
right in to taking a look


456
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:50,276
at what that might look like
in your web application.


457
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,396
So, first, you need
some sort of a button


458
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,956
to ask the user to sign in.


459
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:55,866
This is your UI.


460
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:00,806
Now when the user clicks this,
a new browser window is going


461
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:03,366
to pop up and this
browser window is owned


462
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:04,676
and managed by Apple.


463
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,686
And this is because the ID
and password is only exchanged


464
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:09,836
between the user and Apple.


465
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,416
The developer never sees this.


466
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:14,566
And there's a few other
things that show up further


467
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,106
down on the login page.


468
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,396
So first, there's
"Keep me signed in."


469
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,046
So the user can opt in to
say I want to stay signed


470
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,076
in for up to two weeks.


471
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,876
There's a "Forgot
Apple ID or password?"


472
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:31,736
So if the user has
forgotten their ID,


473
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:34,536
we'll manage the whole
flow of helping them


474
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,866
to remember their
password or reset it.


475
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:41,206
And finally, if the user
is brand new to, you know,


476
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,766
the Apple ecosystem, they
don't have an Apple ID at all,


477
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,666
they can create an Apple
ID right here in the flow


478
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,296
and they will get
an Apple account


479
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:49,646
that they can then
use immediately


480
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:50,576
with your application.


481
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:57,586
So the CloudKit Web Service
offering includes iCloud


482
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,016
web-only accounts what I just
described, which offers 1 gig


483
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,716
of free storage for
private database usage.


484
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,706
And if that same user then
goes to iOS or OS X and sets


485
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,926
up their account there,
it automatically upgrades


486
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,916
to the 5 gig iCloud
account immediately.


487
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:20,816
Public database usage is the
same for iOS, OS X and web.


488
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,816
There's no difference,
so a request made


489
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,496
on the web is the
same as a request made


490
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:26,386
on your phone or on your Mac.


491
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,036
Storage is the same way.


492
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:32,176
So when you go to the storage
areas or the usage information


493
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:34,266
on the Dashboard,
there's no distinction.


494
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:35,296
It's all put together.


495
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:41,966
We do require a comparable
application for iOS or OS X.


496
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:45,856
The purpose of the Web Services
is to take your amazing iOS


497
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:48,406
and OS X applications and
extend them to the web.


498
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:52,926
And it's available now in beta


499
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:55,836
for development,
releasing with iOS 9.


500
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:00,296
And that's it for
CloudKit Web Services.


501
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:03,106
What I would like to do is
ask Olivier to come back


502
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,486
and close out the session.


503
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:04,976
Thank you very much.


504
00:24:05,516 --> 00:24:11,446
[Applause].


505
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:12,946
>> OLIVIER BONNET: Thank
you very much, Eric.


506
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,636
So that's it.


507
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:18,766
We are very excited to see
what kind of application,


508
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:21,196
what kind of amazing
ideas you guys will build


509
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:23,656
on top of CloudKits.


510
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:27,586
As Eric mentioned, we have
new web page developer


511
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,406
at apple.com/cloudkit.


512
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:33,276
It aggregates all the data we
have and all the documentation,


513
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:36,776
the reference library, the
simple code we have on CloudKit,


514
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:41,016
both the new server, web APIs,
and the client framework.


515
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,536
In addition to the
usual technical support,


516
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:46,886
and forums, URLs.


517
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:52,116
If all of those fail, you
can email cloudkit@apple.com


518
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,206
for general inquiries.


519
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:57,626
We have two more
sessions this week.


520
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:01,066
The first one is tomorrow
and we will do a deep dive


521
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,966
on the CloudKit JS and
the Web Services API.


522
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:09,846
And then we have on Thursday
at 4:30, we have CloudKit Tips


523
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:14,656
and Tricks session, where
we'll do a best practices,


524
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:18,076
do's and don'ts and
as well a couple


525
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:22,466
of nice improvements we made
to the client's framework


526
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:25,446
in iOS 9, and OS X El Capitan.


527
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:30,786
We have a number of labs
during the rest of the week.


528
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:33,766
On Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday at 9:00,


529
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,116
we'll have client engineers.


530
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,356
We will have server engineers.


531
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:40,966
I promise some of them
will even be awake at 9:00.


532
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:43,796
Please come and with your
questions, with your ideas.


533
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,726
We're happy to talk about
data mall, about what type


534
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:49,546
of apps you guys have in mind,


535
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:51,766
either using public
or private databases.


536
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,036
Thank you very much.


537
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:54,976

538
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:58,500
