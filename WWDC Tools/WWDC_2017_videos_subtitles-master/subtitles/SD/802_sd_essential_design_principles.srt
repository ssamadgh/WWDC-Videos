1
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:29,976
>> Hello everybody.


2
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:34,726
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:36,266
>> My name is Mike Stern.


4
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:38,056
I manage the Design Evangelism


5
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:39,836
Team at Apple, and it is my


6
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:41,506
honor to be with you today to


7
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:42,416
talk about design.


8
00:00:44,036 --> 00:00:46,226
Now, at Apple, we often use the


9
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,966
term human interface to describe


10
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,546
what might otherwise be called


11
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:51,646
user interface.


12
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:55,216
Human interface is an uncommon,


13
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:58,056
not widely used term, but it has


14
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:01,176
a really long history at Apple.


15
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:02,916
Our design documentation, this


16
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,245
is the newly redesigned macOS


17
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,816
HIG, it is called the Human


18
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:09,176
Interface Guidelines.


19
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:12,886
This document goes all the way


20
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:17,036
back to 1978, a full 15 years


21
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:18,536
before I was even born.


22
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:19,756
I'm just kidding.


23
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:20,646
I'm old [laughter].


24
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:24,606
The word user can have a


25
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:27,126
clinical or anonymizing effect.


26
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:29,976
It narrowly defines people in


27
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,576
relation to the interface.


28
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:34,916
Human evokes a much more nuance


29
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,896
picture of who it is that we are


30
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,796
designing for.


31
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,126
If I say I'm only human, it is


32
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:41,786
to acknowledge that I have


33
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,906
imperfections, and I have


34
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:44,596
shortcomings.


35
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,846
I might fall short of your


36
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:46,996
expectations of me.


37
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:48,476
Hopefully not right now.


38
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,596
But the word human is also how


39
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:54,176
we express our highest and most


40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,336
noble qualities.


41
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,186
When you acknowledge someone's


42
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,486
humanity, you're recognizing


43
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:01,396
their kindness, their


44
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:04,516
compassion, their generosity and


45
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:06,286
goodness.


46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,045
Designing an interface is


47
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:09,776
fundamentally about serving


48
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:10,925
other human beings.


49
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:12,906
The goal isn't to make a


50
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:14,146
beautiful app, or a


51
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:16,476
well-organized app, or a simple


52
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:17,646
app or a focused app.


53
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:19,916
Those things are all really


54
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,556
important, but they're not the


55
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,406
real goal.


56
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:26,056
The real goal is about serving


57
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,246
the human beings or positively


58
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,926
affecting the lives of the


59
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:31,876
people who use the apps that you


60
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:32,206
make.


61
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:35,296
The only thing that really


62
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,126
matters is how well your app


63
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:39,586
satisfies the emotional and


64
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,716
practical needs of the people


65
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:42,786
you are designing for.


66
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:46,666
We have the need for safety and


67
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,616
predictability.


68
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:49,856
We have a need for knowledge,


69
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,276
for meaning, and understanding.


70
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,206
We have a need to accomplish


71
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:58,106
tasks, to achieve our personal


72
00:02:58,456 --> 00:02:59,956
and professional goals.


73
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:02,446
And we have the need to


74
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:05,256
experience beauty and joy.


75
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,946
Well-designed apps should


76
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,176
provide these things.


77
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:13,256
Well-designed apps make it easy


78
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:15,046
for people to predict the


79
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,866
consequences that their actions


80
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,416
will have.


81
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:20,646
They feel stable, solid,


82
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:22,046
trustworthy.


83
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:24,346
They help people to make


84
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,466
informed choices by providing


85
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,326
information that is clear and


86
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:28,936
helpful.


87
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:31,076
They have streamlined and


88
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,506
simplified workflows, so that


89
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,236
people can effectively and


90
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,426
efficiently accomplish their


91
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,026
tasks.


92
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,556
And they should have an


93
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,516
aesthetically pleasing,


94
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:45,586
enjoyable, and even delightful


95
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,596
experience.


96
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,516
Using apps that provides these


97
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,976
qualities is so gratifying, so


98
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,796
satisfying, you can tell that


99
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:55,196
the people who made the app


100
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:58,456
fully considered your needs.


101
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,076
You sense all the time and all


102
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,006
the effort that went into


103
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:04,056
figuring out how to help you get


104
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:05,736
things done quickly and


105
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:06,506
successfully.


106
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:08,436
Everything is there for a


107
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:08,886
purpose.


108
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,186
Everything is understandable.


109
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,116
It just feels so human.


110
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:18,625
When an app makes us feel this


111
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,836
way, we sense the humanity of


112
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:23,396
the people who designed it.


113
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,506
So how does the design of your


114
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:28,396
app accomplish this?


115
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,276
Now, when we talk about design,


116
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:34,296
we often focus on technique and


117
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:34,946
process.


118
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:36,906
And while these are important


119
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,776
considerations, they don't lead


120
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:39,806
to great designs.


121
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:41,886
At least not on their own.


122
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,586
Great designs are guided by a


123
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,006
deeper understanding about what


124
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:49,256
design is, at a more


125
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:52,626
fundamental, more human level.


126
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:56,206
This is what design principles


127
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,096
offer us.


128
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:00,646
They express core truths about


129
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,446
how we perceive the world around


130
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:02,776
us.


131
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:05,636
How we process information, how


132
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,656
we make decisions, and how we


133
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:08,326
communicate.


134
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:12,396
These truths are universal and


135
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,046
timeless.


136
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,026
They apply to all kinds of


137
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,276
graphic design.


138
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:19,166
Graphic design architecture,


139
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:21,386
interior design, retail design,


140
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:22,506
landscape design, landscape


141
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,196
design, automotive design, I


142
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,486
think I said landscape twice,


143
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,706
and every other type of design.


144
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,696
Design principles don't tell us


145
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,356
how to do specific things in our


146
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:35,966
design, they tell us why we


147
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,066
should do those things.


148
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,076
They serve as the foundation


149
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,956
upon which great designs are


150
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:43,236
built.


151
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,526
This session is about sharing


152
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,576
those principles with you.


153
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,276
Now, some of the things I'll


154
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,226
share today might seem kind of


155
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:56,216
basic or obvious.


156
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,796
But the most profound things are


157
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:00,896
often the simplest.


158
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,456
I've been designing for over 20


159
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:03,936
years.


160
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,666
I've been fortunate enough to


161
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,766
have worked with many brilliant


162
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,726
designers, both at Apple and in


163
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:09,776
the developer community.


164
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,066
I've had in-depth discussions


165
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,166
about a wide range of


166
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,826
interaction design challenges


167
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:17,676
across a full spectrum of apps


168
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,316
and games with people from


169
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:20,176
across the globe.


170
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,846
And in all of those experiences,


171
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,666
I'm constantly reminded, I


172
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,926
constantly return to just how


173
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,356
clarifying it is to evaluate a


174
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,406
design against the core


175
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,396
principles that we are about to


176
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:33,826
explore.


177
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:38,946
Okay. So, because design


178
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,066
principles are universal, I


179
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,246
thought it would be fun for us


180
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:43,966
to explore how these design


181
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,436
principles shape our experiences


182
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,406
in the real world.


183
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,856
Now, there really is no better


184
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,516
way to explore the real world


185
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,276
than to travel.


186
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:55,436
So, with that in mind, I thought


187
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,216
we would all go on a little trip


188
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:57,566
together.


189
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,046
Now, it took quite a bit of


190
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:02,596
persuading, but we managed to


191
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,126
allocate a portion of the


192
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:06,286
evangelism team's travel budget


193
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:08,366
to buy each one of you here


194
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,186
today a ticket to Hawaii.


195
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,826
What? Right?


196
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,356
That's pretty awesome.


197
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,766
Sandy beaches, rainforests,


198
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:19,776
tropical drinks.


199
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:21,556
Sounds pretty great, right?


200
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:23,286
Okay who is down?


201
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:23,976
Who wants to go on this trip?


202
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,206
[Applause and cheering] Yeah?


203
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:27,546
All right.


204
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,236
Let's go. Now, our journey to


205
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:31,856
lovely Hawaii is going to begin


206
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,726
somewhere slightly less lovely,


207
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:35,056
at the airport.


208
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:37,626
As we approach the airport, we


209
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,236
are going to see all sorts of


210
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:39,906
signs.


211
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,656
At first, we see signs about how


212
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:44,096
to get to our terminal.


213
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:47,216
Then we see signs that provide


214
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,706
more specific information about


215
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:49,916
what's at each terminal, and


216
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:51,886
after we find our terminal and


217
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,096
park, we head into the terminal,


218
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,946
and then we get directions to


219
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:56,446
our gate.


220
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,426
And once we get to our gate, we


221
00:07:58,426 --> 00:07:59,226
are going to know we're in the


222
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,826
right place, because there is a


223
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,736
big old sign telling us so.


224
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,436
And if we are in the wrong


225
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:05,876
place, or if our flight was


226
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,486
moved, we get directions to


227
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,396
nearby gates.


228
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:11,796
And in case there is an


229
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,026
emergency or we just want to


230
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,416
leave, nearby exits are clearly


231
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:16,716
marked.


232
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,646
The system of signs that we


233
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:21,446
followed is what is called a


234
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:22,606
wayfinding system.


235
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:25,746
Wayfinding systems help people


236
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,936
to navigate complex environments


237
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:29,616
quickly and successfully.


238
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:31,486
They are critical for helping


239
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:33,816
people feel oriented and safe.


240
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,736
People at airports are tired,


241
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,785
they're jet-lagged, they're in a


242
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,395
rush, they're stressed out.


243
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,535
So airports need to think really


244
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,236
deeply about wayfinding.


245
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:48,066
Good wayfinding systems offer a


246
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,096
comprehensive and understandable


247
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,156
list of general locations that


248
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:54,186
people can visit.


249
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,116
They provide needed detail about


250
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,496
what's in those locations.


251
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,126
They are highly contextual.


252
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:02,836
They become increasingly


253
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:04,936
specific as we navigate deeper


254
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:06,256
and deeper into the system.


255
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,436
They help people to orient


256
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:09,796
themselves by clearly


257
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:10,816
highlighting their current


258
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,646
location relative to other


259
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:13,466
locations.


260
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,486
And they provide a clear exit


261
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:16,626
path.


262
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:20,006
It's so comforting to know that


263
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,906
you can return to a place that


264
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,996
is more familiar and start over.


265
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:28,016
Wayfinding helps us to feel safe


266
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:30,226
by answering really basic


267
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:33,136
questions like: where am I?


268
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,126
Where can I go?


269
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,576
What will I find when I get


270
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:37,856
there?


271
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:39,616
What's nearby?


272
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:41,866
And how do I get out?


273
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,626
Without answers to questions


274
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,396
like these, we'd be lost.


275
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,366
Now, your app's interface is


276
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,066
really just one big old


277
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,186
wayfinding system.


278
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,176
The navigation bar, the content


279
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,446
area, the tab bar, they're all


280
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:56,636
just tools for providing


281
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,186
wayfinding in your app.


282
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,366
The navigation bar title and


283
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,106
selected tab bar item lets


284
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:02,966
people know where they are.


285
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,056
Tab bar in content areas lets


286
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,276
people know where they can go


287
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:08,056
and what's nearby.


288
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:11,056
Simply rendered and recognizable


289
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:12,326
tab bar glyphs and


290
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:14,966
understandable labels suggest to


291
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,716
people what they will find when


292
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,286
they get there.


293
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,776
And back buttons offer an exit


294
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:21,906
route, and can help people to


295
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,646
identify what area of the app


296
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:24,206
that they're in.


297
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,966
Now every screen in your app


298
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,786
should answer all of these


299
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,486
questions, or else people will


300
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,286
feel lost.


301
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,176
So go through your app.


302
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,836
Go one screen at a time, and ask


303
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,306
yourself, how well is each


304
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,506
screen answering these


305
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,026
questions?


306
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,806
Does every screen help people to


307
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:44,646
know where they are?


308
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:46,856
Does every screen help provide


309
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,846
options to people to tell them


310
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:49,766
where else they can go?


311
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,406
If some screens aren't answering


312
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:54,656
those questions clearly, then


313
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:55,966
there is some work to be done.


314
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,646
All right.


315
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,366
So we have a flight to catch.


316
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:01,826
Paradise awaits.


317
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,696
Wow. That was a quick flight.


318
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:07,056
If only they were all so quick.


319
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,506
So we have arrived in paradise,


320
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:12,556
and it's time to pick up our car


321
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:13,676
and head to the hotel.


322
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,256
What a sweet car it is.


323
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,386
It has got a sweet candy red


324
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,146
paint job.


325
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:20,386
Check out those rims.


326
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,606
Looks like it will do zero to 60


327
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:25,796
in like 10 or maybe 11 seconds.


328
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:27,746
It is a pretty small car.


329
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,226
If I were you, I would yell out


330
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:30,416
shotgun right now.


331
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:32,596
>> Shotgun!


332
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:33,936
>> [Laughs] All right, all


333
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,086
joking aside, cars are actually


334
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:36,956
quite dangerous.


335
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,716
The fact that we let people


336
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,076
drive around two-ton metal


337
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,736
objects at high velocities is


338
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:42,796
kind of ludicrous.


339
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,866
Especially when those people


340
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,876
could be tired and navigating


341
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:48,056
unfamiliar roads.


342
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,386
Now, because of the inherent


343
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:52,986
danger of driving a vehicle, car


344
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:54,326
manufacturers have to think


345
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,336
carefully about the design of


346
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,006
interiors.


347
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,916
Safety is a primary


348
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,796
consideration.


349
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:01,996
And so they're a great way for


350
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,396
us to learn about the design


351
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,966
principle of feedback.


352
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:08,146
Feedback helps us to operate


353
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,356
cars confidently and safely.


354
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:12,886
Feedback helps us to anticipate


355
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:14,776
problems that might cause the


356
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,756
car to stop functioning properly


357
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,536
or to stop moving all together.


358
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:21,466
Our vacation definitely won't be


359
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,186
very fun if that happens.


360
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,706
Now, cars provide various forms


361
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:26,126
of feedback.


362
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,036
There is status feedback to let


363
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:29,536
us know how the car is doing.


364
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:31,346
There is completion feedback to


365
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,526
let us know whether actions


366
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:34,716
we've performed are completed


367
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,456
successfully or failed.


368
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,586
Warning feedback, to tell us


369
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:39,906
about potential problems.


370
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:41,776
And there is feedback to let us


371
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,136
know when something we've tried


372
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:45,036
to do has caused an error.


373
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:48,506
Now, for our safety, for the


374
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,836
safety of other drivers and


375
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,876
pedestrians, the feedback that


376
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,566
cars provide must be clear,


377
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:55,986
immediate, and understandable.


378
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,696
So let's check out how cars


379
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,006
communicate with us, starting


380
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,196
with how they tell us about


381
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:02,976
their status.


382
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,136
Now, we have all loaded into the


383
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,036
car, and we are ready to go.


384
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,806
So looking at the gear shifter,


385
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,676
I can see that the car is in


386
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:12,076
park.


387
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:14,676
Knowing what gear the car is in


388
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,846
is super important information.


389
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:18,786
It is so important that it's


390
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,726
displayed twice, on the


391
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,756
gearshift, and in the instrument


392
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:23,206
cluster.


393
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:25,476
It would be really bad if I


394
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,156
thought the car was in park when


395
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,596
it was actually in drive, or if


396
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:30,906
I thought the car was in drive,


397
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,756
when it was actually in reverse.


398
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:35,326
Other status feedback lets me


399
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,856
see the fuel level, so I can


400
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:38,986
anticipate and predict how far


401
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,516
we can go before we need to


402
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:41,076
refuel.


403
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,686
And seeing our current speed


404
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,876
helps me to avoid getting costly


405
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:46,786
speeding tickets.


406
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,076
These are two really critical


407
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:50,226
pieces of information.


408
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,596
I don't want to run out of gas


409
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,296
before we get to the hotel, and


410
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:54,586
the lovely folks in finance have


411
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,606
told me repeatedly that I cannot


412
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,186
expend speeding tickets.


413
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,836
Now, status information in apps


414
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:02,276
should be just as clear.


415
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,426
So, for example, in the mail


416
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,386
app, unread status indicators


417
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,216
help people to prioritize which


418
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,856
emails to read first.


419
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:13,426
In Calendar, status indicators


420
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,216
help people to see when someone


421
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,076
can't make a meeting and it


422
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:17,176
helps them determine if they


423
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,126
need to reschedule.


424
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:20,256
In the Camera app, there are


425
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,096
three elements to let people


426
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:23,366
know that a video is being


427
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:23,926
recorded.


428
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,036
The red dot, the incrementing


429
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,506
time code, the state of the


430
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:28,356
record button.


431
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,916
They all let people know that a


432
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,636
precious but fleeing moment is


433
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:34,486
being recorded.


434
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,676
Showing status clearly and


435
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,196
directly is crucial for saving


436
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:42,406
people time and helping them to


437
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:43,786
avoid making mistakes.


438
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:46,466
Next up is completion feedback.


439
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:49,006
We are ready to go, so I start


440
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:49,406
the car [engine starts].


441
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,836
We can hear the engine turn


442
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,136
over.


443
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,576
We can feel the vibration of the


444
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:57,256
motor running.


445
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,036
We see that instrument cluster


446
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:00,986
come to life.


447
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,316
There is no doubt that we are


448
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,066
ready to go.


449
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,556
And as I shift, from Park into


450
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:11,126
Drive, I get tactile feedback to


451
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:12,436
let me know that I'm moving


452
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:13,446
through those gears.


453
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:15,466
And as we pull out of the


454
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:17,326
parking spot, we hear [clicking]


455
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:19,246
the doors lock.


456
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:21,846
This happens automatically, so


457
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,586
it is even more important that


458
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,626
we get this feedback.


459
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,916
All of this feedback is


460
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,696
reassuring.


461
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:30,116
It's our car's way of saying it


462
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:32,206
is all good, I'm doing exactly


463
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:33,786
what it is that you wanted me to


464
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:35,816
do, and this frees me up to


465
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:37,946
focus on other cognitive tasks,


466
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,956
like making sure it's safe to


467
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,286
pull out of the parking spot.


468
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,966
Completion feedback in apps


469
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,776
serves the very same purpose.


470
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,136
The sound of a locked iPhone


471
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:48,696
[clicking].


472
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,846
The animation of an email being


473
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:54,606
marked as unread, or the


474
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,336
animation of an email being


475
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:56,756
deleted.


476
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:59,326
These cues are discreet, and


477
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,536
they're non-invasive, but


478
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,136
they're hard to ignore, and they


479
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:03,226
provide that necessary


480
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:05,206
reassurance that our devices are


481
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,756
performing as expected.


482
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:09,716
Of course, confirmation feedback


483
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,366
can be even more obvious.


484
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,096
The animation and sound of a


485
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:14,966
successful Apple Pay transaction


486
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:15,316
[tone sounds].


487
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,486
It's very hard to miss.


488
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,926
Every action taken in your app


489
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:22,636
should provide some form of


490
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:24,376
confirmation feedback, because


491
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,896
it is absolutely necessary for


492
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,316
letting people know that actions


493
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:28,686
they've performed were


494
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:29,326
successful.


495
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,036
Warnings help people to


496
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:33,416
understand in advance about


497
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,366
potential errors.


498
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:36,096
Low fuel level.


499
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:37,706
Low break pads.


500
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,106
Low oil level.


501
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:41,706
Warnings can be communicated


502
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,126
using status indicators,


503
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,816
messages, and the instrument


504
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,206
cluster, built-in display,


505
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,426
sounds, or all of the above.


506
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:50,956
These warnings are important.


507
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:52,766
They keep us safe, and they


508
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:55,106
protect our car from damage.


509
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,246
And lastly, error feedback in


510
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,996
cars, as with apps, is crucial.


511
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,136
If you try to start a car


512
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,086
without gas, you will get an


513
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:06,326
error message about that.


514
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:08,866
Now errors are always


515
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:10,846
disappointing and frustrating.


516
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:12,965
It's best to help people avoid


517
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,136
making errors in the first


518
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:14,556
place.


519
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:17,066
Warnings and confirmation


520
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:17,925
feedback can help.


521
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:20,316
For instance, in-line form


522
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:21,685
validation is a fantastic


523
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,195
technique for letting people


524
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:24,445
know what values will be


525
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:27,116
accepted, and what values will


526
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:27,346
not.


527
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:29,846
Getting this feedback in real


528
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,706
time helps people to course


529
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:32,986
correct so that they don't run


530
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,106
into errors later.


531
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:37,006
You can also try to infer what a


532
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,946
person was wishing to do, or


533
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:40,936
what they intended to do when


534
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,756
they made a mistake, and then do


535
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:44,066
something reasonable.


536
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:47,176
So, for example, in the new


537
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:49,666
version of Things 3, if you type


538
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,586
in the date June 31st, which by


539
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:53,656
the way is a date that does not


540
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,346
exist, but it's a common mistake


541
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,226
for people to make, the app


542
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:59,536
doesn't throw up an error or


543
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,576
show a warning.


544
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,236
No. Instead, it automatically


545
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,316
corrects the date to July 1st.


546
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:08,226
It's such a subtle thing.


547
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,516
It's kind of brilliant, and it's


548
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,566
a very human thing to do.


549
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,556
Now, as you can see, clear,


550
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:17,266
timely, and understandable and


551
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,836
informative feedback is


552
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:19,376
essential.


553
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,776
Feedback answers super important


554
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:22,426
questions.


555
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,086
What can I do?


556
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,286
What just happened?


557
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:28,876
What is currently happening?


558
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,176
And what will happen in the


559
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:31,646
future?


560
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:35,376
Many apps do not do a very good


561
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:36,706
job of providing feedback.


562
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,306
The reason for this, I think, is


563
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,536
that when you're designing, it


564
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:42,816
is so easy to start to think


565
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,636
about static screens, and you


566
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,076
can lose sight of the fact that


567
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:47,816
interactive experiences happen


568
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,506
over time, with lots of back and


569
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:50,926
forth.


570
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:53,866
Good feedback is like having a


571
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,406
conversation with the person who


572
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:55,966
designed it.


573
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,866
As a designer, feedback is your


574
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:01,126
way of letting -- answering


575
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:03,056
people's unspoken questions.


576
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:05,016
It is your way of letting people


577
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:06,656
know how they're doing, and


578
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:07,896
providing helpful guidance to


579
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,106
them.


580
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,706
So when designing your app,


581
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:12,546
imagine that you're having a


582
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,876
conversation with the person who


583
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:15,346
is using it.


584
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,916
What would you say if you were


585
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,266
in the room with them?


586
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:21,126
How would you say it?


587
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:23,996
I have a very simple, but highly


588
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,146
effective technique to share


589
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:25,496
with you.


590
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,456
Ask someone who has never used


591
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:28,596
your app before to use it.


592
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,736
Have them tell you what they are


593
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:31,996
thinking, what they think is


594
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,696
unclear, what they find to be


595
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:34,356
confusing.


596
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:37,896
Then simply explain to them how


597
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,586
your app actually works.


598
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,756
Guide them along, explain to


599
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:43,546
them what's happening, and what


600
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:44,826
they should be paying attention


601
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:45,086
to.


602
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,186
Then step back.


603
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,156
Consider how what you've said


604
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,766
might differ from what the app


605
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:52,756
is communicating.


606
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,886
In my experience, when someone


607
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:56,576
needs to explain their design to


608
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,886
me, it is usually so much more


609
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:02,976
clear than the design itself.


610
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,226
What people tell me fills in the


611
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:06,006
gaps that are left by their


612
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:06,526
design.


613
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,096
We tend to be much better


614
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,856
communicators when we're sitting


615
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,906
with someone in person to try to


616
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,536
capture that experience.


617
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:16,826
Okay, so that is feedback.


618
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,916
Now, the next design principle


619
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,676
is closely related to feedback,


620
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,516
and that is the principle of


621
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:23,296
visibility.


622
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:26,156
Good feedback does not matter


623
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,836
very much if people can't see


624
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:27,986
it.


625
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,666
Visibility captures something


626
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,756
very obvious.


627
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:34,126
The usability of a design is


628
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,516
greatly improved when controls


629
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,446
and information are clearly


630
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:38,966
visible.


631
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:41,596
See? It's kind of obvious.


632
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:43,766
Consider how important


633
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,776
visibility is in your car.


634
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,036
The instrument cluster presents


635
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:49,486
status information and warning


636
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:51,366
indicators directly in front of


637
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:51,596
you.


638
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,766
Instrument clusters are visually


639
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:54,196
cluttered.


640
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:55,196
There's all sorts of text, and


641
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,716
numbers and moving gauges and


642
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:57,786
blinking lights and status


643
00:20:57,786 --> 00:20:58,436
indicators.


644
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:00,966
They're not called clusters


645
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,756
without reason.


646
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:05,256
But all of this is necessary for


647
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:07,416
operating a vehicle, and needs


648
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,316
to be plainly visible, without


649
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,906
you having to move your head or


650
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:12,346
your body.


651
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,106
Hiding some of this information


652
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,076
or putting it elsewhere in the


653
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,276
car would hurt usability.


654
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,526
Critical feedback would just get


655
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,676
ignored, and the same is true


656
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:24,386
for apps.


657
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:27,576
In the Mail app, badges provide


658
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:29,426
helpful status information about


659
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:30,456
email messages.


660
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,156
Removing that information might


661
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,026
reduce clutter.


662
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,746
It could look a little bit


663
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,196
cleaner, but it would greatly


664
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,196
reduce usability.


665
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,136
People would have to navigate


666
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:42,666
into each email message to get


667
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,486
that information.


668
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,506
It would be very inefficient,


669
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:47,126
and it would be very tedious.


670
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:49,326
So it is important to surface


671
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,376
key status information at higher


672
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,216
levels whenever possible.


673
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,176
Or, consider the navigation in


674
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:56,726
the Clock app.


675
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:59,566
What if that was hidden into a


676
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:00,366
hamburger menu.


677
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:02,726
People would have a much harder


678
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:04,996
time seeing what other functions


679
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:06,796
the Clock app offers to them


680
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,486
beyond what is currently


681
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:08,966
visible.


682
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,716
Obviously there is a tradeoff


683
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:11,976
here.


684
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:14,376
Densely packed interfaces can be


685
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,926
overwhelming and they can slow


686
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:18,016
decision-making, especially for


687
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:19,286
people who are new to your app.


688
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:22,216
So visibility has to be weighed


689
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,636
against other considerations.


690
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:27,166
Now, with so many of us in the


691
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,996
car, I'm starting to feel a


692
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:31,086
little bit cramped, and I cannot


693
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,686
wait to get to the hotel, but


694
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,736
there is one more insanely


695
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,736
important design principle to


696
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,746
point out while we're here, and


697
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:40,496
that is about consistency.


698
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:43,826
The principle of consistency is


699
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:45,586
about representing similar


700
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:48,746
design features in similar ways.


701
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,516
If you've driven a car before,


702
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,426
there are symbols and terms that


703
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,626
you are no doubt familiar with.


704
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:56,476
You will recognize the symbols


705
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,396
for door lock, for window, for


706
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:01,296
gas, headlights, battery, oil,


707
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:02,386
and so forth.


708
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:04,596
You will be familiar with the


709
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,906
definitions of words like Park,


710
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,776
Drive, and Reverse, as they


711
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:10,356
apply to the operation of a


712
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:10,866
vehicle.


713
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,976
Consistency also applies to the


714
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,886
location and the configuration


715
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:16,716
of controls.


716
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:19,086
We all expect the brake to be on


717
00:23:19,086 --> 00:23:21,306
the left, and the accelerator to


718
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:22,206
be on the right.


719
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,396
Consistency greatly improves the


720
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,716
usability of a vehicle, or maybe


721
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,856
it is more clear to just flip


722
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:30,846
this around and say that


723
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,956
inconsistency undermines


724
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:34,016
usability.


725
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:38,236
Whoops. All cars share a common


726
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:40,266
design vocabulary for these


727
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,426
symbols and terms.


728
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:43,996
All cars position controls in a


729
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,436
relatively consistent way, and


730
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,546
because of this consistency, we


731
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:48,846
don't have to re-learn how to


732
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,686
drive a car every time we get


733
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:52,116
behind the wheel of a new one.


734
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,786
Now, maybe this is obvious, but


735
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:57,086
consistency is actually hard to


736
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:57,486
achieve.


737
00:23:58,216 --> 00:23:59,866
You have to make a conscious


738
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:02,956
effort to be consistent, and you


739
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:04,856
have to be consistent with the


740
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:05,546
right things.


741
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,316
You have to fully consider what


742
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,786
expectations people have when


743
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:10,636
they come to your app.


744
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,046
Those expectations are mostly


745
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,176
informed by their experiences


746
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:16,556
with the other apps that they


747
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,176
use.


748
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:19,536
The other apps that they use,


749
00:24:19,536 --> 00:24:20,706
how do you figure that out?


750
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,176
Of course, it is impossible for


751
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:22,756
you to know.


752
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:25,696
But you can make some informed


753
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:26,276
guesses.


754
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:28,426
Perhaps they've used other apps


755
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,676
that are similar to the things


756
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,686
that your app does.


757
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:31,836
Maybe not.


758
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:34,796
But it's very likely that they


759
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:36,096
have used other apps on the


760
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,766
platform.


761
00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:38,706
So you should pay attention to


762
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:40,156
platform conventions.


763
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,846
Things like iconography and


764
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,106
terminology, navigation schemes,


765
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:47,686
and even common work flows for


766
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,646
typical tasks.


767
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:51,926
Now, let me give you just one


768
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,596
example to make this, I think, a


769
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:54,876
lot more concrete.


770
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:57,996
On iOS, the glyph that we use to


771
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,676
represent the concept of an


772
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,796
action is an arrow that points


773
00:25:01,796 --> 00:25:03,296
up and away from a box.


774
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:05,916
Because the most common action


775
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,016
associated with this glyph is


776
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:10,006
share, we affectionately call


777
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:11,456
this a "sharrow."


778
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,966
I love that name.


779
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:16,626
Now, some apps use a different


780
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,566
icon to represent a similar


781
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:19,146
concept.


782
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,846
This icon is commonplace.


783
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:23,736
It is used on websites and other


784
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:24,426
platforms.


785
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:26,476
Now, this is a great glyph.


786
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:28,016
Do not get me wrong.


787
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:29,486
There is nothing wrong with this


788
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,376
glyph at all.


789
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,916
But it's not the symbol that iOS


790
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,556
users are most familiar with.


791
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:37,536
This glyph shows up in iOS apps


792
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,596
because of the desire to be


793
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:41,836
consistent, to consistently


794
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:43,436
represent this concept in a


795
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:46,536
consistent way across platforms


796
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:47,706
or with your website.


797
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:51,086
This is a perfectly rational and


798
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:53,276
reasonable thing to do, but it


799
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:54,566
is not the right call.


800
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:56,566
From the perspective of the


801
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:57,826
person who you are designing


802
00:25:57,876 --> 00:25:59,956
for, it is best to be consistent


803
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:01,186
with the symbol that they are


804
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,236
most familiar with.


805
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,406
Being consistent will go a long


806
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:07,476
way towards making your app more


807
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,206
approachable and usable.


808
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:13,066
Now, look, there is always the


809
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,666
impulse to, you know, do things


810
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,546
a little bit different.


811
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,486
And to be clear, this is a


812
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,606
really good thing.


813
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:24,116
You should absolutely be trying


814
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,566
out new ideas.


815
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,216
That's how innovation happens.


816
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:30,136
But inconsistencies about simple


817
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:32,276
things, like icons and labels,


818
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:33,696
can really trip people up.


819
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,126
So it's always best to be


820
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:37,556
consistent unless you have a


821
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:40,046
very strong justification to do


822
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:40,676
otherwise.


823
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:43,026
Now, I'm sure you're all


824
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:44,176
consistently ready to get out of


825
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:45,406
this car and get to the hotel,


826
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:46,736
but there is one last point


827
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:47,936
about consistency that I'd like


828
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,416
to make, and it is about


829
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,486
internal consistency.


830
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,436
Internal consistency is about


831
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:55,386
designing controls to share a


832
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,356
similar look and feel, that


833
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:58,166
match each other.


834
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:00,886
Your app's glyphs should have a


835
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,566
consistent visual style.


836
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,776
Text in your app should have a


837
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:06,606
limited number of font faces and


838
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:09,156
sizes and colors and so forth.


839
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,476
Internal consistency helps to


840
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,286
make an app feel cohesive or


841
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:15,746
whole.


842
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,416
When everything matches, when


843
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,296
everything fits, people are


844
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:21,726
given a deeper sense of a


845
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:23,096
product's integrity.


846
00:27:23,806 --> 00:27:25,886
We intuitively believe that


847
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:28,056
design choices were deliberate


848
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:29,856
and thoroughly considered.


849
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:32,336
And with very good reason.


850
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:34,166
Being consistent takes


851
00:27:34,476 --> 00:27:36,306
self-control and restraint.


852
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,046
All right, now because our car


853
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:40,606
was so darn consistent, we


854
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:42,396
finally managed to arrive safely


855
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:43,206
at the hotel.


856
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,076
That car ride was really stuffy.


857
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,546
So you decide to head up to your


858
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,366
room and freshen up a little


859
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:49,736
bit.


860
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:51,456
Perhaps you go throw on that


861
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,426
fresh new Aloha shirt you picked


862
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:54,196
up at the airport.


863
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,296
So, when you get to your room,


864
00:27:56,796 --> 00:27:58,776
you head to the bathroom, and


865
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,266
you turn the handles on the


866
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,256
faucet and let the water run a


867
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:03,726
little bit.


868
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:05,126
And after a couple of seconds


869
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:06,546
you put your finger under the


870
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:07,786
water to check the temperature.


871
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,346
It's still a little bit cool, so


872
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:11,516
you increase the hot water a


873
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:12,036
little bit.


874
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,676
You wait another couple of


875
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,146
seconds, and the water warms up,


876
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,136
and you commence face washing.


877
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:20,536
You feel refreshed and


878
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:21,396
reinvigorated.


879
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,926
Compared to driving a car, a


880
00:28:25,016 --> 00:28:26,906
faucet is really basic.


881
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,366
But at some point, you had to


882
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,846
learn how to use a faucet.


883
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:32,886
You learned by adjusting the


884
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:34,376
controls of various faucets and


885
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:35,886
observing the results.


886
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,226
For example, how do you know


887
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:39,496
which handle controlled the hot


888
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:39,876
water?


889
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,776
You knew because for the most


890
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,576
part hot water is controlled by


891
00:28:44,576 --> 00:28:45,776
the handle on the left.


892
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:48,526
And why would you keep testing


893
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,726
water temperature for a few


894
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:50,186
seconds?


895
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,076
You did this, because you expect


896
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,286
there to be a delay between when


897
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:54,836
you adjust the temperature and


898
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:56,136
when the water actually gets


899
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:56,576
warmer.


900
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:59,576
Looking at the water, it is


901
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,046
really hard to tell if the water


902
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:03,546
is cold or hot, and we have all


903
00:29:03,546 --> 00:29:05,036
experienced burning our hand


904
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:05,916
under a faucet.


905
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:08,286
Now, you don't think about these


906
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,966
things every time you use a


907
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:10,516
faucet.


908
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,826
You just intuitively expect


909
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:12,996
them.


910
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:16,186
Within each of your brains,


911
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:18,346
there is this tiny, little


912
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:22,376
adorable model of a faucet, and


913
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:24,576
that model represents the faucet


914
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:27,046
as a system of parts and


915
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:28,916
functions and behaviors.


916
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:32,366
There is a spout for producing


917
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:34,016
water, there's handles for


918
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:35,146
controlling temperature and


919
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:35,486
flow.


920
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:37,986
Those parts are arranged in


921
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,446
specific configuration, and your


922
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,116
model has certain behaviors,


923
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,806
like the latency between when


924
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:46,326
you adjust the hot water, and


925
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,116
when the temperature of the


926
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:48,856
water actually increases.


927
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:52,206
This model is referred to as


928
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,736
your mental model.


929
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,516
You have a mental model of every


930
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:57,666
system that you've ever


931
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:58,396
interacted with.


932
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:00,676
Those mental models are


933
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,026
over-simplifications.


934
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:03,846
They don't fully capture the


935
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,426
inner workings of these systems.


936
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:07,116
Though, the more experience you


937
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,956
have with a system, the more


938
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:12,586
sophisticated your model


939
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:12,976
becomes.


940
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:13,886
Mental models are developed


941
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,276
through personal experience, and


942
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,686
they're based on an incomplete


943
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:18,876
set of facts, so everyone's


944
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:20,426
mental model is unique.


945
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,546
Now, real quick, there is


946
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:24,366
actually two parts of a mental


947
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,496
model that are worth


948
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:26,716
understanding separately.


949
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,146
A system model is the model


950
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:31,616
about how a system works.


951
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:33,816
Our system model might involve


952
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:35,296
thinking about two independent


953
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,146
sources of water, one hot, and


954
00:30:37,146 --> 00:30:37,806
one cold.


955
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,196
And the system allows those


956
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:41,956
inputs to be mixed, to create a


957
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,096
range of temperatures.


958
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:45,226
The system is not immediately


959
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:45,996
responsive.


960
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:47,176
Changes to temperature could


961
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:48,226
take a little bit of time,


962
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:50,696
especially when we first turn on


963
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:51,526
the faucet, right?


964
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,326
Our system model includes this


965
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:55,466
understanding of variable


966
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:56,726
latency and temperature.


967
00:30:57,986 --> 00:31:00,086
Okay. The other term is


968
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:01,166
interaction model.


969
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:03,456
Now, does anyone care to guess


970
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,026
what that model is?


971
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,796
Just go ahead and shout it out.


972
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:08,456
No, I'm just kidding.


973
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:10,406
Okay, you guys didn't fall for


974
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:10,496
that.


975
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:11,176
You're a smart crowd.


976
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,626
If you guessed that it's a model


977
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:15,086
about how we interact with the


978
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:17,026
system, then you are correct.


979
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:20,146
Our interaction model is that we


980
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:21,776
adjust the temperature and water


981
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,406
flow with the handles that are


982
00:31:23,406 --> 00:31:23,936
provided.


983
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,706
Okay, so now that we know a


984
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:28,416
couple of fancy terms, you might


985
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,036
be wondering how all of this is


986
00:31:30,036 --> 00:31:30,776
relevant to you?


987
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:34,316
Well, when a system such as a


988
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:36,526
faucet matches our mental model,


989
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:38,036
then our expectations of that


990
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:38,716
system are met.


991
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:40,786
When this happens, and we're not


992
00:31:40,786 --> 00:31:42,346
really conscious of our own


993
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:44,676
expectations, we perceive the


994
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,306
system to be intuitive.


995
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,766
Conversely, when a system


996
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:51,276
doesn't match our mental model,


997
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,376
it breaks our expectations, and


998
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:54,726
we perceive it to be


999
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:55,696
unintuitive.


1000
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:58,626
Now, let's just sit with this


1001
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,726
concept for a second.


1002
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:01,856
Because it's a really, really


1003
00:32:01,856 --> 00:32:03,466
important one in design.


1004
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:06,636
And to do that, I would like to


1005
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:08,296
share with you a little story


1006
00:32:08,986 --> 00:32:11,416
about a faucet designer named


1007
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:12,056
Mortimer.


1008
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:15,906
Now, like all of you, Mortimer


1009
00:32:15,906 --> 00:32:17,806
has a mental model of faucets.


1010
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:20,096
Though obviously Morty's mental


1011
00:32:20,096 --> 00:32:22,246
model is way more sophisticated,


1012
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:24,536
and way more bad ass than yours.


1013
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:26,806
I'm just being real with you, he


1014
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:27,876
is a faucet designer for a


1015
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:28,246
living.


1016
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,916
Now, consider that job that he


1017
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,316
has.


1018
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:33,856
His job is all about making


1019
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:35,766
amazing, best in class,


1020
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:38,536
delightful faucet experiences.


1021
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:41,146
And one day, like a bolt of


1022
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,156
lightning, he's struck with this


1023
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:45,086
amazing idea.


1024
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:47,346
We have been doing this faucet


1025
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:48,576
thing all wrong.


1026
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:51,396
He has a new concept about how


1027
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:52,616
to make things better.


1028
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:55,646
Instead of using one handle for


1029
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,466
hot water flow, and another


1030
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:59,766
handle for cold water flow, we


1031
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:01,286
should just have one lever to


1032
00:33:01,286 --> 00:33:02,936
control temperature, and the


1033
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:04,526
other should control flow.


1034
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:06,066
This way people won't


1035
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,156
accidentally increase or


1036
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:08,166
decrease temperature when they


1037
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,586
are adjusting flow and vice


1038
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:09,956
versa.


1039
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,096
It is brilliant.


1040
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,926
This is why they pay Mortimer


1041
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:16,716
the big bucks.


1042
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,316
Now, at this point, Morty has


1043
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,836
this new and super awesome


1044
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,516
mental model about faucets in


1045
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:24,116
his mind.


1046
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,466
Unfortunately, there is just one


1047
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:30,066
tiny little problem.


1048
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,846
Morty's mental model doesn't


1049
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:33,236
match the mental model that


1050
00:33:33,236 --> 00:33:34,936
people have about faucets.


1051
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:37,086
When people use the Morty


1052
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:38,646
faucet, it doesn't match their


1053
00:33:38,646 --> 00:33:41,116
expectations at all and they say


1054
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,316
it is unintuitive.


1055
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,726
What is worse, the Morty faucet


1056
00:33:45,976 --> 00:33:47,596
looks nearly identical to a


1057
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:49,526
regular faucet, but it behaved


1058
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:50,606
totally different.


1059
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:52,836
When people turned on the hot


1060
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:54,766
water, no water came out.


1061
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:57,756
This mismatch between expected


1062
00:33:57,756 --> 00:34:00,076
behavior and experienced reality


1063
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,096
created a major usability


1064
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:02,606
problem.


1065
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:05,146
Perhaps alterations to the


1066
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,556
faucet's form could suggest that


1067
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:07,876
it had a different interaction


1068
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:08,235
model.


1069
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,766
Maybe adding labels would help,


1070
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:13,616
but these are just remedies to a


1071
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,416
deeper issue.


1072
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,716
Labels and subtle variations of


1073
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:18,466
form are design cues that can


1074
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:20,226
easily be overlooked, especially


1075
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,746
when people have deeply


1076
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:23,806
ingrained notions about how a


1077
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,416
system works, and how they


1078
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,176
interact with it.


1079
00:34:27,576 --> 00:34:29,966
This is a big issue in app


1080
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:30,366
design.


1081
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,386
Trust me, I have been there more


1082
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:33,835
than once.


1083
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,576
Trying to get people to change


1084
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,146
their mental model of how your


1085
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:39,606
app works is risky.


1086
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:42,226
This becomes even more true the


1087
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:43,735
more familiar people are with


1088
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:44,426
your app.


1089
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:46,775
Changes to any long-lived


1090
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:49,146
existing product will inevitably


1091
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,806
be hard for people to adjust to.


1092
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:52,376
It really doesn't matter how


1093
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:54,286
good or how necessary those


1094
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:55,036
changes may be.


1095
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:57,896
When considering big changes to


1096
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,886
an existing app, you have to be


1097
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:02,456
100 percent positive that those


1098
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:04,196
changes will lead to clear wins


1099
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:05,766
for the people who currently use


1100
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:06,376
your app.


1101
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:08,706
Making changes just for the sake


1102
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,096
of it is not a good


1103
00:35:10,096 --> 00:35:10,966
justification.


1104
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,376
Go carefully.


1105
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:13,606
Test your design.


1106
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,226
Prove to yourself beyond a


1107
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,286
shadow of a doubt that your


1108
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:19,086
innovations are objectively


1109
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:19,446
better.


1110
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,696
If you can do that, then it's


1111
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:23,546
good to push through.


1112
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:24,936
People will come around


1113
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:25,606
eventually.


1114
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:30,116
Okay. So it's time to start


1115
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:31,206
getting ready for dinner.


1116
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:33,016
So you decide to throw on that


1117
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:35,666
dope new Aloha shirt, and you


1118
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,146
exit the bathroom and you turn


1119
00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:38,726
off the lights by flipping a


1120
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:39,166
switch.


1121
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:41,226
The sun is setting outside.


1122
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:43,586
It is a bit dark, so you turn on


1123
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:44,556
a light in the hallway.


1124
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:46,696
Then you walk over to the


1125
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,596
bedroom and you flip on another


1126
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:50,826
couple of light switches to turn


1127
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,036
the lights on out there.


1128
00:35:52,946 --> 00:35:54,716
This, in a nutshell, is the


1129
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:56,986
design principle of proximity.


1130
00:35:58,146 --> 00:36:00,296
Proximity is about the distance


1131
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,506
between a control and the object


1132
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:03,546
that it affects.


1133
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:06,506
The closer a control is to that


1134
00:36:06,506 --> 00:36:08,946
object, the more we assume there


1135
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:11,156
to be a connection between the


1136
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:11,446
two.


1137
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:14,076
Of course the bathroom light


1138
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:15,066
switch is in the bathroom.


1139
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:16,636
Of course the hallway light


1140
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:17,486
switch is in the hallway.


1141
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,126
Of course the bedroom light


1142
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:21,696
switch is in the bedroom.


1143
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,506
Greater proximity also makes


1144
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:24,576
ergonomic sense.


1145
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:26,356
In general, the closer you are


1146
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:27,566
to an object or region of


1147
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:29,166
interest, the more likely you


1148
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,086
are to want to interact with it


1149
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:32,296
and control it.


1150
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:33,946
People think to turn on the


1151
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:35,136
bathroom light when they walk


1152
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:35,886
into the bathroom.


1153
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:37,056
So, by putting the light switch


1154
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:38,786
right by the door, it is within


1155
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:40,136
arm's reach when they need it


1156
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:40,606
most.


1157
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,116
Proximity is also useful for


1158
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:46,076
expressing relationships between


1159
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:46,606
controls.


1160
00:36:47,156 --> 00:36:48,436
So, for example, if you see a


1161
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:50,526
set of switches on the wall, and


1162
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:51,846
you know that one of them


1163
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:54,026
controls lights, then it's


1164
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,546
reasonable for you to assume


1165
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,366
that every switch is a light


1166
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:57,756
switch.


1167
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,166
If one of them controls the


1168
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,036
shade, then it would be better


1169
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:03,446
to separate it out from the


1170
00:37:03,446 --> 00:37:03,826
rest.


1171
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,656
This configuration makes it


1172
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,336
easier for people to remember


1173
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,016
which switch controls the shade,


1174
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:11,956
and which ones control the


1175
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:12,386
lights.


1176
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:15,516
Okay, now it's probably worth


1177
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:17,546
pointing out right now that we


1178
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:19,206
have a very special name for


1179
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:21,066
this configuration, this


1180
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:22,276
arrangement here on the right.


1181
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,076
Does anyone care to guess what


1182
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:24,526
it is?


1183
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:26,116
Just go ahead and shout it out.


1184
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:28,226
Okay, you're smart, you're not


1185
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:28,846
going to fall for it.


1186
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:31,026
I just tried to get you.


1187
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,336
Okay, if you guessed in your


1188
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,036
mind that it is a group, then


1189
00:37:34,036 --> 00:37:35,256
you win a prize.


1190
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:36,546
It is a trip to Hawaii.


1191
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,476
Grouping is a very fundamental


1192
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:40,796
and significant design


1193
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:41,376
principle.


1194
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,076
Grouping helps people to


1195
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:44,676
understand the relationships


1196
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:46,656
between elements, and it is key


1197
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:48,306
for giving a design structure.


1198
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,656
Now, while we all understand


1199
00:37:50,656 --> 00:37:52,806
this, many apps don't


1200
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:54,196
effectively use grouping.


1201
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,846
It can be easy to overlook.


1202
00:37:57,246 --> 00:37:58,586
Now, let's take a look at a


1203
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,156
couple of examples of how


1204
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:02,026
proximity and grouping can be


1205
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,636
used to structure a design, and


1206
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:06,546
establish relationships between


1207
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:08,536
controls and the objects or


1208
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,666
views that they affect.


1209
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:13,266
And keynote, proximity helps us


1210
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:16,076
to associate the view menu with


1211
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:18,006
the slide navigator and the


1212
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:18,706
canvas area.


1213
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,576
The objects that it affects.


1214
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:23,086
The object creation tools are


1215
00:38:23,086 --> 00:38:23,856
positioned right above the


1216
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,476
canvas, which is where those


1217
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:26,646
objects go.


1218
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:29,486
The anime format and document


1219
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:31,456
visibility switches are located


1220
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:32,736
just above where those panels


1221
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:33,436
get displayed.


1222
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,516
In Sketch, you can see how


1223
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,306
grouping is used to cluster


1224
00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:39,606
related controls with each


1225
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:41,416
other, like the grouping


1226
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:42,016
controls.


1227
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:44,076
The Transform and Edit tools.


1228
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:46,356
The Pathfinding operations.


1229
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:48,646
And the Layer Ordering actions.


1230
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,196
Now, I just shared two Mac apps,


1231
00:38:52,576 --> 00:38:54,206
and the need for proximity and


1232
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,886
grouping is definitely higher


1233
00:38:56,156 --> 00:38:57,686
the larger your interface is,


1234
00:38:58,186 --> 00:39:00,086
but the principles are still


1235
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,896
crucial for smaller screens,


1236
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:04,646
like iPads and iPhones, and even


1237
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:05,376
the Apple Watch.


1238
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,546
Okay, so I think there is time


1239
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:10,426
to learn about just one more


1240
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:11,756
design principle before we head


1241
00:39:11,756 --> 00:39:12,986
downstairs to the hotel


1242
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:14,656
restaurant and grab some dinner.


1243
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:17,016
Let's go back to that Shade


1244
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:17,996
control again.


1245
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:20,716
Now, looking at this control, do


1246
00:39:20,756 --> 00:39:22,406
you suppose that the Shade is


1247
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:24,306
open or closed?


1248
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:25,976
How about now?


1249
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:28,236
Just show of hands here.


1250
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:29,716
How many people think that it is


1251
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:30,286
closed?


1252
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:34,236
Okay, okay, and how many of you


1253
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:35,356
think that it is open?


1254
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:38,516
Yeah, you guys are a really


1255
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:39,776
smart group of people.


1256
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,816
All right.


1257
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:43,826
Mapping is how you know that it


1258
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:44,336
is closed.


1259
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,376
Mapping is about designing


1260
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:48,556
controls to resemble the objects


1261
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:49,366
that they affect.


1262
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,516
Shades go up, and shades go


1263
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:52,886
down.


1264
00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:54,896
So it makes sense to use a


1265
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:56,996
control that mirrors that up and


1266
00:39:56,996 --> 00:39:57,896
down movement.


1267
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:01,126
There is no ambiguity about how


1268
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:02,976
to raise or lower the shade.


1269
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:05,896
Mapping also relates to how


1270
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:07,706
controls are arranged relative


1271
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:08,356
to each other.


1272
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,526
Their order should resemble the


1273
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,306
configuration of the objects


1274
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:12,966
that they affect.


1275
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:15,616
So let's say that these light


1276
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,496
switches control three sets of


1277
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:18,856
ceiling lights in the bedroom.


1278
00:40:20,226 --> 00:40:21,866
Good mapping involves arranging


1279
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,106
the switches to mirror the


1280
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,746
layout of those lights.


1281
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:28,076
By focusing on mapping, it is so


1282
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:29,896
much easier to make choices


1283
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:31,406
about where to position


1284
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,916
controls, how to order them, and


1285
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,816
even which controls to use.


1286
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:37,606
I mean, we've all seen light


1287
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,926
switches that look like this.


1288
00:40:40,316 --> 00:40:41,876
You will often find labels when


1289
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,396
mapping is unclear.


1290
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:44,806
It is a telltale sign.


1291
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:47,116
But it is not a particularly


1292
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:47,976
good solution.


1293
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:49,776
Reading takes time, and it


1294
00:40:49,776 --> 00:40:51,106
doesn't help people to memorize


1295
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:53,046
the location of controls or how


1296
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:54,636
they should interact with them.


1297
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:56,566
Now, in the context of


1298
00:40:56,566 --> 00:40:57,796
interface, adjusting a


1299
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,356
horizontal property is much more


1300
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,166
intuitive with the horizontal


1301
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:01,626
slider.


1302
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:03,956
Similarly, using a dial for


1303
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:05,696
adjusting rotation is much


1304
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,076
better than a slider or a


1305
00:41:07,076 --> 00:41:07,546
stepper.


1306
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:11,046
Of course, the best mapping is


1307
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:12,626
the most direct mapping.


1308
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:14,786
Providing the ability for people


1309
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,666
to directly manipulate an object


1310
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:17,926
is more straightforward, it's


1311
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,416
more intuitive, and precise.


1312
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:21,026
Whether that is with a pointer


1313
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:24,626
on macOS, or Gestures on iOS.


1314
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:28,086
Okay, so enough about light


1315
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:28,526
switches.


1316
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:30,686
I don't know about you, but I am


1317
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:32,446
starving, and it is time to head


1318
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,596
downstairs and get some dinner.


1319
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:36,756
Now, we all meet up in the lobby


1320
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:38,076
and we make our way over to the


1321
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:39,956
restaurant, and as you sit down


1322
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,486
at the table, you see in front


1323
00:41:41,486 --> 00:41:43,366
of you an empty dinner plate.


1324
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,886
What can you do with this dinner


1325
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:47,126
plate?


1326
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:50,626
Well, of course, you can put


1327
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:53,076
food on it, #putfoodonit


1328
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:54,296
[laughter].


1329
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:56,466
But you can do all sorts of


1330
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:57,546
other stuff too.


1331
00:41:58,476 --> 00:41:59,916
The plate is smooth, so it looks


1332
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,006
like it is easy to rotate and


1333
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:01,676
slide around.


1334
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:04,066
There is a nice little gap along


1335
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,436
the edge, so it looks easy to


1336
00:42:05,436 --> 00:42:06,796
grab and lift up.


1337
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:09,256
It looks like a Frisbee, so you


1338
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,546
consider how far you can make it


1339
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:12,596
go.


1340
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:14,006
Or maybe not.


1341
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:16,416
Our notions about how we


1342
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,836
interact with this plate are


1343
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,246
called affordances.


1344
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:23,186
In other words, a plate's


1345
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:24,966
physical characteristics provide


1346
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:27,876
visual and tactile cues about


1347
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:29,356
what interactions the plate


1348
00:42:29,356 --> 00:42:30,626
afford to us.


1349
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:32,576
A plate's physical


1350
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:34,216
characteristics make certain


1351
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:36,016
actions seem possible, and


1352
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:37,286
others less possible.


1353
00:42:37,976 --> 00:42:38,896
We look at the plate, and we


1354
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:39,916
think, I am going to put food


1355
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:40,886
onto this object.


1356
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:42,896
Or, we might also think, I'm


1357
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,256
going to use this object to


1358
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:45,836
transport my food to a different


1359
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:46,356
location.


1360
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:48,226
We don't look at this plate and


1361
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:49,536
think, I'm going to use it for


1362
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:50,386
drinking water.


1363
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,366
Affordance is not an attribute


1364
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:54,646
of the object itself.


1365
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:56,856
It is more about the


1366
00:42:56,856 --> 00:42:58,726
relationship that individuals


1367
00:42:58,866 --> 00:42:59,946
have to an object.


1368
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:03,806
Affordance varies based on one's


1369
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:05,186
physical abilities.


1370
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,246
So, therefore, affordance varies


1371
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:08,436
from person to person.


1372
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:10,636
So, for example, this is kind of


1373
00:43:10,636 --> 00:43:11,356
an extreme one.


1374
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:13,846
A Frisbee affords me with a


1375
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:15,486
possibility of catching and


1376
00:43:15,486 --> 00:43:15,976
throwing.


1377
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,356
For my dog, a Frisbee affords


1378
00:43:18,356 --> 00:43:20,276
the ability of catching, but not


1379
00:43:20,276 --> 00:43:20,706
throwing.


1380
00:43:21,286 --> 00:43:23,556
A plate affords me with the


1381
00:43:23,556 --> 00:43:25,466
ability of eating food off of


1382
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:26,253
it.


1383
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:28,226
Interestingly, my dog perceives


1384
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:29,386
the very same affordance.


1385
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:32,446
Now, because affordance is


1386
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:34,476
subjective, one person can


1387
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:35,566
perceive an affordance when


1388
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:36,386
another does not.


1389
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:38,126
People are more likely to


1390
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:39,206
perceive an affordance when it


1391
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:40,776
is related to an action that


1392
00:43:40,776 --> 00:43:42,126
they are more likely to take.


1393
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:45,516
So, for instance, I could use a


1394
00:43:45,516 --> 00:43:47,256
plate as a saucer, and it would


1395
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:48,696
make a really great saucer.


1396
00:43:48,766 --> 00:43:50,236
I don't think I would get any


1397
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:53,386
argument from you guys, but this


1398
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:55,116
is an unlikely action to take,


1399
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:56,876
so I wouldn't readily perceive a


1400
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,326
plate's glass-putting


1401
00:43:58,326 --> 00:44:00,566
affordance, whereas I'm very


1402
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:01,766
likely to put food on it.


1403
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:03,786
So I readily perceive the


1404
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:05,336
plate's food-putting affordance.


1405
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:08,736
You perceive affordances with


1406
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:10,266
every environment and every


1407
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:11,596
object that you have ever


1408
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:12,426
interacted with.


1409
00:44:13,076 --> 00:44:14,166
When you walked into the


1410
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,276
restaurant, you passed through a


1411
00:44:16,276 --> 00:44:17,566
door that afforded you the


1412
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:18,916
ability of passage.


1413
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:21,096
The door is human-sized, so you


1414
00:44:21,096 --> 00:44:22,766
can imagine your body moving


1415
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:24,036
through it unobstructed.


1416
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:26,226
There was a continuous grounds


1417
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:27,746
plane, so you can imagine


1418
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:29,056
yourself walking along it,


1419
00:44:29,056 --> 00:44:30,526
without stumbling, tripping.


1420
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:32,966
The chair that you sat in


1421
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:34,886
affords the ability for sitting.


1422
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,136
The table in front of you


1423
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:38,616
affords the ability of putting


1424
00:44:38,616 --> 00:44:39,696
objects onto it.


1425
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,286
The ground below your feet


1426
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:44,176
affords the ability for resting


1427
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:44,556
your feet.


1428
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:47,896
Manufactured objects include


1429
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:49,976
cues to evoke affordances.


1430
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:52,256
They let people know what


1431
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,866
actions are possible, and the


1432
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,996
obviousness and visibility of


1433
00:44:56,996 --> 00:44:58,526
those cues helps people to know


1434
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:00,846
the correct or the intended ways


1435
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,846
of interacting, and the same


1436
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:04,096
should be true for apps.


1437
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,106
Sliders afford dragging a knob


1438
00:45:07,176 --> 00:45:08,436
along a track.


1439
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:10,676
Dials afford rotating.


1440
00:45:11,396 --> 00:45:13,546
Buttons afford tapping, and


1441
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:13,916
clicking.


1442
00:45:14,956 --> 00:45:16,406
In each of these examples,


1443
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:18,326
affordance is communicated with


1444
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:19,766
maximum efficiency.


1445
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:22,236
In fact, over time, we are all


1446
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:23,726
becoming more comfortable with


1447
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:25,096
increasing levels of


1448
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:25,926
abstraction.


1449
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:28,186
The button, after all, is just a


1450
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:30,386
highly abstracted version of a


1451
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:32,586
physical, real-world button.


1452
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,456
All that's necessary to create a


1453
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:36,756
strong connection between the


1454
00:45:36,756 --> 00:45:38,176
two are the rounding of the


1455
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:38,816
corners.


1456
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,006
A subtle drop shadow around the


1457
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,596
slider knob separates it from


1458
00:45:42,596 --> 00:45:43,726
the track that it is positioned


1459
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:45,336
over, and this separation


1460
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:46,676
suggests that it can be moved


1461
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:47,506
independently.


1462
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,576
And even that visual cue might


1463
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:51,316
not be completely necessary.


1464
00:45:51,746 --> 00:45:53,176
For most people, simply seeing a


1465
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:54,686
filled-in circle over a line is


1466
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:56,566
all that is needed to express a


1467
00:45:56,566 --> 00:45:57,676
sliding affordance.


1468
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,236
And sometimes affordance is


1469
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:01,886
communicated using animation.


1470
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:03,956
Tapping on the Weather app, we


1471
00:46:04,026 --> 00:46:05,966
see it slide up a little bit.


1472
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:07,456
This suggests the possibility


1473
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:09,186
that the content areas can be


1474
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:09,736
scrolled.


1475
00:46:10,586 --> 00:46:14,506
And sure enough, they can.


1476
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,066
Regardless of the exact


1477
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:17,496
technique that you use, your


1478
00:46:17,616 --> 00:46:19,426
app's interface must make clear


1479
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:21,136
what action possibilities it


1480
00:46:21,136 --> 00:46:21,636
affords.


1481
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,196
If not, people won't know how to


1482
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:25,516
properly interact with it.


1483
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:27,006
They'll interact in ways that


1484
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:28,356
your app doesn't support, and


1485
00:46:28,356 --> 00:46:30,046
they'll confuse controls for


1486
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:31,616
non-interactive objects.


1487
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:35,106
Okay. So, now that we know where


1488
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:37,086
our food is supposed to go, it


1489
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:37,956
is time to order.


1490
00:46:38,846 --> 00:46:39,866
Now, I am thinking about getting


1491
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:42,466
a cheeseburger because they're


1492
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,266
delicious, obviously, and when a


1493
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:45,966
waiter comes by to take my


1494
00:46:45,966 --> 00:46:47,856
order, I say, "Cheeseburger,


1495
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:48,196
please."


1496
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:51,066
He then asks how I would like it


1497
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:52,566
cooked, and "medium," I say.


1498
00:46:53,356 --> 00:46:54,236
He then asks what kind of


1499
00:46:54,236 --> 00:46:55,646
cheese, cheddar, Swiss, Jack,


1500
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,586
Gruyere, cottage?


1501
00:46:57,246 --> 00:46:58,456
"Cheddar," I say.


1502
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,656
He then asks whether I would


1503
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:03,116
like bacon, egg, avocado on it?


1504
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:04,826
"None," I say.


1505
00:47:05,016 --> 00:47:06,686
I am trying to keep my figure.


1506
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:09,406
He then asks whether I'd like


1507
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:11,346
salad, fries or onion rings.


1508
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:13,236
"Onion rings," I say.


1509
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:15,506
He then asks if I realize that


1510
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:16,746
cheeseburgers and onion rings


1511
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,896
are very high in calories, to


1512
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:20,656
which I reply, "Fake news"


1513
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:21,816
[laughter].


1514
00:47:21,816 --> 00:47:32,646
This [applause] in a nutshell is


1515
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:34,206
the principle of progressive


1516
00:47:34,206 --> 00:47:34,836
disclosure.


1517
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:37,036
Progressive disclosure is a


1518
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:38,526
technique for managing


1519
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:39,226
complexity.


1520
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:41,546
The term is used almost


1521
00:47:41,546 --> 00:47:43,286
exclusively in the context of


1522
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:45,066
interaction design, and to my


1523
00:47:45,066 --> 00:47:46,196
knowledge, this is the first


1524
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,236
time that anyone was dumb enough


1525
00:47:48,236 --> 00:47:49,346
to try to use it to describe


1526
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:50,336
ordering a cheeseburger.


1527
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:52,926
The basic idea is this.


1528
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:55,716
Progressive disclosure gradually


1529
00:47:55,716 --> 00:47:57,666
eases people from the simple to


1530
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,756
the more complex.


1531
00:47:59,856 --> 00:48:01,546
And progressive disclosure is


1532
00:48:01,636 --> 00:48:03,276
also about hiding away


1533
00:48:03,276 --> 00:48:05,116
complexity, so that people can


1534
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,026
accomplish basic tasks with


1535
00:48:07,026 --> 00:48:09,176
simple and more approachable


1536
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:09,966
interfaces.


1537
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:12,406
Ordering a cheeseburger would be


1538
00:48:12,496 --> 00:48:14,656
way more complex and daunting if


1539
00:48:14,656 --> 00:48:15,886
you had to consider all of those


1540
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:16,816
options at once.


1541
00:48:17,296 --> 00:48:18,856
Customizing your cheeseburger is


1542
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:20,396
way easier when someone steps


1543
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,196
you through the process one


1544
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:23,306
decision at a time.


1545
00:48:24,156 --> 00:48:25,506
And some choices that you make


1546
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:27,296
early on could make other


1547
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:28,816
choices irrelevant later.


1548
00:48:29,496 --> 00:48:31,776
So, for example, if I'd asked


1549
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:33,576
for French fries, the waiter


1550
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:35,116
would have then asked whether I


1551
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:37,276
wanted regular, truffle or


1552
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:39,136
garlic fries, and because I


1553
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:40,906
didn't ask for fries, I don't


1554
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:42,596
really care what kind of French


1555
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:44,736
fries they have, and telling me


1556
00:48:44,736 --> 00:48:46,466
about those options would just


1557
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,176
be a waste of my time and my


1558
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,646
limited mental abilities.


1559
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:52,976
Or would it be?


1560
00:48:53,856 --> 00:48:55,786
I mean, I like garlic fries a


1561
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:58,116
lot, and had I known that garlic


1562
00:48:58,116 --> 00:48:59,936
fries were on offer, I would


1563
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:00,666
have gotten them.


1564
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:04,086
So herein lies the rub.


1565
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:06,926
Progressive disclosure is a


1566
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:08,726
necessary and helpful technique


1567
00:49:09,036 --> 00:49:11,346
for managing complexity and


1568
00:49:11,346 --> 00:49:12,906
simplifying decision making.


1569
00:49:13,586 --> 00:49:15,966
But the same technique can bury


1570
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:17,596
information or functionality.


1571
00:49:18,326 --> 00:49:19,436
So what do you do?


1572
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:22,126
Well, discussions about how to


1573
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,276
properly use progressive


1574
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:24,866
disclosure often come down to


1575
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:25,776
the 80/20 rule.


1576
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:27,556
If you're not familiar, the


1577
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:29,696
80/20 rule is a design principle


1578
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:33,076
that says in essence 80 percent


1579
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:35,236
of a system's effects come from


1580
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:37,396
20 percent of its causes.


1581
00:49:38,506 --> 00:49:40,166
For an app, this might mean that


1582
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,606
80 percent of its benefit comes


1583
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:44,586
from 20 percent of the actions


1584
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:47,166
that it presents, or 80 percent


1585
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:48,876
of the people who use an app are


1586
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:51,346
only going to use 20 percent of


1587
00:49:51,346 --> 00:49:52,126
its functions.


1588
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:55,026
Now, the exact percentages are,


1589
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:56,026
of course, different.


1590
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,086
But the basic point is valid.


1591
00:49:58,596 --> 00:49:59,956
Not all information or


1592
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,016
functionality are created equal.


1593
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:04,566
Some is much more important than


1594
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:05,066
others.


1595
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,756
So, in order to reduce clutter,


1596
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:10,656
and simplify decision-making, it


1597
00:50:10,656 --> 00:50:12,256
is a really good thing to use


1598
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:14,336
progressive disclosure to hide


1599
00:50:14,336 --> 00:50:15,826
things of lesser importance.


1600
00:50:16,946 --> 00:50:18,546
In other words, if your app is


1601
00:50:18,546 --> 00:50:21,036
complex, it is okay to make the


1602
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:22,756
most useful 20 percent of


1603
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:25,186
functions easier to find by


1604
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:27,056
hiding the other 80 percent.


1605
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:29,946
A classic example of this is the


1606
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:30,736
print dialogue.


1607
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:33,106
Most of the time, people only


1608
00:50:33,106 --> 00:50:35,146
care about the basics, which


1609
00:50:35,146 --> 00:50:36,586
printer they're printing to, how


1610
00:50:36,586 --> 00:50:38,186
many copies, what the range of


1611
00:50:38,216 --> 00:50:39,016
pages are.


1612
00:50:39,806 --> 00:50:41,916
These are way less than 20


1613
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:42,916
percent of the functions


1614
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,836
available, and it is what people


1615
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:47,096
want way more than 80 percent of


1616
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:47,546
the time.


1617
00:50:48,516 --> 00:50:50,306
When more control is needed, a


1618
00:50:50,306 --> 00:50:51,936
bunch of options are just one


1619
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:52,486
click away.


1620
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:55,036
Not only does progressive


1621
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:56,686
disclosure reduce visual


1622
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,866
clutter, and make printing less


1623
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:01,296
difficult, it also lowers the


1624
00:51:01,296 --> 00:51:02,556
likelihood of people getting


1625
00:51:02,556 --> 00:51:04,746
confused and changing a setting


1626
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:05,476
that they don't really


1627
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:06,196
understand.


1628
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:08,706
Most of us have experienced


1629
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:10,426
receiving this call from a


1630
00:51:10,426 --> 00:51:12,076
parent, or a family member, or a


1631
00:51:12,076 --> 00:51:14,316
friend, who is kind of freaking


1632
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:15,926
out because their computer is


1633
00:51:15,926 --> 00:51:17,556
not working properly, and they


1634
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:18,616
changed something, and they


1635
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:19,776
don't really know what they did.


1636
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:22,646
This is why progressive


1637
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,906
disclosure is your best friend.


1638
00:51:25,856 --> 00:51:27,386
By keeping things simple for


1639
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:29,776
novices, they are less likely to


1640
00:51:29,776 --> 00:51:31,756
feel intimidated, overwhelmed,


1641
00:51:32,106 --> 00:51:33,466
or get themselves into trouble,


1642
00:51:33,996 --> 00:51:35,426
while more experienced users can


1643
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,216
quickly reveal the options and


1644
00:51:37,216 --> 00:51:39,516
actions that they require, that


1645
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:41,216
they understand, and that they


1646
00:51:41,216 --> 00:51:42,506
are capable of using.


1647
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:47,396
Okay. Anyhow, in case you were


1648
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,106
wondering, the cheeseburger and


1649
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,546
onion rings were delicious,


1650
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:52,256
thank you very much for asking.


1651
00:51:53,336 --> 00:51:55,686
Okay, so it is time for us to


1652
00:51:55,686 --> 00:51:56,406
get some sleep.


1653
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:58,046
We will be getting up early


1654
00:51:58,046 --> 00:51:59,136
tomorrow, and we are going to be


1655
00:51:59,136 --> 00:52:01,486
doing some snorkeling, so guys,


1656
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:01,906
rest up.


1657
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,796
Okay, did everyone sleep well?


1658
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:06,896
Was your room comfortable?


1659
00:52:06,896 --> 00:52:08,126
Were you able to turn on your


1660
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:09,306
lights successfully?


1661
00:52:09,636 --> 00:52:11,086
How is that Morty faucet?


1662
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,406
That was pretty weird, right?


1663
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,206
Okay, enough small talk.


1664
00:52:14,206 --> 00:52:15,866
It is time for us to go see some


1665
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:16,296
fish.


1666
00:52:16,796 --> 00:52:18,116
Now, after another highly


1667
00:52:18,156 --> 00:52:20,036
successful car ride, we get to


1668
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,806
the beach, and you put on your


1669
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:22,856
goggles, and you put on your


1670
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,616
flippers, you adjust your


1671
00:52:24,616 --> 00:52:26,696
snorkel just so, and you get


1672
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:27,786
into the water.


1673
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,526
Now, there are some tropical


1674
00:52:29,526 --> 00:52:30,236
fish.


1675
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:32,566
There is a blowfish.


1676
00:52:33,046 --> 00:52:35,096
There is a school of tuna fish.


1677
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,396
There is a giant squid, for some


1678
00:52:38,396 --> 00:52:40,606
reason, because I had the emoji


1679
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:41,796
[laughter].


1680
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:44,756
It is a magical underwater


1681
00:52:44,756 --> 00:52:45,486
wonderland.


1682
00:52:46,516 --> 00:52:49,666
It is so utterly beautiful, but


1683
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,096
why?


1684
00:52:51,506 --> 00:52:53,466
This brings us to our very last


1685
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:54,386
design principle.


1686
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:58,046
Symmetry. Symmetry is a concept


1687
00:52:58,046 --> 00:52:59,526
that we are all deeply familiar


1688
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:01,256
with, and when we think about


1689
00:53:01,256 --> 00:53:02,566
symmetry, we typically think


1690
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:04,756
about reflectional or bilateral


1691
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:05,296
symmetry.


1692
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:06,926
But there is more.


1693
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:09,436
There is also radial, and


1694
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,626
rotational symmetry.


1695
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:13,546
And there is also translational


1696
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:14,106
symmetry.


1697
00:53:16,096 --> 00:53:17,936
These three types of symmetry


1698
00:53:18,366 --> 00:53:19,656
are ubiquitous in nature.


1699
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:21,896
Symmetrical forms are efficient


1700
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,826
forms, and we tend to associate


1701
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,186
them with good health, with


1702
00:53:25,186 --> 00:53:27,026
stability, balance, and


1703
00:53:27,026 --> 00:53:27,846
orderliness.


1704
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,966
And we consider them to be


1705
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:32,136
aesthetically pleasing, probably


1706
00:53:32,136 --> 00:53:33,636
for very good evolutionary


1707
00:53:33,636 --> 00:53:34,286
reasons.


1708
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:37,016
Symmetrical elements, even if


1709
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:38,146
they are not physically


1710
00:53:38,146 --> 00:53:39,876
connected to each other, are


1711
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:41,726
perceived as though they are.


1712
00:53:42,506 --> 00:53:44,776
So when we see these two facing


1713
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:46,996
square brackets, our mind


1714
00:53:46,996 --> 00:53:48,796
unconsciously integrates them


1715
00:53:49,186 --> 00:53:51,696
into one coherent object.


1716
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:54,526
And as you swim around, you'll


1717
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,176
find all three forms of


1718
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:56,746
symmetry.


1719
00:53:57,906 --> 00:54:00,986
Bilateral symmetry, rotational


1720
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:03,676
symmetry, and translational


1721
00:54:03,676 --> 00:54:04,146
symmetry.


1722
00:54:05,236 --> 00:54:07,026
As a matter of fact, just about


1723
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:08,526
every type of plant or animal,


1724
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:11,166
both in the sea, in the water,


1725
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:12,776
on land, in the air,


1726
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:14,936
demonstrates one or more types


1727
00:54:14,976 --> 00:54:15,696
of symmetry.


1728
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:18,216
And most human-made objects do


1729
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:18,746
as well.


1730
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:21,396
Light switches are symmetrical


1731
00:54:21,396 --> 00:54:23,426
across both the horizontal and


1732
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,326
vertical axes.


1733
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:26,996
Faucets are symmetrical.


1734
00:54:27,756 --> 00:54:29,506
And cars are symmetrical.


1735
00:54:29,506 --> 00:54:31,636
[Laughs] Now there is obviously


1736
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:34,406
some very practical functional


1737
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:36,626
reasons why cars are


1738
00:54:36,626 --> 00:54:37,336
symmetrical.


1739
00:54:37,996 --> 00:54:40,846
I mean, there is a very rational


1740
00:54:40,846 --> 00:54:42,126
reason why you don't want to get


1741
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:44,066
into that car.


1742
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:47,386
But there are clearly aesthetic


1743
00:54:47,386 --> 00:54:48,326
benefits as well.


1744
00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:51,036
Attractive interfaces tend to


1745
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:52,446
demonstrate a mixture of


1746
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:54,236
reflectional and translational


1747
00:54:54,236 --> 00:54:54,786
symmetry.


1748
00:54:55,246 --> 00:54:56,716
In the Weather app, reflectional


1749
00:54:56,716 --> 00:54:58,106
symmetry provides a sense of


1750
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:58,716
balance.


1751
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:01,116
Key elements are centered along


1752
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:03,526
a median line, while almost all


1753
00:55:03,526 --> 00:55:04,526
of the other elements are


1754
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:05,856
counter-balanced with each


1755
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:06,116
other.


1756
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:08,306
This is a pattern which is


1757
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:10,216
reflected in apps like the


1758
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:14,246
Camera app, the Clock app, and


1759
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:16,496
the Phone app, and many, many


1760
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:16,816
more.


1761
00:55:18,216 --> 00:55:20,276
Translational symmetry gives an


1762
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,136
interface a sense of structure,


1763
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:24,166
and order through the repetition


1764
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,356
of like elements.


1765
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:27,486
You can see translational


1766
00:55:27,486 --> 00:55:29,366
symmetry in the even repetition


1767
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:31,126
of cities and times in the Clock


1768
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:33,876
app, or the even cadence of


1769
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:35,346
locations in the Weather app.


1770
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:37,676
When laying out your app's


1771
00:55:37,676 --> 00:55:39,146
interface, look for


1772
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:41,586
opportunities to use symmetry to


1773
00:55:41,586 --> 00:55:43,206
provide a sense of balance and


1774
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:43,556
order.


1775
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:47,536
Okay, so, everyone, I am sorry


1776
00:55:47,536 --> 00:55:48,736
to be the bearer of bad news,


1777
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,786
but it's time for us to get out


1778
00:55:50,786 --> 00:55:51,306
of the water.


1779
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,706
There are a lot of you, and we


1780
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:53,816
can only pay for a half day


1781
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:54,076
trip.


1782
00:55:54,746 --> 00:55:56,206
Also, I don't know if you saw,


1783
00:55:56,206 --> 00:55:57,496
there was a shark in the water,


1784
00:55:57,496 --> 00:55:58,626
and I am really starting to


1785
00:55:58,626 --> 00:55:59,086
freak out.


1786
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:03,496
So we return back to sunny San


1787
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:03,936
Jose.


1788
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:06,186
Now, the snorkeling here is not


1789
00:56:06,186 --> 00:56:07,606
quite as beautiful as Hawaii,


1790
00:56:07,606 --> 00:56:09,506
and I strongly urge you not to


1791
00:56:09,506 --> 00:56:10,246
go into the bay.


1792
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:12,096
But our technical and design


1793
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,516
content is way better, so it's a


1794
00:56:14,516 --> 00:56:14,966
win-win.


1795
00:56:15,846 --> 00:56:17,226
Now, the design principles that


1796
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:18,836
we explored today express


1797
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:21,126
fundamental truths about human


1798
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,616
perception and cognition.


1799
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:25,466
They are simple, but powerful


1800
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,536
reminders about the true nature


1801
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:29,376
and purpose of design.


1802
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:31,806
They provide a framework for


1803
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,796
understanding, and a language


1804
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:36,136
for articulating a design's


1805
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,486
strengths and its shortcomings.


1806
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,336
My hope is that in sharing these


1807
00:56:41,336 --> 00:56:42,806
principles with you today, you


1808
00:56:43,746 --> 00:56:45,496
will come away with a clear


1809
00:56:45,496 --> 00:56:48,256
sense of how your app's designs


1810
00:56:48,736 --> 00:56:50,966
can help to fulfill those basic


1811
00:56:50,966 --> 00:56:53,066
needs that we all share.


1812
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:55,356
The need to feel safe.


1813
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:57,256
The need to understand.


1814
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:59,376
The need to achieve our goals,


1815
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:01,306
and the need to experience


1816
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:02,946
beauty and joy.


1817
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:05,826
Now, to be sure, while these


1818
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:07,146
principles are, in many ways,


1819
00:57:07,146 --> 00:57:08,566
quite simple, applying them to


1820
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:09,926
your work is not.


1821
00:57:11,156 --> 00:57:12,486
Each of these principles could


1822
00:57:12,486 --> 00:57:13,686
lead you into different


1823
00:57:13,686 --> 00:57:15,486
directions about what you should


1824
00:57:15,486 --> 00:57:17,066
do with the design of your app.


1825
00:57:18,116 --> 00:57:20,196
Designing is so often about


1826
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:21,776
resolving those differences.


1827
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:23,896
This is something that the very


1828
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:25,526
best designers struggle with.


1829
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:28,676
It is also possible to have too


1830
00:57:28,676 --> 00:57:29,566
much of a good thing.


1831
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:31,376
Too much feedback is annoying.


1832
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:32,896
Too much visibility is


1833
00:57:32,936 --> 00:57:33,556
distracting.


1834
00:57:33,836 --> 00:57:35,486
Too much progressive disclosure


1835
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,596
can make work flows inefficient.


1836
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:39,866
So you have to be measured in


1837
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:41,846
your approach, and exercise


1838
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:43,646
judgment and discretion.


1839
00:57:44,696 --> 00:57:46,006
And the relevance of each


1840
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:48,096
principle can vary depending on


1841
00:57:48,096 --> 00:57:49,596
what kind of app you're making.


1842
00:57:50,606 --> 00:57:52,376
Platform. Screen size.


1843
00:57:52,776 --> 00:57:55,556
Use case. The experience level


1844
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:56,356
of the people who you are


1845
00:57:56,356 --> 00:57:57,256
designing for.


1846
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,816
These factors and more should


1847
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:01,736
influence what principles are


1848
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:03,616
most relevant at any given


1849
00:58:03,616 --> 00:58:03,986
moment.


1850
00:58:05,076 --> 00:58:06,636
Working through this can be


1851
00:58:06,636 --> 00:58:07,266
challenging.


1852
00:58:07,996 --> 00:58:09,276
No one said that designing is


1853
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:11,966
easy, but I do not want you to


1854
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:12,986
be discouraged.


1855
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:15,576
Designing is a lot easier when


1856
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,926
you understand the fundamentals.


1857
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,456
Let these principles be your


1858
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,416
North Star.


1859
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:23,386
They will guide you toward


1860
00:58:23,386 --> 00:58:25,946
making apps that better serve


1861
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:27,996
the human beings that you are


1862
00:58:27,996 --> 00:58:28,876
designing for.


1863
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:31,396
And that is the thing that


1864
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:32,366
matters most.


1865
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,406
And in turn, the people that you


1866
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:36,516
are designing for will


1867
00:58:36,516 --> 00:58:39,366
recognize, on some level, all of


1868
00:58:39,366 --> 00:58:40,846
the hard work that you have


1869
00:58:40,846 --> 00:58:41,456
invested.


1870
00:58:42,046 --> 00:58:43,306
They will appreciate the


1871
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:46,236
thoughtfulness and care, and


1872
00:58:46,586 --> 00:58:49,216
they will sense the humanity of


1873
00:58:49,336 --> 00:58:51,526
the people who made it.


1874
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:55,186
Okay, so for more information,


1875
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:56,256
check out this URL.


1876
00:58:56,786 --> 00:58:58,966
And, I want to highlight how


1877
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,656
many amazing design sessions we


1878
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:01,416
have for you this week.


1879
00:59:01,826 --> 00:59:03,946
We actually have eight design


1880
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:06,246
sessions, which is more than we


1881
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:07,186
have ever done before.


1882
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:08,556
We have three sessions that have


1883
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:10,986
five mini sessions in them each.


1884
00:59:10,986 --> 00:59:12,256
There is a lot of fantastic


1885
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:12,736
content.


1886
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:14,466
In particular, I want to


1887
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:16,286
highlight a couple of sessions.


1888
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:18,426
One is called Designing Sound.


1889
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:21,216
It is being given by the person


1890
00:59:21,216 --> 00:59:22,736
who makes basically all the


1891
00:59:22,736 --> 00:59:24,286
sounds that are on your devices.


1892
00:59:24,596 --> 00:59:26,376
It is nothing, like nothing we


1893
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:27,256
have ever done before.


1894
00:59:27,576 --> 00:59:28,556
It is really fantastic.


1895
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:29,496
It is this afternoon.


1896
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,656
And you should go check out


1897
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:33,546
tomorrow, a presentation called


1898
00:59:33,546 --> 00:59:35,076
Designing Across Platforms,


1899
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:37,266
which helps to solve really


1900
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:39,266
tricky issues about how to adapt


1901
00:59:39,266 --> 00:59:41,096
