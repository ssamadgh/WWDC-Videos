2
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:21,376
>> Hi. I'm Todd Ritland,
AirPrint engineer


3
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:23,606
and the lead engineer
on iOS printing.


4
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:27,166
And this is Deploying
AirPrint in Enterprise.


5
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,356
AirPrint is Apple's
total printing solution.


6
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:34,556
It's a technology that helps you


7
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:37,476
to create full-quality
printed output without the need


8
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:39,236
to download or install drivers.


9
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,516
If you're an app developer
and want to add printing


10
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:46,426
to your app, see
developer.apple.com/airprint


11
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:51,106
for a previous talk I gave at
WWDC titled Advances in AirPrint


12
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:53,566
and download the sample
code to get started.


13
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:56,326
If you are a printer
manufacturer


14
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,566
or a print server
developer and wish


15
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,726
to license AirPrint
technology for your product,


16
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,766
please email airprint@apple.com.


17
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,636
This talk will focus on
those who are responsible


18
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:09,516
for deploying AirPrint
and want to learn more


19
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,056
about all the enterprise
features


20
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:13,616
that make AirPrint work great
in enterprise environments.


21
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,626
Printing in enterprise has
many unique requirements.


22
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,026
Our enterprise customers
are dealing with a fleet


23
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:24,226
of printers, often
from many manufacturers


24
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:27,376
and with different features,
across floors of buildings


25
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:28,926
or across many different
buildings,


26
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:30,536
and in many locations.


27
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,716
These can be hugely
complex printers as well.


28
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:38,316
The network infrastructure
is often very complex.


29
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,756
Often they're wireless
and wired clients


30
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:45,076
and their network
structure may be unrelated


31
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,806
to the physical location
in a building.


32
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:51,706
IT departments also have
varying network requirements,


33
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,756
such as no access
to software update,


34
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:56,286
no multicast packet
traffic allowed,


35
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,366
and certain ports blocks, which
all have impact on printers.


36
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:04,596
Enterprise customers also may
have accounting requirements


37
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,906
since every page
printed costs money.


38
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:12,436
And of course security
requirements are essential


39
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,516
and are increasingly important
in enterprise printing.


40
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:22,446
The top requests we get from
enterprise are the ability


41
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:27,276
to create PDF and have more
paper-free workflows, security,


42
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:29,436
access control and accounting,


43
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,806
and better discovery
of printers.


44
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,596
So let's go into
what AirPrint offers


45
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:35,836
for each of these in detail.


46
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:40,386
First, create PDF
from the Print panel.


47
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,646
Mac OS has long had the ability


48
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,056
to get a PDF anywhere
you can print.


49
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:49,666
And now in iOS 10, all iOS
devices have this ability


50
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,976
as well and I'd like to
show you how this works.


51
00:02:56,116 --> 00:03:00,716
Here we have an iPad running
iOS 10, and when I tap Print,


52
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:04,576
I just pinch out with my two
fingers on the Print Preview.


53
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,976
And from here, I have a Share
button at the top corner.


54
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,756
Any app can accept PDFs will
appear under the Share menu,


55
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:17,486
as well as AirDrop and other
system-sharing options.


56
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:22,166
This also works with the Managed
Open In Enterprise feature


57
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,736
that keeps business items
and personal items separate.


58
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,966
On devices with 3D Touch, you
can alternatively use the Peek


59
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:32,776
and Pop gesture to
access this same view


60
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:33,696
from the Print Preview.


61
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,586
We think enterprise users will
love having this new paper-free


62
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:40,206
workflow on all of
their iOS devices.


63
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:46,496
Next onto a hugely
important topic, security.


64
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:52,546
AirPrint on iOS and Mac
OS support full end-to-end


65
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:55,126
encryption so your documents
are protected on the network.


66
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,386
AirPrint supports the latest
industry standard TLS 1.2


67
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,206
encryption on top of HTTP.


68
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:06,066
This encryption technology
is a requirement


69
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,206
for all new AirPrint
printers and servers.


70
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,366
Next, for additional security,


71
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,565
many enterprise customers don't
want printed pages sitting


72
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:18,156
around in the output
bin of a printer,


73
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:23,496
where an unauthorized person
can pick it up and view it.


74
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,516
iOS and Mac OS support PIN
Release for printers and servers


75
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,316
that support it, where the user
will enter a PIN at the printer


76
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:31,606
to receive their output.


77
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:35,576
On iOS, when a PIN is required,


78
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:38,686
the Print panel has a
label explaining that.


79
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:42,896
And when the user taps
Print, an alert is displayed


80
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:43,976
with the PIN to release the job.


81
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:53,646
On Mac OS, the user can
type the PIN they want


82
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,726
to use to release the job.


83
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:59,496
Mac OS also supports
PIN when PIN is optional


84
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,706
and not required to print.


85
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,506
Next, Access Control
and Accounting.


86
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,726
AirPrint has always
supported printers and servers


87
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:10,446
that require authentication
with a username and password.


88
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,456
We store the username and
password entered in the keychain


89
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,616
so the user never has
to enter it again.


90
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,836
iOS 10 now supports
the ability to forget


91
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,876
that stored authentication
information to support workflows


92
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:24,976
where a different
user name is needed.


93
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:33,836
Also new this year is support
for password-only authentication


94
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,246
so printer can be protected


95
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:36,976
with just a simple
password, as shown here.


96
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,756
When an enterprise
needs to have billing


97
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:46,736
or account information
added to each print job,


98
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,596
iOS and Mac OS both support
printers and servers that take


99
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:51,776
that account information.


100
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:55,456
If the account information
is required for every job,


101
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,676
the user will be
required to enter


102
00:05:57,676 --> 00:05:58,946
that information before
the job continues.


103
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,816
And iOS and Mac OS
support either optional


104
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,186
or required account
ID for print jobs,


105
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:10,976
and this is what the UI
looks like on Mac OS X.


106
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:19,886
Next, Better Discovery.


107
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:25,426
AirPrint has many supportive
ways to find and use printers.


108
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:27,926
The main method which
most people associate


109
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,586
with AirPrint is Local Bonjour.


110
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:31,976
There is no setup required.


111
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,056
The printer automatically
appears as an available printer


112
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,336
in the list without any setup.


113
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,516
AirPrint has also always
supported Wide-Area Bonjour.


114
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:45,546
Bonjour is based on
DNS Service Discovery.


115
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:47,556
And if a DNS server
is configured


116
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:48,636
with the correct records,


117
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,946
printers can be discovered
this way


118
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:52,616
and I'll go over how to do this.


119
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:58,526
Both iOS and Mac OS also now
support Mobile Device Management


120
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:01,836
or MDM profiles with a
configured AirPrint payload.


121
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:07,816
And new in iOS 10, we have
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacons


122
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,976
as a way to discover
printers using Bluetooth


123
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,796
low-energy beacons.


124
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,336
Configuring a DNS server


125
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,176
to advertise AirPrint
printers is easy.


126
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,516
First, the configured DNS
server must be in the list


127
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,956
of DNS servers used
by the iOS devices


128
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,566
and Macs you want
printers to appear.


129
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,186
There are lots of ways to
manage which DNS servers


130
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:34,686
and search domains are used,
such as DHCP or MDM profiles.


131
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:41,446
And next you want to add A
or AAAA records to the name


132
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:44,876
of the printer and the printer
setup with a static IP address.


133
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:50,066
Add a PTR record for the
main IPPS service type


134
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:53,136
and one additional PTR record
for the universal subtype.


135
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,046
This is key for AirPrint
because AirPrint isn't just an


136
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:57,916
IPPS service.


137
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,316
It has a subtype of universal


138
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,126
and that's what iOS
devices and Mac search for.


139
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:09,526
You'll add a SRV record for
the service and than a TXT


140
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:12,406
or text record that
describes many capabilities


141
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:13,556
and information about
the printer.


142
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:18,336
It's super important to
find the TXT or text record


143
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:19,426
of the printer or server,


144
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,626
which can easily be accomplished
using the Command Line tool Mac


145
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:24,116
OS, dns-sd.


146
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:30,796
To use dns-sd to figure out the
records, just run this command


147
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:33,006
on the same subnet as the
printer you're setting up.


148
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:37,076
You run with the -Z option
to display the records


149
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:41,405
in zone file format and
you'll use the underscore tcp.


150
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:45,916
underscore ipps.service
type in the local domain,


151
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,256
like shown here in blue.


152
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,806
This is the output you'll get


153
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,676
for each printer that's
discovered locally.


154
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:58,176
These are almost the PTR, SRV,
and TXT records you'll need


155
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,996
to add to DNS server
with a couple additions.


156
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,246
The changes are highlighted
here in green.


157
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:08,456
As I mentioned, you'll add
an additional PTR record


158
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,836
for the universal subtype, like
this one on the second line.


159
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,086
You'll also replace the local
printer name in the SRV record


160
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,116
with the fully-qualified
domain name,


161
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:22,326
the A record I mentioned
earlier, and you'll also need


162
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:25,296
to replace any other instances
of the local Bonjour name


163
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:28,706
with this fully-qualified domain
name, like I have shown here


164
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:31,026
in green, with the
printer's administration URL.


165
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:35,846
If this isn't fixed, users
won't be able to use the button


166
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:38,116
in Mac OS that quickly
takes them


167
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,786
to the printer's admin webpage.


168
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:43,766
And so this is the text here
that could be copied right


169
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:46,616
into a zone file and a
printer will appear in the list


170
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:47,836
of printers for your users,


171
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:50,056
if they have this
DNS server configured


172
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,816
as one of their DNS servers.


173
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:55,166
So the key to setting up
Wide-Area Bonjour printers is


174
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,246
to get some help from the
dns-sd Command Line tool.


175
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,796
MDM profiles are very
popular and a super easy way


176
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:06,376
to configure printers
for your users.


177
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,736
The AirPrint payload can
be added to any profile


178
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:12,016
and that payload
consists of a host


179
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:14,336
or IP address and
a resource path.


180
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:20,036
The resource path is ipp/print
for most AirPrint printers,


181
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,866
and for an AirPrint server,
this will be the queue.


182
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:27,846
And the screenshot shown
here is Apple Configurator,


183
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:31,016
one of the most popular Mobile
Device Management tools.


184
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:35,746
Next we have a new
technology we're really excited


185
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:37,306
about that's new in iOS 10


186
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,266
and that's the AirPrint
Bluetooth Beacon.


187
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,766
So what is an AirPrint Bluetooth
Beacon, and how does it work?


188
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,476
Well, it can be configured
using one


189
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,936
of the many third-party
Bluetooth beacon devices


190
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:53,806
available on the market and
set next to or near a printer


191
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,116
or can it be built into the
printer itself using the


192
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,036
printer's built-in
radios and antennas.


193
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,226
And future AirPrint printers
will have this capability built


194
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:03,986
right in.


195
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:07,336
What it does is beacon out
the connection information.


196
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:11,546
And if the iPhone can
reach that IP address,


197
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:14,686
the printer will be
accessible to send jobs to.


198
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,436
This is really powerful
because the network complexities


199
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:19,096
don't matter.


200
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,666
All that matters is that
the IP address is reachable.


201
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:25,146
This could even be a public
IP address on the Internet.


202
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,206
So long as the iOS device
is in Bluetooth range


203
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,206
and the IP address
is accessible,


204
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,836
the printer will show up
as an available printer


205
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:32,996
on the list for users.


206
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:38,546
And the AirPrint Beacon works
great with print servers too.


207
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:44,046
Here we have an AirPrint server
on the right, and each printer


208
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,266
on the network has an
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon


209
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,076
which is advertising
the server's IP address


210
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:51,616
and the Queue ID
associated with that printer.


211
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:56,726
When the user prints, the
job goes to the print server


212
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:02,716
with the queue information, and
then the server sends the job


213
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:05,496
to the associated printer that
the user has chosen in the UI.


214
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,816
Let's go into detail about what
the AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon


215
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:14,356
format is so you can set
these up for your printers.


216
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,316
First, we have a header.


217
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:23,516
This is what identifies this BLE
beacon as an AirPrint Beacon.


218
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:27,046
It's the same for all
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacons,


219
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,306
so this can just be copied.


220
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:32,486
Next, we have the
connection information.


221
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:35,036
This tells whether the
IP address found later


222
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:38,586
in the beacon is an IPv4
address or an IPv6 address.


223
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:42,216
It also tells whether the
IP address is for a server


224
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,836
or identifies a printer
and this byte identifies


225
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:47,026
if the connection
must be TLS encrypted.


226
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:51,006
For this example, the
connection is TLS encrypted,


227
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:54,186
the IP address is
an IPv6 address,


228
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:55,816
and this is not a server.


229
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:00,786
See the specification
published on developer.apple.com


230
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:02,646
for how this byte is set up.


231
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,976
Next we have a printer
ID if this job should go


232
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:11,896
to a print server or information
about the resource path


233
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,266
if this is directly
to a printer.


234
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:18,156
This printer has ipp/print
as the resource path.


235
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:22,936
Again, see the specification
published for more details


236
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,356
about specifying resource paths.


237
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:29,906
Next we have the port
for the connection;


238
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:33,536
631 is the standard IPP port.


239
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,736
Port 443 is often used for
TLS secure connections.


240
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:43,456
For this example, 277
is hexadecimal for 631,


241
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,466
which is the standard IPP port.


242
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:50,186
And next we have the IP address.


243
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:55,326
If you're using a non-updatable
external beacon for the printer,


244
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:57,716
make sure the printer
has a static IP address.


245
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:01,036
Otherwise, this IP in the
beacon will become stale


246
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,486
when the IP address changes.


247
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:09,276
And last, like iBeacon, we have
a measured signal strength value


248
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:10,076
at 1 meter.


249
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,536
This uses the same methodology
as Apple iBeacon measured power.


250
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,606
This gives the iOS
device better information


251
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,216
about the physical
distance of the printer.


252
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:23,536
For this example, the
transmission power was found


253
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:27,666
to be on average 64 decibels,
which is 40 in hexadecimal.


254
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,106
The format of the AirPrint
Bluetooth Beacon is somewhat


255
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:33,116
similar to iBeacon.


256
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:37,406
iBeacon format is
one byte shorter,


257
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,556
but the beginning
header is very similar.


258
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:43,396
If you're following setup
instructions for a device


259
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:46,636
with iBeacon technology,
you may be able to adjust


260
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,436
and use a similar setup for
the AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon,


261
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,036
and many manufacturers of
Bluetooth hardware have


262
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:56,406
or will have specific
AirPrint Bluetooth Beacon


263
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:57,536
setup procedures.


264
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,016
So for enterprise users, iOS


265
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,286
and Mac OS provides
many great technologies


266
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:07,576
to support PDF workflows for
an increasingly digital world.


267
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:11,856
And AirPrint provides great
security, access control,


268
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:14,486
accounting, and new
discovery technologies


269
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,456
to make printing great
in any environment.


270
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,736
