[ Applause ]


2
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:23,596
>> Morning.


3
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:28,146
Welcome to Advances in TVMLKit.


4
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:29,146
I'm Trevor.


5
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:30,486
I work in Localization, and


6
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:31,526
later, I'll be joined by my


7
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:32,936
colleagues, Parry and Jeremy,


8
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:33,866
from tvOS.


9
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,656
Today, we are really excited to


10
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,146
talk to you about three new


11
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:39,586
advances that we have made.


12
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:41,226
TVMLKit is Apple's developer


13
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:42,586
framework for building native


14
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:45,246
applications for Apple TV using


15
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,356
JavaScript and a markup language


16
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:48,646
that we call TVML.


17
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:52,716
I am going to get things started


18
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:54,146
by talking about right-to-left


19
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:54,786
languages.


20
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,866
Then Parry will show us how to


21
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:57,876
take advantage of new


22
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:59,426
optimizations in your templates,


23
00:00:59,696 --> 00:01:01,066
to take performance to the next


24
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:01,376
level.


25
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:03,456
Finally, Jeremy will show us


26
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:04,995
some awesome new features that


27
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,376
you can use in the Web Inspector


28
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:07,286
to make debugging your


29
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,826
applications easier than ever.


30
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,636
So let's dive right in with


31
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,896
right-to-left language support.


32
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:16,456
Arabic and Hebrew are


33
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:17,996
newly-selectable languages in


34
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:18,946
tvOS 11.


35
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,386
With over 400 million speakers


36
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:23,806
worldwide, this is a huge


37
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:25,436
opportunity for you developers


38
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,106
to reach new audiences with your


39
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:28,416
app.


40
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,626
Now, what makes Arabic and


41
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:30,846
Hebrew different compared to


42
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:31,986
other languages you might be


43
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:33,556
supporting already is that they


44
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:35,156
are written and read from right


45
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:35,646
to left.


46
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:37,646
Let's take a look at some


47
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:38,786
examples, so we can really


48
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:40,066
understand what that means for


49
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,036
your applications.


50
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:46,846
What you see here is our product


51
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:47,926
template in a left-to-right


52
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,126
language, and it looks really


53
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:51,256
normal to most of you in the


54
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:51,826
audience.


55
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,446
The text is aligned on the left,


56
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:55,226
the content is flowing from the


57
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:56,376
left side of the screen to the


58
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,426
right side of the screen.


59
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,126
You see the focus is on the


60
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:00,186
first button, which is the


61
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:00,966
left-most button.


62
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,446
So, when you take this template,


63
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:04,846
and you load it in a


64
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,376
right-to-left language, for


65
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,406
example, Hebrew, you see the


66
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:09,466
content is mirrored.


67
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,606
It is now flowing from the right


68
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:12,786
side of the screen to the left


69
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:13,526
side of the screen.


70
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:15,146
Our text is aligned to the


71
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:15,476
right.


72
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,106
Our focus is still on the first


73
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:18,326
button, but now you see it is on


74
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:19,016
the other side.


75
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,386
Let's look at another example.


76
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:24,976
Here, we have the catalogue


77
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:27,146
template, and again, it looks


78
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,646
very normal and natural if you


79
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:29,986
are a reader of a left-to-right


80
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:30,536
language.


81
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,026
So when you look at this same


82
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,396
example in a right-to-left


83
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:35,126
language, you see that the


84
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,676
content is mirrored again.


85
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,196
It is flowing from right to


86
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:38,626
left.


87
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:40,016
The first image is still the


88
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:41,106
desert, but it is on the other


89
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:41,876
side of the screen.


90
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,136
So that is how these apps look


91
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:46,056
in right-to-left languages, and


92
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:47,276
as you can see from these


93
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:48,416
examples, we've built the


94
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,896
support into TVMLKit.


95
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,036
So when you're using the default


96
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,306
templates, you get the support


97
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,836
for free in your apps.


98
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:57,946
Now, supporting a right-to-left


99
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,756
language works the same way as


100
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:01,026
supporting any other languages


101
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:01,486
in your app.


102
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,816
You need to go into X code in


103
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,646
your project settings, and in


104
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:07,996
the localizations, just add


105
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,336
Arabic or Hebrew, which are


106
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,366
supported languages.


107
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:13,946
This is really key to make sure


108
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,696
that TVMLKit knows when to


109
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,616
render these views at


110
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:17,786
right-to-left at run time.


111
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,846
And for more coverage about


112
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:20,866
everything that it takes to


113
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,146
support localizations in your


114
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,396
apps, including localizing


115
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:24,516
content and dealing with


116
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,946
formatters for dates and times,


117
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,606
I recommend checking out this


118
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,266
year's talk, Localizing With X


119
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,646
Code 9, which goes into much


120
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,086
greater detail.


121
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,036
So the default templates work


122
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,856
out of the box, but what if you


123
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:38,526
have custom views, and you want


124
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:39,946
to customize the behavior beyond


125
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:40,696
those templates.


126
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:42,666
Well in tvOS 11 we have


127
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,456
introduced three specific areas


128
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,956
where you can customize layout,


129
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:49,316
text alignment and images.


130
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,356
Let's get started with layout.


131
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,296
Today, you might be customizing


132
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:56,456
your layout using tv-align, and


133
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:57,476
tv-position, and you are


134
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:59,446
probably using values of left


135
00:03:59,446 --> 00:03:59,846
and right.


136
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:01,946
Well, for right-to-left


137
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:03,836
languages, left becomes left and


138
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,516
right becomes left, or something


139
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:07,366
like that, so you need to take


140
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:10,076
care to use the right direction.


141
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,436
And for that, we've introduced


142
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:12,446
leading and trailing.


143
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:14,496
Leading and trailing will


144
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:15,796
automatically resolve to the


145
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,336
corresponding values of left and


146
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:18,676
right at run time, based on the


147
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,486
running language of your


148
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:20,055
application.


149
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,096
So, for example, if you have a


150
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,156
style defined where you're


151
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:24,806
setting a tv-position to right


152
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:26,946
or tv-align to left, just


153
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:28,216
replace those values with


154
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:29,246
trailing and leading.


155
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,336
This is going to ensure that in


156
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:32,506
your left-to-right language,


157
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,716
everything looks exactly the


158
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:35,596
same, but in a right-to-left


159
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:37,016
language, content is flowing


160
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:37,476
correctly.


161
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:41,726
For values of margin and


162
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:43,166
padding, we've introduced a


163
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,386
brand-new media query in tvOS 11


164
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,336
called Layout Direction.


165
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:49,366
You might already be using media


166
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:51,166
queries today for customizing


167
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,336
your appearance for light and


168
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:52,636
dark.


169
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,166
These work just the same way.


170
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:56,016
Any styles that you define


171
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,906
inside the media query will be


172
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,706
active for that media query.


173
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:02,336
So, here in our example, we have


174
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,786
two styles defined, one in our


175
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:06,406
LTR layout direction, left to


176
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,256
right, and one in our RTL layout


177
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:08,696
direction.


178
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:11,396
And we take care to ensure that


179
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,466
any horizontal values are


180
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:15,106
flipped according to the side


181
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,016
that they need to be on.


182
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:17,556
So here, in our example, our


183
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:19,136
margin of 12 needs to be on the


184
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,756
correct side of the element.


185
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,556
So that's layout.


186
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,356
What about text direction?


187
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:28,446
So for alignment, you're used to


188
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,436
using things like left, center


189
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:30,856
and right.


190
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:32,526
And when you look at the text on


191
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:34,536
the screen, two kind of jump out


192
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:35,826
to you as a more natural


193
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,676
presentation for a left-to-right


194
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:39,086
language, left alignment is


195
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,776
natural, and for a right-to-left


196
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:42,066
language, right alignment is


197
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:42,516
natural.


198
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,216
So, for that, we got with our


199
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,436
marketing team and thought


200
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:48,666
really deeply about what kind of


201
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:50,256
term could we use here, and we


202
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:51,596
came up with a new value for


203
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:52,826
text alignment of natural.


204
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:55,096
Natural does just what you'd


205
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:55,936
expect it to do.


206
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,616
It aligns a text naturally based


207
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,006
on the UI language of your app.


208
00:05:59,506 --> 00:05:59,956
Easy stuff.


209
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,156
When it comes to images in your


210
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,126
apps, the majority of the images


211
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:07,296
you have are universal.


212
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:08,586
They are appropriate to show for


213
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:09,566
any layout direction.


214
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:12,076
But in some cases, an image has


215
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,906
an implied directionality, like


216
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,336
this Chevron at the end of a


217
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:15,956
list item.


218
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,636
In this case, it's really


219
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:18,706
important that the arrow is


220
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:19,626
pointing in the correct


221
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:21,436
direction, otherwise it would


222
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:22,896
look really weird and probably


223
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:23,366
broken.


224
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:26,086
So there's two ways that you can


225
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,316
support these in your apps.


226
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,006
The first is for resource


227
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:29,576
images.


228
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,186
Images that are coming from


229
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:32,626
inside your application bundle


230
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,916
can be specified in asset


231
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,576
catalogs, which provide a really


232
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:39,706
convenient way for customizing


233
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,946
if the image is fixed for all


234
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,446
layout directions, can be


235
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,066
graphically mirrored at runtime,


236
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:46,946
like our chevron, or if we


237
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,486
needed a dedicated asset for


238
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:49,546
each language.


239
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:53,896
For images that are coming from


240
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,916
your server, we have a brand new


241
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,246
attribute that you can set on


242
00:06:58,246 --> 00:06:59,396
your image elements, called


243
00:06:59,396 --> 00:06:59,906
Source Set.


244
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:02,376
Source Set allows you to


245
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:04,906
identify a given URL for a given


246
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:05,706
layout direction.


247
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:07,826
What's great about Source Set is


248
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,116
that you can also use these for


249
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:10,706
customizing your appearances for


250
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:11,336
light and dark.


251
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:15,346
So here URL one will be loaded


252
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,126
when my layout direction is LTR,


253
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,046
and URL2 will be loaded when my


254
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:21,296
layout direction is RTL.


255
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:23,306
So this is a really concise way


256
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:24,856
for you to just define a single


257
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,406
image, and have the correct


258
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:29,006
thing happen at runtime.


259
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:30,476
So I'd like to see if we can


260
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:31,846
take all of these pieces and put


261
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,026
them together with a little


262
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:33,706
sample app that I've been


263
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:33,936
working on.


264
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,876
So I've been working on an app


265
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:48,186
that lets me showcase the WWDC


266
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:49,516
sessions from last year's


267
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,096
conference, and I'd love to show


268
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:51,506
it to you now.


269
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,436
So here you can see I have a


270
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,346
grid of the past sessions, and


271
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,656
at the top, I have a banner,


272
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:07,976
where I have a featured session.


273
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:11,026
So before I want to support a


274
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:12,106
right-to-left language in my


275
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:14,116
app, I can do a few things


276
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:15,026
without even adding a


277
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:15,786
localization.


278
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:21,056
In the edit scheme, in our run


279
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:22,966
options, I can change the


280
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:24,826
application language from the


281
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:25,966
system language to a


282
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:27,286
right-to-left pseudolanguage.


283
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:29,476
This lets me simulate what it's


284
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,366
going to be like in a


285
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:31,796
right-to-left language without


286
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:32,996
having to change anything about


287
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:33,645
my project.


288
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:36,466
So now, when I build and run,


289
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,466
you see our grid is now flowing


290
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,395
from right to left.


291
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,635
So because we're using a grid,


292
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:42,976
we get that support for free


293
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:43,696
from our template.


294
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,616
But because my banner was


295
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,146
custom, that I added with my own


296
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:48,816
styles, looks like I still have


297
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:49,426
some work to do.


298
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,436
So let's see if I can apply the


299
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:53,746
new API in tvOS 11 to fix these


300
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:54,196
problems?


301
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,056
The first thing that I'm going


302
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:59,126
to do is check my style in my


303
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:01,126
TVML and replace all of my


304
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:03,936
hard-coded references of left to


305
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,656
leading, which is the left side


306
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,036
of the screen in my development


307
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:07,496
language.


308
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,836
Similarly, I'll replace my


309
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,776
values of right with trailing.


310
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,636
Now, when I build and run my


311
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:17,176
app, hopefully we will have some


312
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:17,816
progress.


313
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,736
So great, looks like our text


314
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:22,676
has now flipped to the other


315
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:24,366
side, and our play button is on


316
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,366
the right side of the screen,


317
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:27,356
but it seems like it's a little


318
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,896
bit too close to the edge.


319
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:31,996
If I look at my style, my banner


320
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:33,626
play button lockup has a custom


321
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:34,766
margin that is applied to the


322
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:35,706
right side of the element.


323
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,426
We need to make sure that margin


324
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:38,656
is on the other side when we are


325
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:39,626
running in right to left.


326
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:43,116
To save time, I added a snippet


327
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,686
earlier that defines the two


328
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:46,496
media queries for my Banner Play


329
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:48,686
Button Lockup for LTR and RTL.


330
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:51,576
I'm going to move my definition


331
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:54,646
of the margin into the LTR, and


332
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,326
in my RTL definition, I'm going


333
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:59,036
to swap the horizontal position


334
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,276
of that 60.


335
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,896
Now, when I build and run, looks


336
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,076
like our play button has the


337
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:07,636
right padding.


338
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:09,876
So we are nearly there, but


339
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,356
looking at this app now, we can


340
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:12,766
kind of see that the text is on


341
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:13,406
the other side.


342
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,826
It is a little hard to read with


343
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:16,126
that image right underneath it.


344
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,426
So my designer gave me an


345
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:19,826
alternate asset that I can use


346
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,176
in my right-to-left languages,


347
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,006
so I can add that to my project,


348
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,756
since I'm using Asset Catalogs.


349
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:26,966
Here, in my Asset Catalogue, I


350
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,436
have a single image defined for


351
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:29,906
my banner, and then in the


352
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:31,796
attribute inspector, I can


353
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,416
change the direction from fixed


354
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,106
to both.


355
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:36,346
This now gives me a well where I


356
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:37,576
can drop the asset that should


357
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:38,696
be used in our right-to-left


358
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:39,146
language.


359
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:44,366
So I'll drop that in place and


360
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:46,036
build and run my app one last


361
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:50,226
time.


362
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:51,306
And there you have it.


363
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:52,996
With just a few small changes,


364
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,536
our app is now ready to support


365
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:54,976
right to left.


366
00:10:55,516 --> 00:11:01,396
[ Applause ]


367
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,076
So as you saw, with just a few


368
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,276
small changes to our app,


369
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:06,866
because the default templates


370
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,536
give us the support for free, we


371
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:09,956
can have an app that fully


372
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:10,916
supports a right-to-left


373
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,606
language, with very few changes


374
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,386
needed from us.


375
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,356
We also have a really powerful


376
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:16,366
tool in the right-to-left


377
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:17,626
pseudolanguage, that allows us


378
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,036
to simulate the effects of a


379
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,566
right-to-left layout without


380
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,806
having to read a right-to-left


381
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,286
language.


382
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,116
Now, one last note, if you're


383
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:26,356
using custom views in your


384
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:28,746
application, we have a system of


385
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,336
constraints in auto layout


386
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:32,076
engine that is a really powerful


387
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:34,496
tool to take care of layout for


388
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:35,606
right to left languages.


389
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,066
We also have an API effective


390
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,346
layout direction, which will


391
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:40,686
return to you if you are in a


392
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,186
left-to-right or a right-to-left


393
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:43,446
layout direction at run time,


394
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:45,396
which is really useful for doing


395
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,986
things like frame math in an


396
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:47,486
animation.


397
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:50,086
For more in-depth coverage about


398
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,016
all the things, and nuances for


399
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:52,926
supporting right-to-left


400
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:54,316
languages, I recommend checking


401
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:55,436
out last year's talks,


402
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,826
Internationalization Best


403
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:58,396
Practices, and What's New In


404
00:11:58,396 --> 00:11:59,846
International User Interfaces.


405
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:03,756
I can't wait to see your apps


406
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,706
supporting right-to-left


407
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,186
languages later this fall.


408
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:07,746
Now, here is Parry, with


409
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:08,826
template optimizations.


410
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:09,386
Thank you.


411
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,546
[ Applause ]


412
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,896
>> Thank you, Trevor.


413
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,406
Hi! I'm Parry.


414
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:17,676
I'm going to walk you through


415
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:18,996
some of the enhancements we made


416
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:20,496
to our templates that is going


417
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:21,656
to improve the performance of


418
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,346
your app, both in terms of time


419
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:23,936
and memory.


420
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,426
If you worked with TVMLKit apps


421
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,166
before, you might have noticed


422
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,656
that the performance of a


423
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:31,676
template degrades as you try to


424
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,406
add more content into it.


425
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,396
Let me illustrate with an


426
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:34,816
example.


427
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:37,756
So I'm working with Trevor on


428
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,246
our sample WWDC app, and I'm


429
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:43,066
trying to enhance it to add all


430
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,156
the sessions from the past,


431
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,236
instead of just the last year's


432
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:45,586
sessions.


433
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,506
We are keeping a simple design


434
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:50,036
with a grid to showcase all the


435
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:50,606
sessions.


436
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:52,606
Each session being represented


437
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,686
by a lockup composed of an image


438
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:56,426
and a title.


439
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,716
Now, you can imagine that there


440
00:12:58,716 --> 00:12:59,806
are thousands of these sessions


441
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:00,506
to show.


442
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,426
So in a typical scenario like


443
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:03,986
this, you don't want to show all


444
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:05,596
your content up front, because


445
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,026
A, it is going to take a long


446
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:09,196
time to load, and B, it might


447
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:10,606
not even be possible, because


448
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:11,876
your servers might not support


449
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:12,316
that.


450
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,846
But instead, you paginate your


451
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:15,396
data.


452
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:17,036
You start off with something


453
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,856
small, let's say about 500


454
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,626
items, and then you keep adding


455
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:22,516
to it, as the users scroll


456
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:23,826
through the end of your content.


457
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:26,916
Now, we did a bit of performance


458
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,586
analysis for such a scenario,


459
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,076
and this is what it looks like.


460
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,766
What you see in this graph is


461
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,866
the time it took to build the


462
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:36,996
template with a certain number


463
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:40,786
of items, and what you see on


464
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,056
the x axis is the number of


465
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,736
items in the template, and what


466
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,126
you see on the y is the time it


467
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:45,796
took to reach there.


468
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,346
And as you can see, it's an


469
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:49,426
exponential curve.


470
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,926
Meaning that it takes longer to


471
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,586
add the same number of items to


472
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:55,526
the template as the size of the


473
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:56,306
template grows.


474
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:58,726
But why is that?


475
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:01,236
Well, one of the major factors


476
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:02,876
is the size of the document


477
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,426
object model back in these


478
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:04,936
templates.


479
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,786
The problem is two-fold.


480
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:08,946
On one hand, you have the


481
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:09,786
parsing overhead.


482
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:11,816
First, in your JavaScript, when


483
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,076
you parse your data into the


484
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:15,016
DOM, so when the DOM size


485
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,376
increases it takes longer to add


486
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:18,356
more stuff to it, and then when


487
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,486
TVMLKit has to parse a DOM in


488
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,616
order to calculate out


489
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:24,156
information, like cell sizes,


490
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,156
line spacing, even scrolling


491
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:26,616
offsets.


492
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:28,316
All the things that make your


493
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:29,976
TVMLKit app look beautiful.


494
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,096
But as you can imagine, as the


495
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,966
size of the DOM increases, it


496
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:35,346
takes longer to perform these


497
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:35,826
operations.


498
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,886
And on the other hand, you have


499
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,626
an increasing memory pressure


500
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:42,926
because of an increasing DOM


501
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:44,656
size, which slows down your app


502
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:44,976
as a whole.


503
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,506
So to solve these problems, in


504
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,386
tvOS 11, we've come up with a


505
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,296
brand new paradigm of defining


506
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:56,446
templates using prototype and


507
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:59,396
data binding which is going to


508
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:00,976
significantly reduce the size of


509
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,786
your DOM, hence improving your


510
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,526
app's performance, and on top of


511
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:07,386
that, we've added APIs to


512
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:08,336
support pagination.


513
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:10,246
Let's look at these in more


514
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:10,586
detail.


515
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,996
In order to understand what a


516
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,786
prototype is, I'm going to walk


517
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:17,486
you through a typical template


518
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,336
building process.


519
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,296
You start off with the data from


520
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:22,776
your servers, and an empty shell


521
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:23,336
of a template.


522
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:24,456
In our case, it's a grid.


523
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,086
And in your JavaScript, you go


524
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:27,886
through each one of these


525
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,936
objects, and you can word them


526
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:32,446
into their corresponding TVML


527
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:33,096
markup.


528
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:35,056
In our case, it's a lockup.


529
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:37,866
Once you've done that, you parse


530
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:40,736
that into a DOM, and that is


531
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:42,296
when TVMLKit starts producing


532
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:43,386
the user interface for it.


533
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:46,286
But if you look closely, you'll


534
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:47,826
see that all of these lockups,


535
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,016
they look very similar.


536
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,736
In fact, the only thing that is


537
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,856
different between them are the


538
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:53,846
values that are coming from the


539
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:53,976
data.


540
00:15:56,796 --> 00:15:58,606
Once you remove these values,


541
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:00,806
what you end up with is an


542
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,756
identical looking lockup that


543
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:05,326
has all the information that


544
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:07,386
TVMLKit needs to compute that


545
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:08,306
layout up front.


546
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:10,856
So it turns out, you don't need


547
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,706
all of these lockups, you just


548
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,146
need one of them.


549
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:15,896
And that's what we call a


550
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:16,586
prototype.


551
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:20,306
So a prototype is a TVML schema


552
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:22,386
for your data objects that


553
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:24,196
TVMLKit can use to compute the


554
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,636
layout up front, and then at


555
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,116
runtime, it can combine it with


556
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:30,786
the data to author the DOM for


557
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:32,266
you, but only the parts that it


558
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,056
needs when it needs it.


559
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,616
So the DOM size remains concise,


560
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:38,176
and independent of your data set


561
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:38,476
size.


562
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:42,836
Now, you can imagine a template


563
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,166
with just a prototype would be


564
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,776
incomplete, because you also


565
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:46,546
need to provide data.


566
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:49,036
But on top of that, you also


567
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:51,146
need to provide a link between


568
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,936
your template and your data.


569
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:54,826
This is how TVMLKit can make


570
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:56,756
sense of what your data is, and


571
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,016
complete the template for you.


572
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:01,736
And you specify that using data


573
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:02,176
bindings.


574
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:05,976
There are three ways that you


575
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,746
can bind data to your templates


576
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:09,116
in tvOS 11.


577
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:12,546
First, you can bind a source and


578
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,806
attribute of an element.


579
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,425
In this example, the source


580
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:17,286
attribute of the image element,


581
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:18,776
which is bound to the URL


582
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:19,646
property of the data.


583
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:22,665
You can also bind text content


584
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:23,955
of an element, like in this


585
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,856
case, binding the text content


586
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,046
of the title element, with the


587
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,526
title property in the data.


588
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:33,106
And finally, you can bind items


589
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:35,966
of a section using the items


590
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:36,346
binding.


591
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,906
With this, you can bind the


592
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:40,156
trial DOM elements of the


593
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:41,356
section with an array of


594
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:41,986
objects.


595
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,786
So in a nutshell, data binding


596
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:47,886
provides the association between


597
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:48,656
a TVML property and a data


598
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:48,896
property.


599
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:49,796
And you can intuitively specify


600
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:50,606
it directly in TVML using a


601
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,086
binding attribute.


602
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:51,896
Now, when it comes to providing


603
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:52,796
data to TVMLKit, you can do that


604
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:53,666
in your JavaScript using a new


605
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:54,476
property you've introduced on a


606
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,286
DOM element called Data Item.


607
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:55,856
Here is an example.


608
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:56,516
You parse your JSON into


609
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:57,296
JavaScript Objects, then you


610
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,166
attach it to the section element


611
00:17:58,196 --> 00:17:58,976
using the data item property.


612
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,996
Now, let's move on to


613
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:03,656
pagination.


614
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:06,046
In tvOS 11 we have introduced a


615
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,386
new event called Needs More that


616
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:09,986
you can use to conveniently


617
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:10,986
implement pagination.


618
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:13,666
This event gets invoked as the


619
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:15,586
users scroll toward the end of


620
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:18,886
your content, and you get it on


621
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,676
list, shelf, grid, and even


622
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:28,416
stack template, so it's very


623
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:32,266
versatile, and you can use it in


624
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,086
almost any template.


625
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:35,416
However, if you're using


626
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,696
pagination on a data bound


627
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:40,676
template, you need to create


628
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:41,946
observable objects for your


629
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:42,766
data.


630
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,436
This is how TVMLKit can observe


631
00:18:45,616 --> 00:18:47,176
the changes that you make in the


632
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,556
data, and push those updates to


633
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,916
the user interface.


634
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:54,286
Let's take an example of how to


635
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,976
create these observable objects.


636
00:18:57,976 --> 00:19:00,006
So you start off just the same.


637
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:04,216
You parse your JSON into


638
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:08,756
JavaScript objects, but then you


639
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:11,176
go through each one of these


640
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:17,486
objects and map them into a data


641
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:19,176
item class.


642
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:22,406
This is something that they've


643
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:25,416
also introduced in tvOS 11 that


644
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,046
has an observer pattern built


645
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:27,366
in.


646
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:30,096
You construct the data item


647
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:31,686
class with an optional type, in


648
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:32,876
case you want to have multiple


649
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,166
prototypes in your template, and


650
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,326
a required identifier that


651
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:39,936
TVMLKit uses to push those


652
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:41,906
updates to the user interface


653
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:42,516
efficiently.


654
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:45,566
And once you have all of these


655
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:47,156
objects mapped, you want to wrap


656
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:48,596
them up in another data item,


657
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:51,946
and that is what you attach to


658
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:53,366
the element.


659
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:57,546
Let's take an example of how to


660
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:58,516
handle Needs More.


661
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:01,226
Now, Needs More is just like any


662
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:01,976
other event.


663
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:03,806
So you listen for it by using


664
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,776
the Add Event Listener method on


665
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,846
a DOM element, and you provide a


666
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:10,516
function that would have kind of


667
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:11,976
a similar implementation to what


668
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:13,576
you would have when creating the


669
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:13,986
template.


670
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,216
So you fetch the data from your


671
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,296
servers, map those objects into


672
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:21,376
data item, but finally, instead


673
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:23,066
of attaching those data items


674
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,156
directly to the element, you


675
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,006
append to the existing elements.


676
00:20:26,746 --> 00:20:28,266
And once you've done that, you


677
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,196
call Touch Property Path Method


678
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:32,216
on the data item class to push


679
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,466
your updates to the user


680
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:33,956
interface.


681
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:37,036
Now, let's put all of these


682
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:42,096
pieces together in a demo.


683
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:44,166
So as Trevor was doing his demo,


684
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,366
I actually went in and


685
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,376
implemented pagination in the


686
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:47,966
sample app.


687
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:49,896
So why don't we start from


688
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:50,076
there?


689
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:53,836
So I am going to take you


690
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,076
directly to the part where I


691
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:56,846
construct the stack document,


692
00:20:57,786 --> 00:20:59,816
and the event I'm handling is


693
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:01,536
directly on the stack element


694
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:01,986
itself.


695
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,266
And as you can see, what I'm


696
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,736
doing is fetching the next batch


697
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:06,996
of assets that I want to push in


698
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:08,906
the template, creating


699
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,696
JavaScript objects from the JSON


700
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:12,156
that is returned, and then


701
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:15,226
recalling populateGrid to add it


702
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:15,966
to the template.


703
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:17,666
Let's see what populateGrid


704
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:17,946
does.


705
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:21,746
Now, at this point, I haven't


706
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:23,356
converted my templates using


707
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,666
prototype and data binding.


708
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,836
So what you see here is very


709
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:26,386
familiar.


710
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:28,246
You would probably already know


711
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,116
what is happening here.


712
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:34,586
I start off with an empty grid


713
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:37,056
and I map all of my objects into


714
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:38,976
the corresponding TVML markup,


715
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,666
which is a lockup in this case,


716
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,486
and finally I parse all of those


717
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:44,926
lockups directly into the DOM.


718
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:47,386
Now, before I go ahead and


719
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:49,796
convert it into a data bound


720
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:51,506
template, let's run this app,


721
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,696
just to get a feel of what


722
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:53,746
pagination looks like in


723
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:54,336
TVMLKit.


724
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:03,066
So as you can see, it starts off


725
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:03,796
just the same.


726
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,856
But notice as I scroll toward


727
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:08,826
the end of this grid, the index


728
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,086
bar on the right side jumps


729
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:12,506
back, and that is because we are


730
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:14,146
adding all those items as we


731
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:15,276
approach toward the end.


732
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:17,706
So great, our pagination works.


733
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,596
But let's go back and complete


734
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,866
this example by converting our


735
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,646
templates to using prototype and


736
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:25,256
data binding.


737
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:30,946
Now, as you might have imagined,


738
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,346
all the changes that I need to


739
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:34,706
make in order to convert it into


740
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:36,346
a data bound template are in


741
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:38,486
this one function, populateGrid.


742
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:40,626
And the first thing I want to do


743
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:44,566
is, instead of adding a simple


744
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:47,336
grid, I want to add prototypes


745
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,936
and a bound grid, like this.


746
00:22:54,196 --> 00:22:56,076
The next thing I want to do is,


747
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:57,926
instead of mapping all of these


748
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,436
objects into their markup, I


749
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:04,216
want to map them into observable


750
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,746
objects using data item class.


751
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:12,056
Just like that.


752
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:15,796
And finally, instead of creating


753
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:19,136
all of these markups into the


754
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,636
DOM itself, I want to append my


755
00:23:21,636 --> 00:23:23,606
created data items into the


756
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:26,726
existing ones.


757
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:32,486
Like so. So now that we have all


758
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,166
of these pieces in, let's re-run


759
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:34,976
this app and check it out.


760
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,426
Now, right out of the box, one


761
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:46,416
thing that I have noticed is


762
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,936
that it loads faster, even with


763
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:49,746
such a small subset of content


764
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:51,506
that I'm loading up front, it


765
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:52,696
takes less time to load.


766
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:54,446
And as I scroll toward the


767
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,316
bottom, it has flawless


768
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:00,056
performance with buttery smooth


769
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:00,496
scrolling.


770
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:03,006
It is quite addictive, I could


771
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,106
scroll all day actually.


772
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:12,016
[ Applause ]


773
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,766
So let's do a quick recap of


774
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:15,356
what you saw.


775
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:20,446
What you saw is how to implement


776
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:22,456
your templates using a better


777
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:25,046
paradigm of prototypes and data


778
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:25,486
binding.


779
00:24:26,496 --> 00:24:27,926
That is going to reduce your DOM


780
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,076
size, and make your apps


781
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,106
perform, and how to implement


782
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,766
pagination conveniently using


783
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:34,506
Needs More event.


784
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:37,166
Now, there is one more thing


785
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,986
that I want to recreate before I


786
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:39,216
go.


787
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:41,516
Remember this graph that I


788
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:43,086
showed you earlier, about how


789
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:44,276
long it takes to build a


790
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,536
template to a certain number of


791
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:45,866
items?


792
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,606
After re-implementing our


793
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:50,626
example with prototypes and data


794
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:52,676
binding, we re-ran this test,


795
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:55,956
and we found there were more


796
00:24:55,956 --> 00:24:58,406
than 50% reduction in the time


797
00:24:58,406 --> 00:24:59,426
it took to build these


798
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:00,036
templates.


799
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:01,816
So we were really happy with it.


800
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:04,706
So I encourage you to check out


801
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,446
these APIs, and try them out in


802
00:25:06,446 --> 00:25:08,596
your apps, and see what you can


803
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:09,296
gain from them.


804
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:10,986
I am going to hand it over to


805
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:12,396

[ Applause ]


809
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:21,666
>> Thank you Parry.


810
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,366
Hi everyone, my name is Jeremy.


811
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:24,866
And today I am here to tell you


812
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:26,276
how you can achieve happiness


813
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:28,336
when you do TVMLKit development


814
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:30,676
with the help of Web Inspector.


815
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:34,306
Now, we have seen amazing demos


816
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:36,126
from Parry and Trevor, trying to


817
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:38,066
build up a simple WWDC app.


818
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,986
And at this point in time, it is


819
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:40,786
fairly capable.


820
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:43,236
It supports RTL, so it can be


821
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:44,466
localized immediately to


822
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:46,396
right-to-left languages.


823
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:48,176
And it uses data binding and


824
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:49,266
prototypes, so you could scroll


825
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,976
forever, and not stop.


826
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:56,406
Now, as luck would have it, just


827
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:57,456
a few days before we are ready


828
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,406
to ship, the designer comes over


829
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:00,926
and hands us this mock-up.


830
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:02,466
He gives you a thumbs up and


831
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,916
says, "this should be easy to


832
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:04,366
fix."


833
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,716
Now, we all know that is not


834
00:26:06,716 --> 00:26:07,206
true.


835
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:08,946
And I empathize with that, and I


836
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,516
can hear all the inward groaning


837
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:12,056
in all your bellies.


838
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:14,516
So let's try to articulate this


839
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:16,336
feeling that we have by looking


840
00:26:16,336 --> 00:26:17,346
at the development cycle,


841
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:18,576
especially when it comes to


842
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,786
updating user interface.


843
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,916
The very first thing you have to


844
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,066
do is that you have to formulate


845
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,176
speculative fixes, guess well as


846
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,996
to what it involves to fix the


847
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:28,236
UI.


848
00:26:28,826 --> 00:26:30,016
Is the margin one pixel to the


849
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,036
right, or to the left?


850
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,346
Once you have formulated all


851
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:35,106
your fixes, you have to go


852
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:36,436
through this tedious Build and


853
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:37,156
Run cycle.


854
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:38,626
You build and run in X code,


855
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:40,656
wait for the app to start, look


856
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:42,036
at the changes, is this right or


857
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:42,326
not?


858
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:43,576
And if it is wrong, you go


859
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,136
through that over and over again


860
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:45,926
until it is right.


861
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,956
Consequently, because of that,


862
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,076
there is a huge loss of context.


863
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:52,866
You forgot where you were and


864
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:53,626
what you're trying to fix,


865
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:55,016
simply because there is this


866
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:56,506
huge time gap between the


867
00:26:56,506 --> 00:26:57,906
changes you make, and seeing


868
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:58,546
them on the screen.


869
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:02,006
So how amazing would it be if


870
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:02,966
there was something that could


871
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,806
help us fix all these problems?


872
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,056
Seasoned web developers out


873
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:08,686
there already use Web Inspector,


874
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,206
with all these amazing features.


875
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,986
It is about visual debugging,


876
00:27:12,486 --> 00:27:13,546
local and session storage


877
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:15,056
introspection, even performance


878
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:16,306
analysis for JavaScript.


879
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:20,156
And today, tvOS only supports


880
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,596
this small subset of features in


881
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:24,126
TVMLKit for Web Inspector.


882
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,746
So today I am really pleased to


883
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,186
announce that in tvOS 11 we are


884
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:30,646
adding support for the remaining


885
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:32,116
few bits of Web Inspector.


886
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:36,556
[ Applause ]


887
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,356
>> So to get us started, let's


888
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,396
talk about visual debugging.


889
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:42,656
Your TVML app is a document that


890
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:44,816
is represented as a DOM, and to


891
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:46,156
visualize that, Web Inspector


892
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:47,466
has the Elements tab.


893
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,616
It shows a tree of all the nodes


894
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:51,936
that TVML uses to render UI on


895
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,846
the screen.


896
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:54,786
So the very first thing we did


897
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:56,906
is we wanted to eliminate all


898
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:58,256
guesswork as to the things you


899
00:27:58,256 --> 00:27:59,756
actually have to fix, and that


900
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:00,936
is through the usage of


901
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:01,756
visualization.


902
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,536
If you move your mouse slowly


903
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,576
over the nodes in your tree, we


904
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,456
would highlight the


905
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:07,586
corresponding views on the


906
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,286
screen itself.


907
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:09,756
We even give you information


908
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,756
about its dimensions, and its


909
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,116
elements that it is associated


910
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:14,956
with.


911
00:28:14,956 --> 00:28:16,966
So now that you know the exact


912
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,326
node you have to fix, you can


913
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:19,966
edit the individual XML


914
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,836
structure of that node itself.


915
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:23,646
Any changes you make will


916
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:25,616
validate before rendering UI for


917
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:25,716
it.


918
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:27,926
Now, if you don't want to deal


919
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:29,126
with XML, and you just want to


920
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,886
reorder nodes on the screen, you


921
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:31,886
can also do that.


922
00:28:32,196 --> 00:28:33,826
It is as simple as dragging the


923
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:35,206
nodes between the areas that you


924
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:36,756
want it to go and then the


925
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,756
screen updates itself.


926
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,916
For developers that want to see


927
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,036
their applications in a


928
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:43,746
different light, light or dark,


929
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,376
you can change the attributes on


930
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:46,076
the template itself.


931
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:47,336
In fact, you can change any


932
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:49,106
attributes on any nodes you


933
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:49,366
want.


934
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:51,626
And finally, all these changes


935
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,246
that you have made, you are able


936
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:55,116
to copy it out and paste it in


937
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,056
any file you want.


938
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:58,646
Now that we've seen how we can


939
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:00,136
change the layout itself, let's


940
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:01,696
look at the properties we use to


941
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:02,906
render UI on the screen.


942
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,026
Web Inspector allows you now to


943
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,266
look at the individual rules


944
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:08,446
that are attached to individual


945
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,856
nodes, so you can see every


946
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:11,586
single rule that is used to


947
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,826
render them on the screen.


948
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:15,986
These are arranged in a cascade


949
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,326
ordering, rules that matter the


950
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:18,916
most are right at the top, and


951
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,136
things that it overrides is


952
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:22,586
loaded right at the bottom.


953
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,446
Media queries are able to be


954
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:25,736
visualized as well, so you'll be


955
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:27,466
able to see the individual rules


956
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:28,926
that correspond to specific


957
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:30,596
media queries, so for example,


958
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,906
you have rules for LTR, you will


959
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,246
be able to see them grouped that


960
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:35,446
way too.


961
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:37,696
Finally, the Web Inspector


962
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:38,866
allows you to look at the


963
00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:40,336
default rules that ship with the


964
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:41,376
framework itself, so that


965
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,106
totally takes guesswork out of


966
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:44,286
figuring out what is the default


967
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:46,126
rules that you have to change in


968
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:47,566
order to make your UI look like


969
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:50,216
the beauty it is.


970
00:29:50,216 --> 00:29:51,576
And of course, with all these


971
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:53,576
rules that are displayed, we


972
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:55,476
will also show you the coalesced


973
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:56,506
version of it.


974
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:57,886
These are the exact styles that


975
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:59,246
the framework uses to render UI


976
00:29:59,246 --> 00:29:59,886
on the screen.


977
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:04,106
In Web Inspector, there is a


978
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:05,686
reload button, and now, by


979
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:06,666
hitting the reload button, you


980
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,326
are able to restart the entire


981
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:10,036
JavaScript context without going


982
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:11,336
through Build and Run over and


983
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:11,916
over again.


984
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:13,696
So with that, I'd love to show


985
00:30:13,696 --> 00:30:15,776
you a demo of all these features


986
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:16,526
that I've talked about.


987
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:23,496
So I have gone ahead and gotten


988
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:25,316
the project ready, and updated


989
00:30:25,316 --> 00:30:27,016
the UI, but the last bit to do


990
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:28,326
is to check if it accurately


991
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:28,856
supports RTL.


992
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:29,236
There we go.


993
00:30:29,236 --> 00:30:35,126
And once again, we are going to


994
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,496
use the thing that Trevor taught


995
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:37,966
us, by going to the scheme, and


996
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:39,566
changing the system language to


997
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:40,876
right-to-left pseudolanguage.


998
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:42,976
Let's build and run.


999
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:55,216
All right.


1000
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:57,006
As we can see, everything looks


1001
00:30:57,076 --> 00:30:58,396
kind of right, except the banner


1002
00:30:58,396 --> 00:30:59,826
right up there, which we haven't


1003
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:01,106
optimized for RTL.


1004
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:02,896
So instead of going through that


1005
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:04,276
Build and Run cycle that Trevor


1006
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,866
was doing, let's try to do it in


1007
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:06,536
Web Inspector.


1008
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,136
The way to do this is that you


1009
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:11,666
start Safari, there is a develop


1010
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,016
menu that I've already enabled,


1011
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:14,576
and you go into Simulator, and


1012
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:16,756
inspect the app that you want to


1013
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:17,796
look at.


1014
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:23,026
So Web Inspector starts up, and


1015
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:23,916
let's get going.


1016
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,946
So we want to change specific


1017
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:28,116
user interface elements on the


1018
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:29,506
screen, and we can see that the


1019
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:30,646
title, the subtitle, and the


1020
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:31,676
button needs some work.


1021
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:33,636
With Web Inspector, you can


1022
00:31:33,636 --> 00:31:35,236
easily drill down to the exact


1023
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:37,006
nodes that it is related to by


1024
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:37,976
moving the mouse, and you can


1025
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,076
see that things start getting


1026
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:39,646
highlighted.


1027
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:41,626
So let's go quickly to the title


1028
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:41,976
and change it.


1029
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,706
Now, Web Inspector shows you all


1030
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:47,876
the rules that correspond to


1031
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,506
this node, and all we need to do


1032
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:51,396
is hunt for this pesky bottom


1033
00:31:51,396 --> 00:31:52,436
left that should be actually


1034
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:53,186
bottom viewing.


1035
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:55,656
And as I type, observe what


1036
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,126
happens on the simulator screen


1037
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:57,526
itself.


1038
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,206
Boom, it updates automatically


1039
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:03,336
without needing to build and


1040
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:03,556
run.


1041
00:32:03,556 --> 00:32:05,946
So it's so quick, so for those


1042
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:07,376
that missed it, let's try to do


1043
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,406
it again for the subtitle


1044
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:10,256
itself, and it's the same steps.


1045
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,426
Locate the element you want, and


1046
00:32:12,426 --> 00:32:14,066
change the style associated with


1047
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:14,346
it.


1048
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:16,896
There we go.


1049
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:19,466
Now, let's quickly update the


1050
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:20,536
Play button as well, so it's on


1051
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:21,676
the right side of the screen.


1052
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:24,916
For that, we are going to change


1053
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,166
all right to trailing.


1054
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:34,026
Trailing. And of course, like


1055
00:32:34,026 --> 00:32:35,526
Trevor did as well, we need a


1056
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:36,636
special media created for its


1057
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:38,676
margins, because it is different


1058
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:40,106
when in RTL language.


1059
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:41,666
So I am going to copy margin


1060
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:41,886
here.


1061
00:32:43,096 --> 00:32:43,846
Paste it over.


1062
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:46,246
And change all that.


1063
00:32:46,786 --> 00:32:47,806
And there we have it.


1064
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,786
Now, since all these changes


1065
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:51,176
were made to the author style


1066
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,596
sheet itself, which is contained


1067
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,876
in the style attribute, the


1068
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,376
style tag, we are going to copy


1069
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:57,016
this out.


1070
00:32:58,216 --> 00:32:59,456
In order to verify, we are going


1071
00:32:59,456 --> 00:33:00,786
to paste it into our TVML


1072
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:01,286
document.


1073
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:05,046
So here we go.


1074
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:08,626
And then instead of building and


1075
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:10,966
run, we're just going to hit


1076
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:11,396
Reload.


1077
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:12,896
And there we have it.


1078
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,416
Everything works correctly


1079
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:14,886
[applause].


1080
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:16,296
Let's go back to the slides.


1081
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,776
[ Applause ]


1082
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:21,496
So what we are seeing is a very


1083
00:33:21,496 --> 00:33:22,926
quick way to figure out user


1084
00:33:22,926 --> 00:33:24,286
interface issues and fix them.


1085
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:26,266
What we've done is we have


1086
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:27,776
looked for the particular nodes


1087
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:29,916
that it has affected, edited


1088
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:31,486
them in real time, and finally,


1089
00:33:31,486 --> 00:33:32,936
verification is just done by


1090
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,276
copying the TVML properties out


1091
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,706
and restarting your JavaScript


1092
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:38,706
context without doing build and


1093
00:33:38,706 --> 00:33:39,896
run over and over again.


1094
00:33:40,946 --> 00:33:42,406
So that is the visual debugging.


1095
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:43,916
I would like to now move on to


1096
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:44,936
network analysis.


1097
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:47,526
Web Inspector now supports


1098
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,336
looking at all network requests


1099
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:50,686
that are sent from TVMLKit


1100
00:33:50,686 --> 00:33:51,306
application.


1101
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,846
We will show you individual


1102
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:55,026
request timing information.


1103
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:56,996
So how long a DNS query takes.


1104
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:58,396
How long a response takes to get


1105
00:33:58,396 --> 00:33:59,436
sent over the wire.


1106
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,846
You will inspect the individual


1107
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:03,246
request properties that you set


1108
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:04,626
on your request, so you can


1109
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,336
verify if these are the exact


1110
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,326
things we are sending out.


1111
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:09,556
And finally, response and


1112
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:11,206
request headers is something you


1113
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:13,996
can look at as well.


1114
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:15,275
You may have scripts already


1115
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:17,505
today that you use to develop


1116
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:18,806
local and session storage.


1117
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:20,286
There is no need to do that


1118
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:21,426
anymore, because Web Inspector


1119
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,126
provides a nice user interface


1120
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:24,696
to look at every single key


1121
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,815
value pass that is in your local


1122
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,936
and session storage, and because


1123
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,456
you can look at them, it also


1124
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:31,766
means you can modify them.


1125
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:33,775
So you can copy them, delete,


1126
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:34,766
and move them around.


1127
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:38,516
With that, that is TVMLKit and


1128
00:34:38,516 --> 00:34:39,985
Web Inspector support, and that


1129
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:40,966
is also how you achieve


1130
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:41,606
happiness.


1131
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:45,545
[ Applause ]


1132
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:47,045
So what we've seen today,


1133
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:49,666
TVMLKit supports RTL right out


1134
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:50,806
of the box for all default


1135
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:51,356
templates.


1136
00:34:51,476 --> 00:34:52,616
It is a little bit of work if


1137
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,436
you have custom styles, but it


1138
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:55,295
is easy to do.


1139
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,326
Use data binding and prototypes


1140
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:58,286
if you want buttery smooth


1141
00:34:58,286 --> 00:35:00,606
scrolling, like Parry has said,


1142
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,906
and finally, use Web Inspector


1143
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,426
if you want to reduce the amount


1144
00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:05,876
of development time it takes to


1145
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:06,456
fix bugs.


1146
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,386

We have sample code and


1149
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:11,646
documentation that you should


1150
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:12,606
really look at.


1151
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:15,026
There are amazing sessions, as


1152
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:16,686
well, especially What's New in


1153
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,116
tvOS tomorrow.


1154
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:21,486
Thank you for attending WWDC 17,


1155
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,456
and have a great rest of the


1156
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:22,946
conference.
