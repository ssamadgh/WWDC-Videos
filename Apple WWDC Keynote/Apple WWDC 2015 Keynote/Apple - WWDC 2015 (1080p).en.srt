00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:21,058
TIM COOK:
Good morning!

2
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,294
Good morning!

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,860
Good morning.

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,727
Good morning.

5
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,431
Good morning!

6
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:35,871
Thanks for joining us.

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,539
And welcome to San Francisco.

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,537
Welcome to WWDC 2015.

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,611
Although we may not
have any -- thank you --

10
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,411
high-flying trapeze acts, we
do have a lot of great things

11
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,415
to talk about this morning.

12
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,757
This developer conference
continues to be the epicenter

13
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:58,824
of change for not only
Apple, but the industry.

14
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,195
This is our 26th WWDC.

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,795
We have attendees today
from over 70 countries,

16
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,369
and 80 percent are here
for the very first time.

17
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:14,909
[Applause]

18
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:19,148
This is our most
global conference ever.

19
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:24,386
And a special shout-out for
our 350 scholarship winners.

20
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:31,854
[Cheers and applause]

21
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,828
These guys are unbelievable.

22
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,427
I spent some time
with them yesterday.

23
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,299
Our youngest scholarship
winner is a 12-year-old girl

24
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,439
from New York.

25
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,904
She is going to have a
fantastic future ahead.

26
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,904
[Applause]

27
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,406
We've got over a hundred
sessions planned for you

28
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,408
and over 150 labs so that
you can get your hands

29
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,051
on our latest technologies.

30
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,617
And we've got over a thousand
Apple engineers to answer just

31
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,717
about any question
that you might have.

32
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,591
Now, we've got a lot more
people that would have liked

33
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,889
to have been here this
morning, but unfortunately,

34
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,791
we just can't fit any
more in, as you can tell.

35
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,695
And so for the first time,

36
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,467
we're not only live
streaming the Keynote,

37
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,867
but we are live streaming
30 sessions

38
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,439
of the conference as well.

39
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:24,308
[Applause]

40
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,651
Now, before we get right to
the show, I'd like to bring

41
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,417
up something that I saw on
the news just a few days ago.

42
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,718
This is Brandon Moss of
the Cleveland Indians,

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,690
and he hit his 100th career
home run last Tuesday.

44
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,832
Obviously, it's a huge milestone
if you are a baseball player.

45
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,097
Not a lot of people do this.

46
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,096
And you can imagine how much

47
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,238
that ball would mean
to him to have it.

48
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:52,605
It turns out the ball was hit
into the Indians' bull pen,

49
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:57,046
and his teammates decided to
play a bit of a prank on him.

50
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:01,014
They decided to hold
it for ransom.

51
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,784
And this is the list of
things they asked for.

52
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:10,295
[Laughter] Apple Watches,
iPads, MacBook Airs, iPhones.

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,360
It's unbelievable.

54
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,498
It's a shopping list
for the Apple Store.

55
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:19,633
[Applause]

56
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,603
Now, Brandon would have
had to raid an Apple Store

57
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,202
to get that ball back.

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,074
That didn't seem quite right
to us, and so what we're going

59
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,345
to do is we're going
to pay the ransom.

60
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:37,514
And I have the ball right here.

61
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:45,527
[Applause]

62
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,295
We are giving the ball to
Brandon, and we are going

63
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,666
to give everything his
teammates asked for to them

64
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,536
so everybody is happy.

65
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,604
So congratulations, Brandon,
on a hundred home runs,

66
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,544
and good luck on
the next hundred.

67
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:04,779
[Applause]

68
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,318
Now, we've got a
jam-packed morning for you.

69
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,314
We are going to get
started with OS X.

70
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,986
We are bringing a whole bunch

71
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,284
of new great capabilities
to the Macintosh.

72
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,087
And next we've got a
great update for iOS,

73
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,491
the world's most advanced
mobile operating system.

74
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,795
And today we're bringing
native apps

75
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,569
to the Watch with a new version.

76
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:33,208
[Applause]

77
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,306
With a new version
of the watchOS,

78
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,279
which gives the developers
even more time

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,650
to create even greater
apps for the Watch

80
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,920
that will change the world.

81
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,589
Now, all three of these
ecosystems together provide

82
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,029
incredible opportunities
for developers

83
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,826
and unbelievable
possibilities for users.

84
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,830
So we are very excited
about this.

85
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,332
There's a lot here, and
so I am going to dispense

86
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,504
with my normal updates other

87
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,103
than to tell you
everything's going great.

88
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,106
[Laughter]

89
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:12,078
[Applause]

90
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,578
And I'd like to bring
out my friend

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,550
and colleague Craig Federighi to
take you through OS X and iOS.

92
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,221
Craig.

93
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,820
[Applause]

94
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,163
CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Good morning!

95
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,165
It's fantastic to be
with you here at WWDC.

96
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,267
The team has been doing
some amazing work this year,

97
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,440
and I am thrilled to be able
to share it with you today.

98
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,510
We are going to start with OS X.

99
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,080
Now, our current release,
Yosemite, is a big, bold,

100
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,650
beautiful release
with a gorgeous new UI

101
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,820
and breakthrough features like
Continuity that let you work

102
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,190
across your devices
like never before.

103
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,260
Now, the adoption rate for
Yosemite is just incredible.

104
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,001
In fact, over 55 percent

105
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,797
of active Mac users are
running our latest update,

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,240
and this is just unprecedented
in the history of our industry.

107
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:15,908
[Laughter] In fact, Yosemite
has the fastest adoption rate

108
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,249
for any PC operating
system ever.

109
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,675
So thank you.

110
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:26,149
[Applause]

111
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,852
So for our next big release of
OS X, we knew we wanted to build

112
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,156
on those strengths of Yosemite

113
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,358
with some really great
refinements and advances.

114
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:39,802
The only real question, of
course, was what to call it.

115
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:45,639
So we had to once again turn to
our crack Apple Marketing Team.

116
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,339
Now, in typical California
fashion, they started

117
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,212
with a project kickoff meeting.

118
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,011
[Laughter]

119
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,483
And then headed immediately
into a team building off site.

120
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,753
[Laughter]

121
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,252
Now, of course they are in their
traditional Apple Marketing

122
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,654
Free-Bottom Fridays attire.

123
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,657
They say it's all
part of their process.

124
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,759
I am not sure I get it.

125
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,161
Ultimately, this
didn't yield any names,

126
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,264
so they called in a consultant.

127
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,266
[Laughter]

128
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,638
He told them the answer
was to be found within.

129
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,639
Not within themselves,
but within Yosemite.

130
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:29,753
And so the new name for
OS X is OS X El Capitan.

131
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:38,829
[Applause]

132
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,766
For El Capitan, we focused
in two major areas --

133
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,301
experience and performance.

134
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,437
For experience, we've made
Spotlight more expressive,

135
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,805
more powerful, and more
knowledgeable than ever.

136
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,445
We've made big enhancements
to the apps you use most,

137
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,482
and we made some real great
advancements in the area

138
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,948
of how you manage
windows on the system.

139
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,887
But rather than just talk about
it, I'd like to show it to you,

140
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,783
so let's start with
a demo right now.

141
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:11,426
[Applause]

142
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,094
Now, your first task, of
course, in a demonstration

143
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:17,094
or whenever you wake your
Mac, is finding the cursor,

144
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,937
and El Capitan makes
this easier than ever.

145
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,832
I just do that little
shake we all normally do,

146
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,665
and there it is.

147
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,599
It comes right out to greet you.

148
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,803
It's really handy.

149
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,974
[Applause]

150
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,015
Now, we brought other great
gestures to the system.

151
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,210
I am just going to
go here in Mail.

152
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,412
I have a message here from Eddy.

153
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:38,284
Looks like -- well, now --
[Laughter] -- that's a keeper.

154
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,524
So I can actually mark
it unread to keep it just

155
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,361
by swiping two fingers across
the trackpad just like that.

156
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,428
And this one I'd kind of like
to delete, so I am just going

157
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,098
to swipe it away just like that.

158
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,136
So some real nice
little gestures.

159
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,272
Let's move on now to Safari.

160
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,307
Now, in Safari, I have some
sites that I like to keep

161
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,073
around because I refer to them
on and off throughout the day,

162
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:05,943
and now in Safari, I can pin
those sites just like this.

163
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,985
So there's -- I am going to
pin my Twitter site here.

164
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,282
And of course I have been
following the Warriors.

165
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,354
Go Warriors, we are
going to get it done.

166
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,353
[Applause]

167
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,555
Just like that.

168
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,096
Now, Pinned Sites have a
lot of special properties.

169
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,562
For one, if I close this
window and reopen it,

170
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,102
you see that my Pinned
Sites are all right there,

171
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,998
and they load instantly.

172
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,739
Now, Pinned Sites also behave
differently when I follow links,

173
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,306
so I am just going
to click on one here,

174
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,544
and you notice it opens in a new
tab, but my pinned site remains.

175
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,912
Now I am going to open
up a couple more links.

176
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,551
This one, let's see, this one.

177
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,047
I will take a quick look.

178
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,288
This one looks like some
kind of presentation video.

179
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,514
This one is about the Giants.

180
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,918
Have you ever had
this happen to you?

181
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,260
You are like, Where is
this audio coming from?

182
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,296
Now with just a tap,
you can mute it or find

183
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:58,894
out where it came from and
shut it down just like that.

184
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:03,768
[Applause]

185
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,870
So I am interested in
seeing this Giants game,

186
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,913
and now Spotlight can
actually help me out there.

187
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,748
So I am just going to do a
search for the SF Giants,

188
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,944
and we see right now I
get current game scores,

189
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,248
upcoming games.

190
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,519
Looks like the game I want
to go to is on Friday,

191
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,958
so I can just search
for weather on Friday.

192
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,285
See we get the weather.

193
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:28,799
We can even resize the Spotlight
panel and move it around.

194
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,895
I mean, there's innovation; huh?

195
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,739
[Laughter] But I can also
express myself in my own words

196
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,205
in Spotlight searches now, so
I can do things like slides

197
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,275
from Brian, and you
see I find those there.

198
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,274
But how about slides from
Brian about El Capitan?

199
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,718
You see, I find exactly what I
am looking for in my own words.

200
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,955
Now, this works great
in other apps as well.

201
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,590
Let's try it out in Mail.

202
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,425
So I've been really busy, of
course, the last couple of days,

203
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,191
so I have been getting a
little behind on my Mail.

204
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,390
I want to see the messages
that I've received from Phil

205
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,833
but that I haven't
responded to yet.

206
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:08,268
So I am just going to say
"mail I ignored from Phil."

207
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,669
[Laughter] There are a few,
but I will be getting back

208
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,111
to him right after the show.

209
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:19,708
[Laughter] So next, of course,
it's great in the Finder

210
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,052
as well, so if I wanted to look
at documents that I was working

211
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,589
on last year at this time,
I might say something like

212
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:31,856
"documents I worked
on last June."

213
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,628
And I find exactly
what I am looking for.

214
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,296
So this is really a
great way to search.

215
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,796
Next I want to turn to window
management, so I am just going

216
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,938
to run a script here that's
going to open up a whole bunch

217
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,434
of windows to simulate kind
of what my desktop looks

218
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,636
like after a day working on OS
X because it's a powerful system

219
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,209
and we tend to have
a lot of things open.

220
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,247
OS X provides some great ways
to navigate your windows,

221
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,585
and one of those
is Mission Control.

222
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,950
In El Capitan, we made
Mission Control smoother,

223
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,481
simpler, and faster than ever.

224
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,385
I am going to take three fingers
and swipe up on the trackpad.

225
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,128
We get this gorgeous
overview of Mission Control.

226
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,664
I'll just bring forward Safari.

227
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,259
Let's do that again
and bring up Mail.

228
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,062
Just like that.

229
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,263
Works really great.

230
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,404
Of course, OS X provides
great tools also

231
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,769
to organize your windows, and
one of those is Full Screen.

232
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,108
I am going to take this
window here full screen,

233
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,044
and I am going to reply.

234
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,779
Looks like there's a
message here from Eddy.

235
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,375
He says sorry about bailing
on the team dinner last night.

236
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,719
He was apparently
prepping for the Keynote.

237
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,146
So that's understandable.

238
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,220
But it looks like, actually,
I just got a new mail

239
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,021
from Jeff here, and now I can
just click away, and it hides,

240
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,895
and then -- oh, hold on.

241
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,294
Busted, Eddy.

242
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,336
So I think I'll just
drag this, actually,

243
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,571
right into my Compose window,
it hops up automatically,

244
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,698
and I can do it just like that.

245
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,072
It's really great.

246
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,180
And I can even open up
tabs in Compose as well.

247
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,545
It's really handy.

248
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:02,083
So this is a great way now to
work in full screen in Mail.

249
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:08,091
[Applause]

250
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,357
Thank you.

251
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,825
Now, we've done something
totally new to El Capitan,

252
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,193
and it's the ability
to work really easily

253
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,932
on two windows side by side.

254
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,067
So I am just going to click and
hold here on the green button.

255
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,764
And you see it's
prompting me to pick a side.

256
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,038
I will just drop it in.

257
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,036
And you notice I get an expose
of all my other windows.

258
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,108
Let me pick the new News
app, just like that.

259
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:33,977
[Applause]

260
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,950
Of course, I can
resize this window

261
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,488
to style it just the way I want.

262
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,423
How about that blur?

263
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,588
Again, innovation.

264
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,386
[Laughter] So, great
way to work.

265
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,129
Here I can drag links,
for instance,

266
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,764
from Safari right in here.

267
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,060
You notice in the new Notes app,
I get a beautiful graphical link

268
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,264
that gives me a nice thumbnail

269
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,535
that helps me identify
what I dragged in there.

270
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,735
I am going to drag
in some yurts.

271
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,178
I think yurts, first
time mentioned

272
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,373
on the WWDC Keynote stage.

273
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,545
There you go.

274
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,673
Got some yurts here.

275
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,577
Great way to work split screen.

276
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,651
We've also provided a really
easy way to move windows

277
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,251
into their own desktops.

278
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,652
So let me just take this window
here, I'm just going to drag it

279
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,495
up past the top of the screen,
and drop it in just like that.

280
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:23,162
So easy. I can also do this
to take a window full screen.

281
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,932
So let's take Photos, just
drop it in right here,

282
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,532
I took it full screen.

283
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,703
Check this out.

284
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,201
I am going to take
Messages, drop it on Photos,

285
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,875
and create a split
view just like that.

286
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,174
Totally awesome.

287
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,616
[Applause]

288
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,513
And that is a quick look
at some improvements

289
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:46,185
to the experience in El Capitan.

290
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:50,995
[Applause]

291
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,890
So we saw in El Capitan
a powerful form of search

292
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,733
in Spotlight that lets
you compose your searches

293
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,899
in your own words.

294
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,238
It knows more than ever,

295
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,403
can look up weather,
stocks, game scores.

296
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:09,413
We saw gestures, for instance,
just swiping to delete in Mail.

297
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,708
And, of course, pin
sites in Safari

298
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,881
and the ability to
easily mute tabs.

299
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,621
A great new Notes app that
supports text styling,

300
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,717
checklists, and graphical links.

301
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,690
And better window
management than ever

302
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,758
with a beautiful new
Mission Control interface,

303
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,959
easy access to your
spaces bar, and of course,

304
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,662
the ability to do split
view and adjust it

305
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,236
to see exactly what
you are looking for,

306
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,374
every pixel of your display
devoted to your content.

307
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,571
Of course, there's much more
to experience in El Capitan,

308
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:45,374
but now I want to
turn to performance.

309
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,618
So we've optimized performance
throughout the system.

310
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,515
In fact, we are seeing about
a 1.4 times acceleration

311
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,519
in app launching,
a 2x improvement

312
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,292
in the snappiness
of switching apps.

313
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,062
The time to get first Mail
messages, twice as fast.

314
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,262
Opening a PDF in preview,
four times as fast.

315
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,105
But we've also made deep
architectural improvements,

316
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,272
and that brings us to Metal.

317
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,172
[Applause]

318
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,315
Thank you.

319
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,050
Last year we introduced
Metal at WWDC as a way

320
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,686
to accelerate graphics in
high-performance games.

321
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,223
It takes the overhead
out of OpenGL,

322
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,119
providing a high-performance API

323
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,420
that gives the game
direct access to the power

324
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,423
of the underlying
graphics hardware.

325
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,025
Well, this year we are
bringing Metal to the Mac.

326
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,398
And we are doing more than that.

327
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,567
Because we are taking the
graphic stacks on which apps

328
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,467
on OS X are built, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,

329
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,910
and moving them from OpenGL to
run natively on top of Metal,

330
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,808
making everything you do faster.

331
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,150
We are seeing 50
percent improvements

332
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,485
in rendering performance
and a 40 percent reduction

333
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,122
in the amount of CPU
necessary to do graphics.

334
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,658
That means improved performance
for your applications

335
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,494
and better battery life.

336
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,789
But the benefits of
Metal don't stop there.

337
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,462
Metal's also great for
high-performance apps.

338
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:14,503
In fact, Metal combines
the compute power of OpenCL

339
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,970
and the graphics power of OpenGL

340
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:21,008
in a higher performance
API that does both.

341
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,337
And what we've seen from working

342
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:26,081
with early pro developers
is really phenomenal.

343
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,318
Adobe came in and,
in short order,

344
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:31,684
was able to deliver an
eight times improvement

345
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:35,054
in their rendering effects
inside of After Effects,

346
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,994
and they have been able
to take the drawing engine

347
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,590
in Illustrator, move it on top
of Metal, and take kinds of UI

348
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,794
that previously was
noninteractive,

349
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,697
like zoom of extremely
detailed drawings,

350
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,670
and make it completely flawless

351
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,269
and interactive,
thanks to Metal.

352
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,711
Adobe is so pleased with this
they said they are committed

353
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,247
to adopting Metal
on their OS X apps,

354
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,613
seeing performance
increases up to 8x.

355
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,582
They are excited
about what it can do

356
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,750
for their Creative Cloud users.

357
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,949
Of course, Metal is
also fantastic for games

358
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,823
with a 10x improvement.

359
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,691
That's ten times improvement
in drawing performance.

360
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,563
So we brought in Epic to
see what they could do

361
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,433
in short order, and the
results are really phenomenal.

362
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,273
I'd like to welcome to
the stage Josh Adams

363
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,309
and Billy Bramer
for a quick demo.

364
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,675
[Applause]

365
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,114
Thank you,
Craig.

366
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,910
Thank you very much for
having us here today.

367
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,683
So last year Metal
revolutionized graphics on iOS,

368
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:42,293
and now Apple's amazed us again
by bringing Metal to the Mac.

369
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,028
Of course, this is
great news for games,

370
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:48,694
but also for the tools that
we use to make those games.

371
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,864
Here you are seeing Epic's
upcoming multiplayer title

372
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,064
Fortnite, running
entirely on Metal.

373
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,236
We are modifying it directly
within the Unreal Engine,

374
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,676
a development tool that powers
many of today's best games.

375
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,543
It's quite a bit going
on in this scene, though,

376
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,411
so let's break it down.

377
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,010
First, there are
64 different layers

378
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,613
of rendering effects,
and that's a lot.

379
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,056
All combining together, though,

380
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,491
to produce what you
see on the scene today.

381
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,557
If we go into a simple wireframe
mode, you can see the thousands

382
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,797
of building blocks that
make up this world.

383
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:25,033
We can start to add in layers,
flat shading, detailed lighting,

384
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,431
runtime shadows, and finally
we combine them all together

385
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,104
to bring Fortnite's fun and
lighthearted aesthetic to life.

386
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,503
The interesting thing
here, though,

387
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,746
is that all of the effects
you are seeing are being done

388
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,511
completely in real-time.

389
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,810
Notice how the shadows and
objects interact nicely

390
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,012
as Josh moves the car around.

391
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,384
Finally, we can change the
time of day on the fly,

392
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,684
dramatically altering the
mood of the entire scene.

393
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,587
All of this is thanks to
the efficiency of Metal.

394
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,760
In fact, we are seeing
a 70 percent reduction

395
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,300
in CPUs compared to OpenGL,
enabling developers like us

396
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,637
to create richer 3D worlds.

397
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:05,333
Speaking of those worlds, let's
hop into the game, Fortnite.

398
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,137
Now, if you've ever
built a pillow fort

399
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,439
and battled imaginary
monsters with your friends,

400
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,212
you already know how
to play Fortnite.

401
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,250
This is the end-of-the-world
scenario you have been training

402
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,285
for since you were a kid.

403
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,751
It's a beautifully
stylized universe.

404
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,050
You can destroy anything
you want.

405
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,952
Gather resources
and build a fort.

406
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,124
So let's go ahead
and wreck this car.

407
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,258
Gather its metal.

408
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,760
And continue our wanton
destruction by chopping

409
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,563
down this tree to get
some wood for later.

410
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:37,165
Did we mention there
are purple death storms,

411
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,909
like this one, for instance?

412
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,274
We should go.

413
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,772
Luckily, while we were out
exploring, we found a multitude

414
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,875
of weapons, and this broom.

415
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,078
If we can just get
across the field,

416
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,691
our friend has been busy
building a fort across the --

417
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,386
did we mention the storms
are made of monsters?

418
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,727
We are going to need something
a bit better than this broom.

419
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,995
Nice! There's our friend
laying down some covering fire.

420
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,737
Hey,
look out!

421
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,303
We call that move
the power cord.

422
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,509
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

423
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,647
You are going to
need a bigger fort.

424
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,243
Place a trap, head inside.

425
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,148
Looks like an enemy has
broken into our fort.

426
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,150
All right.

427
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,293
Let's use that wood we gathered
earlier to fix this wall,

428
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,589
build some stairs, meet up
with our friend topside.

429
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:42,668
Glad you could
make it.

430
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,808
[Monster screaming]

431
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,143
Whether you are a
gamer or a game developer,

432
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,739
Metal opens new possibilities
for rich and engaging worlds.

433
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,283
You can download the Unreal
Engine for Mac right now,

434
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,519
and the Fortnite beta
for Mac starts this fall.

435
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,585
Thank you very much.

436
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:03,123
[Cheers and applause]

437
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,662
CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
Thank you, guys.

438
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,995
That was great.

439
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,963
We have been totally impressed
with what Epic has been able

440
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,032
to accomplish in
such a short time.

441
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:15,601
And this is in part because the
work they did to adopt Metal

442
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:19,271
in their rendering engines for
iOS immediately pays dividends

443
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:22,641
on OS X, and we are seeing
this with many other developers

444
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,811
as well who are bringing their
gaming engines immediately

445
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,211
to the Mac.

446
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:30,213
And pro app makers are seeing
the benefits of Metal as well,

447
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,656
people like The Foundry
and Autodesk.

448
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,191
I think we are going to
see pro users, gamers,

449
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,987
and all of us benefiting

450
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,659
from the performance
advantages of Metal.

451
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,098
So that is El Capitan,
improvements

452
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,265
to experience and performance.

453
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:51,675
Now, El Capitan is available
to all of you developers today.

454
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,180
[Applause]

455
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:01,116
We will be doing a public
beta once again in July,

456
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,353
and we will be rolling
out to everyone

457
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,089
with a free upgrade this fall.

458
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,685
And that's our update on OS X.

459
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:16,628
[Applause]

460
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,029
Next -- you guessed it -- iOS.

461
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:22,731
Now, our current big
release of iOS is iOS 8,

462
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,605
and iOS 8 was a huge release
with tons of new features

463
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,605
for users and a phenomenal
set of technologies

464
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,808
that you developers
have been able to use

465
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,210
to deliver all-new
experiences to the platform.

466
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,654
The upgrade rate for
iOS has been fantastic.

467
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:42,391
We have 83 percent of active
iPhone users currently running

468
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,818
the latest OS.

469
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,192
And this is really important

470
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,830
because it means not only are
they getting the most recent

471
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,966
features, but they're also up to
date on all the security fixes,

472
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,434
and you're able to
know as a developer

473
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,573
that you can target
all the users

474
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,438
with the latest and
greatest APIs.

475
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,568
And this is a benefit

476
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,742
that actually remains
really unique to iOS.

477
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:10,483
[Applause]

478
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:14,252
So we are now looking forward
to iOS 9, and as we conceived

479
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,553
of what we wanted to
accomplish, first and foremost,

480
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:21,326
we wanted to elevate the
foundations of the platform,

481
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,597
things like extending
your battery life,

482
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,235
improving performance,
and enhancing security

483
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,572
to protect customer data.

484
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,467
But there was more
we wanted to do.

485
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,741
Adding intelligence throughout
the user experience in a way

486
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,341
that enhances how
you use your device

487
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,344
but without compromising
your privacy.

488
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:45,117
Things like improving the
apps that you use most

489
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:49,757
and taking the experience of
the iPad to the next level.

490
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,995
I want to start today with
intelligence and Siri.

491
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,562
Now, Siri has quietly
become incredibly popular.

492
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:01,033
It serves over a billion
requests per week.

493
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,733
And this is in part because
Siri has gotten so great

494
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,066
at understanding
what we are saying.

495
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,740
In just the last year, we've
seen a 40 percent reduction

496
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,481
in word error rate,
down to 5 percent.

497
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,978
That's an industry
leading number.

498
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,250
And Siri is 40 percent
faster than ever

499
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,389
at responding to what we say.

500
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:24,726
Now, for iOS 9, Siri has a
beautiful new UI and is capable

501
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,763
of doing so much more.

502
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,429
Things like "show me photos

503
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:32,997
from Utah last August" can
instantly show you the right

504
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,368
photos from your photo library.

505
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,837
And Siri's really great
at taking reminders.

506
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,207
Now you can ask Siri
things like "remind me

507
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,676
to grab my coffee off the
roof of my car when I get in."

508
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,776
Because Siri knows now when
you've gotten in the car.

509
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,120
And of course, we often want
to take reminders about things

510
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,555
that we are looking at on our
device, some content inside

511
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,591
of our app, maybe a Safari.

512
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,856
Now you can say things
like "remind me about this

513
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,556
when I get home," and that
reminder refers right back

514
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,700
with a link to specifically
what you were looking

515
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,335
at when you took that reminder.

516
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,801
So Siri is a great assistant.

517
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:12,301
But the best assistants
are proactive.

518
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,874
And so on iOS 9, we are
bringing proactivity throughout

519
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,444
the system.

520
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,343
So say you like to run in
the morning, and when you do,

521
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,215
you like to listen to music.

522
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,514
Well, now your phone can
learn that about you,

523
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,486
and when you plug
in your headphones,

524
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,125
can offer up Now Playing
automatically right

525
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,891
on the Lock screen.

526
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:35,829
[Applause]

527
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,768
And this is all
context-sensitive to the time,

528
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,034
the place, and even the
devices you are connected to,

529
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,073
so you do the same thing in the
car later on, and it might offer

530
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,369
up the audio book that you
have been listening to.

531
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,273
Now, as a great assistant,

532
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,315
your iPhone can now take
invitations you receive

533
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,682
in your email and without you
even touching them automatically

534
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,851
put them on your calendar
and even give you a time

535
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,051
to leave reminder, taking

536
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,193
into account current traffic
conditions, and of course,

537
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,459
with just a swipe, give you
access to driving directions.

538
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,900
Now, have you ever had this
happen to you, you get a call,

539
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,198
the number looks
kind of familiar,

540
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,039
but you are really
not sure who it is?

541
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,104
As a great assistant, your
phone can now look in your email

542
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,674
and find out who that person
might be and suggest it

543
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,744
to you right on the
Incoming Call screen.

544
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,943
It's super handy.

545
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:31,484
[Applause]

546
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,423
Now, this kind of
proactivity is also great

547
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,890
when it comes to Search.

548
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,859
So now when you swipe to the
left of the Home screen to get

549
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,927
to Search, you see that Siri
offers great suggestions,

550
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,868
things like the people that you
might want to contact now based

551
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,704
on your upcoming meetings and
your communication patterns,

552
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,070
the apps that you might want
to launch based, for instance,

553
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,140
on what you just downloaded
from the App Store and haven't

554
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,109
yet tried out, or apps you
tend to use this time of day,

555
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,509
and also easy one-tap
links to locations

556
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,413
that are relevant nearby,
and even breaking news.

557
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:09,486
When it comes to Search, we
also know more than ever before.

558
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:13,328
So for instance, you can
search for sports scores.

559
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,925
And we now support video
search, of popular video sites

560
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:19,828
like Vivi, Vimeo, YouTube,
and the iTunes Store.

561
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,531
And we have these
great descriptive cards

562
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,104
with a Play button so
you can play directly

563
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:26,903
from your search result.

564
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:32,015
Most importantly, we now
have an API for Search.

565
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:39,080
[Applause]

566
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,224
So now when a user
performs a search,

567
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,589
we can find content behind
the apps they have installed

568
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,060
on the device and pull those up
in Results, and when they tap,

569
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,061
they are deep-linked
directly into the application.

570
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,965
You see for instance
here Airbnb.

571
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,408
They can get their result.

572
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,473
Of course, we even provide
a convenient backlink

573
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,512
so they can get right back
to their search results.

574
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,608
So we think these kinds

575
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:10,212
of intelligence features
really make a huge difference

576
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,245
in your experience in iOS.

577
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,289
And to show you how, I would

578
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,855
like to give you
a quick demo now.

579
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:22,463
So I want to take you through
a day in the life with iOS 9,

580
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:28,801
and we are going to start with
a typical day for me today.

581
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,400
We are going to start
in my bedroom

582
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,203
when I woke up in the morning.

583
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,475
You will notice because my phone
knows that in the morning I

584
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:40,745
like to meditate that it's
offered me a meditation app

585
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,146
right here in the bottom
left of the screen.

586
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,888
So I can just swipe up
from the bottom left,

587
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:49,023
and I am taken right
in to meditate.

588
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,461
Ah, this is so serene.

589
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,766
Well, it looks like I got
a message here from Phil.

590
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:59,101
So Phil says that he is
putting together the invite

591
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,467
for tonight's big karaoke
potluck, and can I still pick

592
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,407
up this super awesome
karaoke machine?

593
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,904
Well, you know, Siri actually,
when I take reminders,

594
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,276
is able to link me right back
to what I am looking for,

595
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,415
so if I want to remember to pick
this up, I can just say this

596
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:16,411
to Siri: "Remind me
about this later today."

597
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:22,325
And so Siri will put
together a reminder,

598
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,960
and you see the link right
back to what I am looking for.

599
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,258
Well, I think after all,
meditation isn't probably

600
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,801
for me, so maybe I'll
move on to exercise.

601
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,838
So I head into the home gym
here, and because my phone knows

602
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,606
that when I am in the home gym
and I hook up headphones and I

603
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,105
like to listen to music,
watch what happens when I plug

604
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,908
in the cord of my headphones.

605
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:49,982
Jumps right in and offers
me some energetic music.

606
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,221
So let's all bust a move.

607
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,856
I don't know what kind

608
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,122
of exercise we are all
doing here, but pretty good.

609
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,222
Looks like actually
I've got that invitation

610
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,264
that Phil was going to send me.

611
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,999
Now, normally I would have
to actually go into Mail,

612
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,835
look at the time, put this
on my Calendar, but in fact,

613
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,732
my phone has automatically
done that for me.

614
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,574
Let me just swipe down here
into Notifications Center,

615
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,270
and we will look at my
calendar for the day.

616
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:18,482
You notice it automatically has
already been added right there.

617
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,047
Now, if we look at
the rest of my day,

618
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,045
ahead I have my vocal warm-ups

619
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,587
for the karaoke performance,
then WWDC.

620
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:29,254
It looks like I have
a little bit of time

621
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,324
to prepare my dish
for the big potluck.

622
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,223
So I am going to head
into the kitchen now,

623
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,896
and let's just swipe in.

624
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,594
When I am looking for
recipes, for instance,

625
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,526
I like to go into Search.

626
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,730
Let's just swipe
over into Search.

627
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,432
We see Siri has actually already
-- before I typed a character --

628
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,236
made suggestions for me
for people I could contact,

629
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,139
for instance, like Trent
Reznor, my vocal coach.

630
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,342
[Laughter] So I can just tap.

631
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,414
Here I can call Trent up,
and he can help me tap

632
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,912
into my inner pain and
rage that allows me

633
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,455
to fuel my vocal performances.

634
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,550
I actually haven't been
able to find the pain

635
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,692
and rage, truth be told.

636
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,587
Also, we have all these
great apps I can run

637
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,930
and locations nearby -- for
instance, because it's morning,

638
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,427
you see coffee and tea and
breakfast places are suggested.

639
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,099
As well as news.

640
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,138
But in this case, I
actually want to do a search.

641
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,173
So I have some potatoes
I think I could make use

642
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,339
of in this recipe.

643
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,306
So let's just search for potato.

644
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:23,175
Here you notice I am
getting search results right

645
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,575
from Yummly.

646
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,016
Let me tap into Yummly, and you
see I am deep-linked directly

647
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,383
in, so I get the great view
provided by that application.

648
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,583
Now, potato chips aren't
exactly what I am looking for,

649
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,185
so I am going to hit
the Back link here,

650
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,687
and I can browse directly

651
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,258
in to another result,
Canadian Poutine.

652
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,198
That looks exactly like
what the doctor ordered.

653
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,995
Yes. Let's look at
the ingredients.

654
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:49,067
Looks like 6 tablespoons
of unsalted butter.

655
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,207
I am down with that.

656
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,742
I am going to make at
least a double batch.

657
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:58,708
So I can just use Search to do
a conversion of tablespoons,

658
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,950
figure out how much that is.

659
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,515
So that actually
is 3/4 of a cup.

660
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,784
I am going to round
up to an even quart

661
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:09,123
and make myself some
fine poutine.

662
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,620
[Laughter] So Search
is really handy,

663
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,293
but Siri is also
great at search.

664
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,492
So I want to jump
forward to later today.

665
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,804
When I think I will be
reminiscing about WWDC's past.

666
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,269
I can ask Siri to
help me with that.

667
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:30,139
Show my photos from last
June in San Francisco.

668
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:34,251
Oh, yeah, this is great,
all these photos from WWDC.

669
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:37,316
You notice now Photos in iOS
9 has this great scrubber bar

670
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,355
at the bottom, so
I can easily slide

671
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,351
through photos super
quickly, just like this.

672
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,854
Oh, boy, now we are
into the karaoke night.

673
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,357
This is some fine stuff.

674
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,799
Phil really does an
awesome Viking crooner.

675
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,795
This is good stuff.

676
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,166
But of course, the
king of karaoke --

677
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,536
[Laughter] -- Eddy Cue.

678
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,704
In fact, when I want to get
really pumped up and inspired

679
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,543
for karaoke night,
I like to turn

680
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:05,278
to my Eddy karaoke album,
so let's do that now.

681
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,547
Show my karaoke photos of Eddy.

682
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:15,725
Oh, that is the master at work.

683
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,230
Hitting -- I love this hat.

684
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,267
[Laughter] This is totally dope.

685
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,463
Great stuff.

686
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,204
Well, I could really look
at these just all day,

687
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,499
but you know, actually,

688
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:32,001
my assistant has given
me a reminder based

689
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,103
on traffic conditions that it's
time to leave, so I am going

690
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,375
to wrap up this demo of
intelligence on iOS 9.

691
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:45,785
[Cheers and applause]

692
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,054
So you've seen how
we've been able

693
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:52,092
to bring intelligence throughout
the experience in iOS 9,

694
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:58,060
but we do it in a way that does
not compromise your privacy.

695
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:02,003
We don't mine your email,
your photos, or your contacts

696
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,139
in the cloud to learn
things about you.

697
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,875
We honestly just
don't want to know.

698
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,672
All of this is done on
device, and it stays

699
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,416
on device, under your control.

700
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:22,052
[Cheers and applause]

701
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,553
And if we do have to perform
a lookup on your behalf,

702
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,456
for example, for current traffic
conditions, it's anonymous,

703
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,259
it's not associated with your
Apple ID, it's not linked

704
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,701
with other Apple services,

705
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,266
and it's not shared
with third parties.

706
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,135
Why would do you that?

707
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,473
It is in your control.

708
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,439
That is intelligence in iOS 9.

709
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:46,478
[Applause]

710
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,678
Next, let's turn to Apple Pay.

711
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,650
And to take you through
it, I'd like to bring

712
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,889
to the stage our Vice President

713
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,255
of our Apple Pay
business, Jennifer Bailey.

714
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,454
Jennifer.

715
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:01,495
[Cheers and applause]

716
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,263
JENNIFER BAILEY:
Thanks, Craig.

717
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,160
It's great to be here.

718
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,404
We have been hard at work on our
goal of replacing the wallet,

719
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,601
and we've got some exciting
updates for you today.

720
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,504
I hope you've all tried Apple
Pay with our super easy, secure,

721
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,608
and private way to pay.

722
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,010
Last year we started with credit
and debit cards, and we now have

723
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,383
over 2,500 banks
supporting Apple Pay.

724
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,953
And this fall, Discover will
bring Apple Pay to the more

725
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,493
than 50 million card members.

726
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:36,929
[Applause]

727
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,528
Popular merchants are also
expanding their acceptance

728
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,302
for Apple Pay, including
great retailers

729
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,371
who will be supporting
Apple Pay this year,

730
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,010
including Trader Joe's,
Baskin-Robbins, and JCPenny.

731
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:53,278
These incredible brands join
a great list of the biggest

732
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:55,278
and best merchants
supporting Apple Pay

733
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,750
since our launch in October.

734
00:36:56,748 --> 00:37:00,318
And for you are basketball
fans, if you are lucky enough

735
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,988
to have finals tickets,
you will be able to pay

736
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,527
for all your team logo wear at
both arenas using Apple Pay.

737
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:12,565
[Applause]

738
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,134
Small businesses are
also important for us,

739
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,533
so we are working with
innovative companies like Square

740
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,135
to enable millions of small
businesses to accept Apple Pay.

741
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:26,309
This fall, Square will
launch a gorgeous new reader.

742
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:29,511
Preorders are starting
today on square.com,

743
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,684
and these will be available

744
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:34,052
in our Apple Retail
Stores starting this fall.

745
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:38,122
With fantastic support of
merchants, both large and small,

746
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:42,093
we will surpass 1 million
locations accepting Apple Pay

747
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,563
next month.

748
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:49,301
[Applause]

749
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,270
And thanks to our
amazing developers,

750
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,770
we have great momentum
within apps as well.

751
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,872
Apple Pay is so easy
to use in-app,

752
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:01,016
our developers are telling
us they are seeing more

753
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,752
than two times increase
in checkout rates.

754
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,019
And we are adding new
apps with Apple Pay

755
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,918
to the App Store every day.

756
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,420
Here are some of the latest,
representing a great range

757
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:15,092
of categories, from
Delta in travel to Etsy,

758
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,733
the leading crafts marketplace.

759
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:22,029
These apps join an incredible
group that are redefining new

760
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,733
and simpler ways to pay.

761
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:29,037
We're also excited to be
working with Pinterest.

762
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,710
Later this month, Pinterest
will launch Buyable Pins,

763
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,549
where you will be able to buy
items from thousands of stores,

764
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,387
including Neiman
Marcus and Macy's,

765
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:42,053
right from within the
Pinterest app using Apple Pay,

766
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,623
and only on iOS.

767
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:52,402
[Applause]

768
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,597
With the great momentum
of Apple Pay in the U.S.,

769
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,439
we are now excited to announce

770
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,634
that we are bringing
Apple Pay to the UK.

771
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:04,977
[Cheers and applause]

772
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,146
And it's coming next month!

773
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,686
[Applause]

774
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,981
We will launch with eight
of the most popular banks,

775
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,784
with more coming this fall.

776
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,227
With this great lineup of
banks, we will support more

777
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:23,123
than 70 percent of the credit
and debit cards in the UK.

778
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,897
Great merchants are also
lining up to support Apple Pay,

779
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:30,067
like Boots, Costa Coffee,
and iconic British brands,

780
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,108
like Marks and Spencer
and Waitrose.

781
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:36,173
We will have over 250,000
locations supporting Apple Pay

782
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,274
in the UK.

783
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,015
That's more than we
started with in the U.S.

784
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,450
at our initial launch.

785
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,886
We are also thrilled that
our customers will be able

786
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,851
to commute and pay
for their fares

787
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,690
on the London transportation
system with Apple Pay.

788
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:56,827
[Applause]

789
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,298
So that's Apple Pay
coming to the UK.

790
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:01,096
Now let's talk about
some of the new features

791
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,699
that we are adding in iOS 9.

792
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,971
First, you will be
able to add your store,

793
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,410
credit, and debit cards.

794
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,706
Store cards offer unique
membership benefits,

795
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,109
and leading retailers
like Kohl's, JCPenney,

796
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:19,613
and BJs will be the first to
offer their cards on Apple Pay.

797
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,657
We will also add loyalty
and rewards cards,

798
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,824
also with a great
lineup of merchants.

799
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,892
Kohl's will bring
Yes2You programs,

800
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,362
Walgreens their Balance Rewards
card, and for your coffee

801
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:35,062
and doughnut lovers, Dunkin'
Donuts will bring Apple Pay

802
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,736
to their DDPerks
beginning this fall.

803
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:44,246
[Applause]

804
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:47,912
and Apple Pay automatically
presents the right card,

805
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,112
so you will never miss a reward.

806
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,884
With the expansion of Apple
Pay and the new types of cards,

807
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:58,755
we decided it's time to
rename Passbook to Wallet.

808
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:04,926
[Applause]

809
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,199
One place for all your credit
and debit cards, loyalty cards,

810
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,699
boarding passes, and more.

811
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,572
We told you last year
that our ultimate goal was

812
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,241
to replace the wallet,
and we are well

813
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,209
on the way to doing just that.

814
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:22,149
We couldn't be happier with
the progress towards our vision

815
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,046
and with the momentum
of Apple Pay.

816
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,788
Thank you.

817
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:34,863
[Applause]

818
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:36,857
CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's Apple Pay.

819
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,031
Let's turn now to
our enhancements

820
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,940
to the apps you use most, and we
are going to start with Notes.

821
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,205
Notes is used regularly by about
half of our users on iPhone,

822
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,946
and for iOS 9, we have some
really great enhancements.

823
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,183
It starts with how you
work with simple text.

824
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,848
So now Notes provides
a really handy toolbar

825
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,319
with formatting options,
so it's easy, for instance,

826
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,218
to create titles, heading
styles, numbered lists.

827
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:07,722
But of course, we all like to
create checklists in our notes,

828
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,825
and so Notes makes
that really easy.

829
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,467
And of course, you can
just check off your items

830
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,203
with just a tap.

831
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,938
Now, because a picture is
worth a thousand words,

832
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,174
we make it easy to get at your
camera and your camera roll

833
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,241
and put photos directly
in your notes.

834
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:27,581
We are also providing a great
new way to capture your ideas

835
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,378
by just drawing with
your finger.

836
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,251
We provide some great
drawing tools.

837
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,220
You can make sketches
with these tools

838
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,858
and drop them right
inside your note.

839
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:41,054
[Applause]

840
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,798
Now, I don't know
if you are like me,

841
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:44,324
but a lot of times the
things I want to put

842
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,168
on my notes are things I
am looking at that I find

843
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,604
in other apps -- for
instance, a web page in Safari.

844
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,270
So now from the Share
sheet, you can just

845
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,510
with a tap add a link
right back into your notes.

846
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,307
And we make it really
easy to find your notes.

847
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,180
So we organize them
by time, of course,

848
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,779
and now we have these
great thumbnails

849
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,750
to let you see your
embedded images at a glance,

850
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,649
but we also provide this
cool new Attachments view

851
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:12,653
that shows you all of your
photos, your maps links,

852
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,657
your website links, and when
you tap, you can get right back

853
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,360
to the note where
they came from.

854
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,471
Now, Notes is great
on iPhone, on iPad,

855
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,036
and of course, on
the Mac as well.

856
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:26,734
And all of your content is
kept up to date across all

857
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,377
of your devices via iCloud.

858
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,913
That's a quick update to Notes.

859
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:37,579
[Applause]

860
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,552
Next, let's turn to Maps.

861
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,590
We've continued to
invest heavily in Maps,

862
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,757
and the improvements
are really awesome.

863
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:49,465
We are seeing five billion
user requests per week.

864
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,960
Usage on iOS is 3.5 times higher

865
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:56,134
than for the next
leading mapping app.

866
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,803
Now, Maps, of course,

867
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,542
historically have been
focused on drivers.

868
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:04,879
They emphasize things
like freeways and roads.

869
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:09,546
But we know for a lot of our iOS
users, they are mostly focused

870
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:13,847
on public transit, and so now
we've created a great map just

871
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,291
for them.

872
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,957
[Applause] Yes, it's Transit.

873
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,296
[Applause]

874
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,733
With Transit, we provide
a map that emphasizes all

875
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:28,029
of the different transit
lines, buses, and trains,

876
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:31,472
subway stations and so forth,
and when you tap on a station,

877
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,709
you can see all the
lines that run through it

878
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,274
with their departure times.

879
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:40,173
And we do multimodal routing,
whether you are taking a train,

880
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,047
a subway, a bus, or a ferry.

881
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,747
And we provide step-by-step
directions, including time

882
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,051
for walking directions.

883
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:52,292
But we've taken special care
to get the details right,

884
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,930
the ones that matter,
with Transit.

885
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:58,396
For instance, if you take a
subway station like this one

886
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:03,506
in Columbus Circle in New York,
it's not just a point on a map.

887
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,831
If you look closer,

888
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:08,035
it's actually an enormous
underground structure spanning

889
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:13,249
many city blocks, and so
we carefully surveyed all

890
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,744
of the entrances and exits

891
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,646
so that we could give you
walking directions based

892
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,789
on the time to travel from
where you actually are.

893
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:24,186
Now, this not only saves
you a ton of walking,

894
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,828
but it also probably
is the difference

895
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,923
between catching your train
on time and being stuck.

896
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,026
[Applause] It's really great.

897
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:37,338
[Applause]

898
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:40,605
We've taught Siri all about
Transit, so it's effortless

899
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,545
to ask Siri for directions.

900
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:46,811
And we are going to be
rolling Maps out, Transit,

901
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:51,821
starting with these cities
across the world, and --

902
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:55,056
[Applause] -- with these
and 300 more in China.

903
00:45:55,052 --> 00:46:02,262
[Applause]

904
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,999
Now, when it comes
to searching in Maps,

905
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,235
we are now letting
you find locations

906
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,430
by type nearby with just a tap.

907
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,772
And when you find the
location you are interested in,

908
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,769
the card will tell you
right away right there

909
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,141
in the bottom whether
they support Apple Pay.

910
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,080
Support those Apple
Pay merchants.

911
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,915
[Applause]

912
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,352
Maps is great on
iPhone and iPad,

913
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,849
and of course, the Mac as well.

914
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:31,093
And that is Maps.

915
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:37,958
[Applause]

916
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:42,562
The apps that we've chosen
to build in to iOS are there

917
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,106
because they represent
fundamental experiences

918
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,343
to living on a mobile device.

919
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:51,839
And there's been one that we've
been wanting to do for years,

920
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,342
something that so many of
us find ourselves wanting

921
00:46:55,346 --> 00:47:00,516
to do every day on our device,
and so today I'm pleased

922
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:04,318
to announce that we are
introducing a new application,

923
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,061
and it's called News.

924
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:10,428
News is beautiful content

925
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:15,198
from the world's greatest
sources personalized for you.

926
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,069
Now, here's an article in News.

927
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,109
It's absolutely stunning.

928
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,944
Now, publishers can easily
create beautiful content using

929
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:30,381
gorgeous imagery, custom
layout, and rich typography.

930
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:33,881
But News is also interactive,
and so to give you a look

931
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,654
at News in action,
I'd like to invite

932
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:39,724
to the stage our Vice
President of Application,

933
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,394
Product Management,
Susan Prescott.

934
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:43,163
Susan.

935
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,700
[Cheers and applause]

936
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:52,308
SUSAN PRESCOTT:
Thanks, Craig.

937
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,403
Thank you.

938
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:54,774
I am really excited
to be the first person

939
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:56,002
to show you our new News app.

940
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,406
It's right here on
the Home screen.

941
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,549
The first thing News wants to do
is get a sense of what I like,

942
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,885
so it's going to
give me a short list

943
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,880
of really great choices
to choose from.

944
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,823
And you'll see as I tap,
additional recommendations come

945
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,620
in on the bottom to give
you even more choices.

946
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,063
So I read Atlantic, Wired,
New York Times, and ESPN.

947
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,930
I am still with you, Warriors!

948
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,329
And Daring Fireball.

949
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:25,432
Topics, too, like science,
baking, and travel.

950
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:28,106
I could keep going, but I
think that's a great start,

951
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,475
so I will tap Done.

952
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,144
News creates a personalized
feed called For You.

953
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,785
It's based on the
choices I just made,

954
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:39,551
and it's all my News
in one place.

955
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:42,120
You can see it looks great.

956
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:48,359
It's easy to scan, and it
updates every time I check News.

957
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,529
The articles can
come from anywhere,

958
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:54,928
but the best ones are built
in our new Apple News format,

959
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,602
like this Wired article
featuring Rashida Jones,

960
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,771
awesome in Parks &
Rec and The Office.

961
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:05,011
Look at the rich
typography, beautiful images,

962
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:09,149
and my favorite part are
the really fun animations.

963
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,586
It's fast and fluid.

964
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:15,081
We think this offers the best
mobile reading experience ever.

965
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:19,025
To get to the next
article, I just swipe.

966
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:20,993
It's not just great
for magazines;

967
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,231
it's great for newspapers too.

968
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,496
This is a New York Times
article, and it looks

969
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,335
like a New York Times article.

970
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,100
Swipe down, there's a photo
gallery right in line, fast,

971
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,001
fluid to swipe through.

972
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,543
Go to the next article,
this one's from Quartz,

973
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,379
but I am seeing it because I
said I am interested in science.

974
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,576
It's a pretty cool
article about a font based

975
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,619
on Albert Einstein's
handwriting.

976
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:46,084
The animation makes it
come to life, and frankly,

977
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,783
who knew he had such
neat handwriting?

978
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,855
It's kind of interesting.

979
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:53,824
Swipe again, and I get an
article from Bon Appetit.

980
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,224
Great summer recipes,

981
00:49:56,227 --> 00:50:00,697
and a crazy little jiggly
thing, which is kind of fun.

982
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:03,438
[Laughter] So I am a little
busy right now, so I am going

983
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,034
to go ahead and bookmark
this to read later.

984
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:11,306
Now, ESPN, I love you, Steph.

985
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,548
[Applause]

986
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,315
Now, I read ESPN
for the articles,

987
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,754
but there's also
some beautiful --

988
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:24,321
[Laughter] -- photos and videos.

989
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:32,131
[Cheers and applause]

990
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,229
Some photos and videos built in.

991
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,231
Not so much last night.

992
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,202
Let's see if Steph
can make this one.

993
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,372
Swish. All right.

994
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,140
He is going to be
there for us next game.

995
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:47,949
In addition, data and stats are
part of what's fun about sports,

996
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:50,245
so of course, rich info
graphics can be part of it.

997
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,217
I am going to swipe
back to For You.

998
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,986
Now, News is smart, so the
more I read, the better it gets

999
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,556
at showing me stories
I am interested in.

1000
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,725
But what if I want to
discover something new?

1001
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,495
I can tap here in the bottom
on Explore, and Explore,

1002
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:06,826
based on what I've read,

1003
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,230
will show me new publisher
channels I might be interested

1004
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,604
in and suggested topics.

1005
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,503
Well, I love technology.

1006
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,575
I am going to go
ahead and follow that.

1007
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,313
But News keeps track of
more than a million topics.

1008
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,451
So I can be much more
specific about my interests.

1009
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,017
To do that, I can tap
on Search and type.

1010
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,216
I am going to type Swift.

1011
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:32,828
And I get a number of hits,
everything from Taylor Swift,

1012
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:33,993
to what I was looking for,

1013
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:36,161
Apple's new programming
language.

1014
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,960
So it's a beautiful feed,
and what's really cool

1015
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:43,104
about this is there are powerful
machine learning algorithms

1016
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,600
that analyze the contents
of the articles to figure

1017
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,842
out which stories
belong in which article.

1018
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,739
This looks like just
what I was hoping for.

1019
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:54,511
I am going to go ahead and
add Swift to my Favorites.

1020
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,151
So let's take a look
at Favorites.

1021
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,246
I will tap down here.

1022
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:01,188
Favorites is where I can see
everything I am following,

1023
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:04,025
including Swift,
which I just added.

1024
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,961
It's a great place to
go if I want to dig

1025
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,756
into a particular
topic or if I want

1026
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,798
to read a newspaper
or a magazine.

1027
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,763
Let's say today I
want to read Wired.

1028
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:14,033
You can tell I am in
the Wired channel.

1029
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,531
You see the Wired
logo at the top

1030
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:19,502
and the Wired channel
starting with Top Stories.

1031
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,773
I can swipe through and see a
collection of the all the print

1032
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:25,543
and web stories built
in Apple News format,

1033
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:26,542
and it looks terrific.

1034
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,683
I am going to look
at one more story.

1035
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:35,491
This is about the first
civilian artist in space.

1036
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,786
Cool concept and really cool.

1037
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:40,288
I want to show you this.

1038
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,990
We've taken photo
galleries to the next level

1039
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,363
with something we
call Photo Mosaics.

1040
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,702
Look how beautiful
it looks on the page.

1041
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:52,099
Stunning. And, as you'd expect,

1042
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:56,412
I just tap to zoom
in on the photos.

1043
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,607
It looks great.

1044
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:01,049
We think there's never been a
more beautiful magazine reading

1045
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,415
experience, a mobile reading
experience in general,

1046
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,714
and this is just
one of many channels

1047
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,486
with beautiful stories
built in Apple News format.

1048
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,385
That is a really
quick look at News.

1049
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,727
We can't wait to get
it in your hands.

1050
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,492
Thank you very much.

1051
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:22,570
[Cheers and applause]

1052
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,501
CRAIG FEDERIGHI:
So that's News.

1053
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,772
Stunning content.

1054
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,611
Personalized for you.

1055
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:34,276
Fantastic on iPad and
on iPhone as well.

1056
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,678
And of course, unlike just

1057
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,250
about any other news
aggregation service we are aware

1058
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:42,189
of on the planet, News is
designed from the ground

1059
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:45,256
up with your privacy in mind.

1060
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,825
We worked with leading
publishers,

1061
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,155
like The New York Times,

1062
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,299
who will be delivering 33
articles daily to News users,

1063
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:56,897
and ESPN, who will be
bringing the depth and range

1064
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,140
of their phenomenal
sports reporting.

1065
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:02,636
And Conde Nast, who are
bringing content from 17

1066
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,049
of their magazines, like
Vanity Fair, Vogue, GQ,

1067
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:09,214
Wired, and Bon Appetite.

1068
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:12,383
And they will be joined
by many, many others read

1069
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,982
by millions of users daily.

1070
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,585
News isn't just for
the media titans.

1071
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,659
Great content comes from
all kinds of sources,

1072
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:25,828
and we want them all in News, so
whether it's a local newspaper,

1073
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,029
a blog, or a special-interest
publication,

1074
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,572
they will all be here.

1075
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:35,477
We will be rolling out News
starting in the United States,

1076
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,112
the UK, and Australia.

1077
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,578
We think you are
really going to like it.

1078
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:49,087
[Applause]

1079
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,186
Next, let's turn to iPad.

1080
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:56,328
Now, iPad is a transformational
device.

1081
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:02,366
For our users in education,
business, and at home,

1082
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:07,176
for many of them, their iPad
is their primary computer.

1083
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:11,311
And iPads are just tremendously
powerful, so in iOS 9,

1084
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,508
we are elevating the iPad
experience to a whole new level.

1085
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,612
Now, it starts with
something really simple,

1086
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,384
which is how you work with text.

1087
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,884
That brings us to the
QuickType keyboard.

1088
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:26,256
Now, in iOS 8, we
introduced the Suggestion bar

1089
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,356
that makes it quicker
than ever to type

1090
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,128
and enter what you
are trying to get in.

1091
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:36,138
But now, in iOS 9, we've
added shortcuts to that bar,

1092
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:40,173
so with just a tap, you can cut,
copy, paste, format your text,

1093
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,610
access your attachments.

1094
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,375
It's really handy.

1095
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,843
But you know, what makes
a Multi-Touch keyboard

1096
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,483
so special is that it
can be anything you want.

1097
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,019
It can transform.

1098
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:55,984
So now when you want to move
the cursor or make a selection,

1099
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:59,456
you can now just put two
fingers down on the keyboard,

1100
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,656
and it becomes a
trackpad instantly.

1101
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:07,368
[Applause]

1102
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,764
You can move the cursor,
you can make selections.

1103
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,267
Of course, you can use
the shortcut bar to cut,

1104
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,610
drag to a new place, and
paste, editing more quickly

1105
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:19,207
than ever before and without
your fingers ever leaving the

1106
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:19,839
home row.

1107
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,683
It's really great.

1108
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:26,448
[Applause]

1109
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,890
And if you do occasionally want
to hook a physical keyboard

1110
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,925
to your iPad as well, we
made that better than ever.

1111
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:34,162
We provide a way to
discover all of the shortcuts

1112
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,097
that can accelerate
your operations

1113
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:38,263
in the applications
using the keyboard,

1114
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,932
and we've provided
shortcuts for app switching.

1115
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,501
This might look familiar
to some of you.

1116
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:46,699
As well as to searching
in Spotlight.

1117
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,503
So that's QuickType, but now
I want to turn to the big one,

1118
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,707
and that's Multitasking.

1119
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:58,649
[Applause]

1120
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:01,889
So iPad has always supported
forms of multitasking,

1121
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,085
like this great graphical
task switcher,

1122
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,187
and these nice four-finger
gestures

1123
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,889
that let you move
between applications.

1124
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:12,692
But for iOS 9, we are taking
it to a whole new place,

1125
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:15,736
and I'd like to show
that to you now.

1126
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:21,002
[Applause]

1127
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,304
So let's start here on my iPad.

1128
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:24,976
And what I am going to
do first is double-tap

1129
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:29,745
on the Home button, and you
will see our new task switcher.

1130
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,986
It's really gorgeous.

1131
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:36,692
Big, full-screen
previews of all the apps.

1132
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,527
Just move right into
Safari like this.

1133
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:40,662
But of course, often when
I am in an app like Safari,

1134
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,397
I then just want to
quickly check my messages.

1135
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:47,193
So now with just a single
finger swipe from the side,

1136
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,237
I can slide it right in with
what we call Slide Over.

1137
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,133
Of course, it's fully
interactive.

1138
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,135
I can take a quick look,
maybe type a response,

1139
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,208
put it right back,
I am back in Safari.

1140
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,807
Do that again.

1141
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:04,219
From the top, I can pull down
and bring in other applications.

1142
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,614
So let's bring in Calendar.

1143
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,555
Of course, fully interactive
so I can tap into another day.

1144
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:09,652
Let's bring in another app.

1145
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:13,293
I am going to bring
in the new Notes app.

1146
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,660
Just like that.

1147
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,458
Now, sometimes, of course, I
want to stay working in Notes

1148
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,500
and Safari both at the same
time, so I can just tap here

1149
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,336
on the divider, and
now I am in split view.

1150
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,172
They are both completely active.

1151
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:29,008
In fact, for the first time
ever, multiapp, Multi-Touch,

1152
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,805
I can move them both
at the same time.

1153
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:38,348
[Applause]

1154
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,048
Now, Notes is actually
pinned to the side now,

1155
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,791
so I want to show you what
happens when I switch apps.

1156
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:45,456
I am just going to move
over here to Photos.

1157
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,825
You notice now I have Photos
with Notes on the side.

1158
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,564
This is really great if I am
taking notes while working

1159
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,599
across a bunch of experiences.

1160
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:53,965
And of course those four-finger
gestures continue to work great,

1161
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:56,804
so I can swipe my way
right back into Safari.

1162
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,700
I can follow links, of
course, from my notes.

1163
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:03,873
Let me tap on this link, and you
see Safari loads it right here

1164
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:04,804
on the side.

1165
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,078
I can adjust the split.

1166
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,546
Let me move that over
to a nice 50/50 view

1167
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,145
with Notes and Safari.

1168
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:11,817
I can tap on links
to other apps,

1169
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:16,055
so let's follow a
link into Maps.

1170
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,452
Maps -- I really want
location accuracy.

1171
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,795
Thank you, very helpful.

1172
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,991
Slides right in and
shows me the location.

1173
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:26,434
I can follow another
link, Maps adjusts,

1174
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,470
I am able to stay
focused right here

1175
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,565
in these two apps side by side.

1176
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,407
Let's say I now want to
work Notes full screen.

1177
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,473
I can pull right
across like that

1178
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:37,112
and I am in full-screen Notes.

1179
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:38,547
This gives me a great
opportunity

1180
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:41,242
to show you what's new with
the QuickType keyboard.

1181
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,444
I have a to-do list
I am building here.

1182
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:49,887
I am going to add an item
here to buy a new ice chest.

1183
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,086
There we go.

1184
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,587
On second thought, I
should probably borrow one.

1185
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,260
I am going to take two fingers

1186
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,798
down on the keyboard,
swipe over here.

1187
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,194
I can reposition the
cursor like this.

1188
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,296
Tap and make a selection.

1189
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:03,738
Extend the selection.

1190
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:04,833
And type "borrow."

1191
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:06,105
It's really easy.

1192
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,442
I can make bigger moves too.

1193
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,537
I can go to the top here, maybe
select the whole sentence,

1194
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:16,110
drag down, maybe do a checklist
like this, and check them off.

1195
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,252
Just like that.

1196
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:18,917
Super cool.

1197
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:23,985
[Applause]

1198
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,927
Next I want to show you
multitasking in the context

1199
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:30,563
of something I think we all
do quite a bit on our iPads,

1200
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,830
which is not that --
which is watching ESPN.

1201
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,631
So let's bring up a video.

1202
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:40,033
I am going to play right here.

1203
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:43,476
Now, often when I am watching
a video, I may decide I want

1204
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,043
to look something up
or check something

1205
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,411
or maybe even get a
notification, and I want you

1206
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,881
to watch what happens
when I tap.

1207
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,050
Watch the video.

1208
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,948
Now I have Picture in Picture.

1209
01:00:53,950 --> 01:01:00,190
[Applause]

1210
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:04,590
So I can still listen, I
can watch my video, I can,

1211
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:08,364
of course, resize the
PIP if I want, like this.

1212
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:11,005
I can move it around the
screen so it's out of the way

1213
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,801
of what I am working on.

1214
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,142
I can even move it off the side.

1215
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,478
Sometimes I just want to listen
for a while while I work.

1216
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:20,244
Of course, it stays
with me wherever I go.

1217
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,583
I can pull it back,
and when I am done,

1218
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:23,879
just tap to put it away.

1219
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,990
And that is Multitasking
in iOS 9.

1220
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:34,825
[Applause]

1221
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,064
So iOS 9 delivers this great
app switcher, and of course,

1222
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,531
that's available
on iPhone as well.

1223
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,631
On iPad, we have Slide
Over so you can bring apps

1224
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,074
in from the side.

1225
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,309
You can tap and enter split view

1226
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:52,275
for simultaneous
live two apps up.

1227
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,945
And of course, Picture
in Picture.

1228
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:58,415
Now, we provide developer APIs
to let your apps work this way,

1229
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:02,355
and the good news is that you've
already done most of that work

1230
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:05,322
because if you've adopted
Auto Layout and size classes

1231
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:09,262
to work great on the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus, well, that carries

1232
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:13,599
over just like this onto iPad.

1233
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:16,467
Twitter came in and was able
to do it just in minutes.

1234
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,066
It was really incredible.

1235
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:24,209
Now, Slide Over is available
for the iPad Air, Air 2, mini 2,

1236
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,977
and mini 3, as is
Picture in Picture,

1237
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:29,547
and our most powerful
split view is available

1238
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:33,486
on our most powerful
iPad, the iPad Air 2.

1239
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,053
That's Multitasking.

1240
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:43,191
[Applause]

1241
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:46,433
So we've seen some
great end-user features,

1242
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,269
but of course, we've also
focused on the foundations.

1243
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:56,206
In performance, as you saw
earlier in El Capitan with OS X,

1244
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:59,206
we've taken the core frameworks
that we use for drawing

1245
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,709
on the system, Core
Animation and Core Graphics,

1246
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:02,911
and we put them on top of Metal.

1247
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,912
We are seeing great
acceleration,

1248
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:08,684
1.6 times improvements in
animations and scrolling,

1249
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:11,625
and a 50 percent reduction
in CPU usage for drawing.

1250
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,391
It's really great.

1251
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,430
With battery life, we focused

1252
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:19,165
on real-world use cases
and optimized them.

1253
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:23,402
And we are seeing an addition
of one hour of typical use

1254
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,100
on a full charge on iPhone.

1255
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:30,512
[Applause]

1256
01:03:30,507 --> 01:03:32,777
Now, we know that for a lot
of you if you are running low

1257
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:35,376
on power, you start searching
all over for switches

1258
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,218
and turning off features
in the hope

1259
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,353
of extending your battery
life a little bit further.

1260
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,320
Well, now in iOS 9, we
give you a single switch

1261
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,359
to enter what we call Low
Power mode, and it pulls levers

1262
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,896
that you didn't even
know existed and is able

1263
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:53,462
to extend battery life for
an additional three hours

1264
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,963
of typical use on top
of that additional hour.

1265
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,135
It's really great.

1266
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:02,943
[Applause]

1267
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,979
Now, with security, we want
to protect our users' data

1268
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,615
on device and in the cloud,

1269
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,250
and so we are bringing
two-factor authentication

1270
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:15,216
and making it easy for everyone
to protect their data in iCloud.

1271
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:20,428
And with Software Update, we
want everyone to get to iOS 9,

1272
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,523
and so we've done major
enhancements to the architecture

1273
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,797
for our over-the-air
updates, and we have been able

1274
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:31,136
to reduce the amount of free
space you need to get to iOS 9

1275
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:35,134
from the 4.6 gigs that
it took to get to iOS 8

1276
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,808
down to just 1.3, so we
think everybody is going

1277
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,177
to be getting to iOS 9.

1278
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:45,345
[Applause]

1279
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:48,348
So iOS 9, intelligence
throughout the system,

1280
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:53,121
Apple Pay, enhancements to
really popular apps like Notes

1281
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:58,533
and Maps, an all-new News app,
and incredible features now

1282
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:01,928
for iPad with Multitasking
and QuickType, and of course,

1283
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,301
enhancements to the foundations.

1284
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,270
Now, iOS 9 is a great release
for our users, but once again,

1285
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:13,512
it's a fantastic release
for all of you developers,

1286
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,010
bringing a ton of new features.

1287
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,551
You saw search extensibility.

1288
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:19,486
We are adding UI
testing to Xcode.

1289
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,582
[Cheers and applause] Yes!

1290
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,683
We have a new technology
called App Thinning,

1291
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,857
which optimizes your
downloads to exactly the subset

1292
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,857
of resources needed for that
user's device, so you are able

1293
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,230
to get -- take less
space on device.

1294
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:34,729
It's really great.

1295
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:37,871
Now, when it comes to gaming,
we've enhanced SpriteKit,

1296
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:41,537
SceneKit, and Metal and
introduced three new frameworks,

1297
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:44,038
GameplayKit to bring
artificial intelligence

1298
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,380
with path avoid obstacle
avoidance and path finding;

1299
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:50,618
Model I/O to provide
beautiful lighting

1300
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,553
on your 3D models;
and ReplayKit.

1301
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,690
It lets you enhance
your applications

1302
01:05:55,685 --> 01:06:00,195
to let users record their game
play as video and share it.

1303
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,260
It's really great.

1304
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:08,798
[Applause]

1305
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,468
Now, HealthKit has been on
fire, so we've continued --

1306
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,668
well, we added water,
actually, to HealthKit.

1307
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,411
We are not trying
to put out the fire.

1308
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:20,376
We are adding lots of additional
health metrics to be tracked,

1309
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:23,746
for instance, hydration,
UV exposure,

1310
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,486
and reproductive health.

1311
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,251
Now, HomeKit has been taking off

1312
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,592
with manufacturers
introducing HomeKit peripherals

1313
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:36,758
to the market now in areas like
thermometers, locks, and lights.

1314
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,229
And now in iOS 9, we
are adding support

1315
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:42,229
for window shades,
sensors of all kinds.

1316
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:46,002
For instance, carbon monoxide
sensors, motion sensors.

1317
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,872
And we're adding support for
security systems as well.

1318
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:52,443
Perhaps most importantly,
we are allowing you

1319
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:57,252
to access your home remotely
and securely via iCloud.

1320
01:06:57,247 --> 01:07:00,047
So no matter where you
are, you can control all

1321
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,319
of your HomeKit devices.

1322
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:09,558
[Applause]

1323
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,059
Next, CarPlay.

1324
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:16,330
So CarPlay supports audio
apps and now, in iOS 9,

1325
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,932
it also supports apps by the
automaker to control things

1326
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:24,036
in your own car without
leaving the CarPlay experience.

1327
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,540
And CarPlay is supporting
more kinds of screens,

1328
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,842
wider aspect ratios, high DPI.

1329
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:32,885
But most significantly
with CarPlay,

1330
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,252
we are pulling the cord.

1331
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:38,391
In future cars, you will
be able to get in your car

1332
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:42,158
without taking your phone out of
your bag or out of your pocket

1333
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:46,098
and start experiencing
CarPlay effortlessly.

1334
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,365
It's going to be really great.

1335
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:53,374
[Applause]

1336
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:57,369
Finally, let's talk about Swift.

1337
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:02,343
[Cheers and applause]

1338
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,815
You all know that the growth

1339
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:07,413
that Swift has been experiencing
is just unprecedented,

1340
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,517
and we've all seen
it with the flood

1341
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,789
of applications coming
in to the App Store.

1342
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:18,099
Well, now we are stepping on
the gas this year with Swift 2.

1343
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,434
Now, Swift was designed from
the beginning to be fast,

1344
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,831
and we've continued to roll

1345
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,772
out targeted optimizations all
year long, and now with Swift 2,

1346
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,939
we have an all-new optimization
technology that's especially

1347
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,409
great for complex applications
and object-oriented programming

1348
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,409
that we call Whole
Module Optimization,

1349
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,812
and the results are
really fantastic.

1350
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,456
In addition, we are bringing
the language features

1351
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,352
that you've asked for most,

1352
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:46,524
an elegant new error
handling model,

1353
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,322
the ability to see
your interfaces

1354
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,894
as synthesized headers
in Xcode, and the feature

1355
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:56,404
that Tim has been begging for
all year, protocol extensions.

1356
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,099
You are all going to love it.

1357
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:04,612
Now, we think Swift is the
next big programming language,

1358
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,077
the one that we will
all be doing application

1359
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:11,916
and systems programming
on for 20 years to come.

1360
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:17,524
And we think Swift should be
everywhere and used by everyone,

1361
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,560
and so we're going to be
doing something really big.

1362
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:25,466
Today we are announcing that
Swift will be open source.

1363
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:34,541
[Cheers and applause]

1364
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,855
We will be rolling
out the compiler

1365
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:56,964
and the standard libraries
for iOS, OS X, and Linux.

1366
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:02,599
And it will all be out there
by the end of the year.

1367
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:04,538
So that's Swift,
and that is iOS 9.

1368
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,774
We are doing a developer
beta -- you guessed it --

1369
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,940
today, and for the first
time for a major iOS release,

1370
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,810
a public beta, so sign
up now at beta.apple.com,

1371
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,151
and you can get the beta
when it comes out in July.

1372
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,086
And of course, we
will be rolling it

1373
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:21,182
out as a free upgrade
in the fall.

1374
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:25,984
And iOS 9 will support
all of the devices

1375
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,688
that were supported by iOS 8.

1376
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,090
We are not dropping
any this year

1377
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:32,032
because we want everyone
to get iOS 9.

1378
01:10:32,028 --> 01:10:33,928
[Applause]

1379
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:34,830
That's iOS 9.

1380
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,631
I really appreciate your time.

1381
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:37,472
Have a fantastic conference.

1382
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:38,537
Thank you.

1383
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:45,944
[Cheers and applause]

1384
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,742
TIM COOK: Thanks,
Craig.

1385
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:52,885
iOS just keeps getting better
and better for our many hundreds

1386
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:56,182
of millions of users,
and iOS 9 takes it

1387
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:59,225
to an even greater level
with incredible new apps

1388
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:02,462
and intelligence
built right into iOS.

1389
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:06,898
And as an avid iPad user, I
am also incredibly excited

1390
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:11,836
about how far it extends the
iPad experience as we continue

1391
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,974
to lead in the post-PC era.

1392
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,841
With El Capitan, we've
created a new version of OS X

1393
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:22,011
that dramatically
improves the experience

1394
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:26,081
and the user experience and the
performance of the Macintosh.

1395
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:27,982
And of course, Swift.

1396
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:32,624
You've just heard Swift provides
a single language for you

1397
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:38,292
to create apps for
both OS X and iOS.

1398
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,434
There's really so many
possibilities for you

1399
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:46,331
to use these platforms
and these tools

1400
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:50,905
to create unbelievable apps
that will impact business

1401
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:56,747
and healthcare and education and
really everything in our lives.

1402
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:01,856
There's seemingly no
limit to what you can do.

1403
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:08,391
And of course, underpinning
this, the App Store is very key.

1404
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:13,261
It's hard to believe that the
App Store was launched only

1405
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,262
seven years ago.

1406
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:18,404
It's hard to remember
a day without it.

1407
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:20,601
Now, I'm happy to announce

1408
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:25,613
that the App Store recently
passed a major milestone.

1409
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:34,688
The App Store has passed
100 billion apps downloads.

1410
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:41,524
[Applause]

1411
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:45,064
The rate of growth
and the momentum is

1412
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,601
absolutely staggering.

1413
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:51,437
The industry has never seen
anything like this before.

1414
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:54,074
The App Store has
forever changed software

1415
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,870
and software distribution.

1416
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,612
And it's also been
an economic boon.

1417
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:04,680
We've now paid over $30
billion to developers.

1418
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:09,050
[Applause]

1419
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,551
The App Store continues

1420
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:17,123
to be the most profitable app
marketplace on the planet.

1421
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:24,596
Now, we could not be more proud
of the work that you are doing.

1422
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,070
More and more, developers
are transforming, empowering,

1423
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,612
and reimagining the
very important things

1424
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,748
that we do in our daily lives.

1425
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:41,315
We've made a video about
your incredible impact

1426
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:46,187
and just how far you've come
in such a short period of time,

1427
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,728
and I'd love to run
it for you now.

1428
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,006
Eight years ago, when
the iPhone was launched,

1429
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:01,342
it didn't have an App Store.

1430
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:06,507
And there was tremendous desire
on the part of developers

1431
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:08,549
and customers for Apple

1432
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,914
to let third-party
applications be created.

1433
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:15,153
We all had this dream
that apps were going

1434
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:19,521
to become really important,
but it took some time

1435
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:22,622
to realize how they would affect
everything that we care about,

1436
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:27,965
and as that cumulative effect
appeared, then we all start

1437
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:30,103
to realize, oh, my
goodness, this is bigger

1438
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:32,139
than any of us imagined.

1439
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:41,341
Apps plus handheld
devices,

1440
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:45,414
I think that's a watershed
moment in civilization.

1441
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,914
I put it up there
with the invention

1442
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,786
of the microscope
and the telescope.

1443
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:56,154
We live in a time where the most
powerful tools ever imagined

1444
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:00,128
to investigate and probe
our world are in the hand

1445
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:02,269
of essentially everyone.

1446
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,406
If you think the Industrial
Revolution was transformational,

1447
01:15:06,402 --> 01:15:08,442
the App Store is way bigger.

1448
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,677
I don't think we've seen
anything reach a mass adoption

1449
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,114
at anything close to this pace.

1450
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:16,949
It took, for example,
electricity over a hundred years

1451
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:19,346
to get to its first
50 million users.

1452
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,848
It took television 13
years, and the App Store got

1453
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,352
to 50 million users
in only 17 months.

1454
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,865
The thing the App
Store did was give each

1455
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,468
and every developer a voice.

1456
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:44,139
It's a testament that two
guys in a room working

1457
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:47,540
on an idea can launch an app
and instantly have hundreds

1458
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,083
of millions of people
very quickly.

1459
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:54,788
The iPhone made photography
universally accessible.

1460
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,559
I cannot think
of a single industry

1461
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,529
that doesn't need an app.

1462
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:07,598
People want data at
their fingertips.

1463
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,866
They want personalized
experiences.

1464
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,205
They want power over
their money.

1465
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:16,772
And it's not just for banking;
it's for every industry.

1466
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,512
The App Store has fundamentally
shifted how we all need

1467
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:20,338
to deliver.

1468
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:23,412
It's leveling the playing field.

1469
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,115
We don't have to own
things.

1470
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:31,418
We don't have to
own our own cars.

1471
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,490
We don't have to
own our own music.

1472
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:37,229
We can call it up
when we need it.

1473
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:39,496
That's a big change, all
flowing from the idea

1474
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:42,265
of not just convenience
but people building

1475
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,704
up an infrastructure
around that.

1476
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,940
We are now talking
not about hundreds

1477
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:52,207
of people getting the benefits
of an idea, but millions.

1478
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,746
If you had told me when I
was a kid that you would be able

1479
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:04,558
to write an idea and then film
that idea and then distribute it

1480
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,723
to the world on a device
that you could also put

1481
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:10,092
in your pocket, I would
never have stopped laughing,

1482
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:12,862
and I would have
thought you were insane.

1483
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:15,132
The App Store gives
everyone access

1484
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:19,070
to incredibly powerful tools,

1485
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:22,168
and there's an incredible
generation of filmmakers

1486
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:24,111
and storytellers to come.

1487
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:37,256
Kids love technology,
and they love interacting

1488
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:40,893
with the iPad and with apps.

1489
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:44,860
That wonder and awe that gets
ignited is actually being

1490
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,030
utilized to help
that person learn.

1491
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,430
Certainly in education
there's so much potential

1492
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:53,772
to take the classroom
with you anywhere.

1493
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,776
We all know we are
in this magic moment.

1494
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:05,176
There are so many incredible
apps, and they do things

1495
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,520
for people that change
their lives.

1496
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,222
Music for me,
it's like everything.

1497
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:13,561
It's really special.

1498
01:18:13,556 --> 01:18:21,166
This amazing feeling that
music gives me, I want everyone

1499
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:25,263
to have that, even if
the person cannot hear.

1500
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:32,337
So the idea of the app is to
introduce music for deaf people.

1501
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:38,051
I am going to put these on
your wrist, so if you play,

1502
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:42,417
you can feel the vibrations.

1503
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,552
I can
feel it.

1504
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,553
Did you feel
that, Rob?

1505
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:57,366
My dream is to bring
music to everyone.

1506
01:19:01,637 --> 01:19:04,807
It is an amazing
time to be a developer.

1507
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:07,507
We are still just at the
beginning of all this,

1508
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:11,619
this moment where the technology
of an iPhone and an iPad

1509
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:16,484
and the Watch enable so
many incredible things.

1510
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,654
There's so much that can
still change and evolve due

1511
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:24,057
to the power of applications.

1512
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:33,139
[Music]

1513
01:19:54,590 --> 01:20:03,670
[Applause]

1514
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:09,902
TIM COOK: On behalf
of everyone at Apple,

1515
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,845
we want to thank the
developer community

1516
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,540
for everything that you've done.

1517
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,112
Thank you.

1518
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:18,280
[Applause]

1519
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,450
You have changed so many
parts of all of our lives

1520
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:28,691
and transformed the
world in the process.

1521
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:32,991
Now, we want to talk about
now the next opportunity

1522
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,395
to transform the world.

1523
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:40,966
And that's the opportunity to
bring native apps to the Watch

1524
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:44,139
with a new version of watchOS.

1525
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:49,679
[Applause]

1526
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,948
For us, this is a giant moment.

1527
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:59,560
This is how we felt when
we launched the App Store.

1528
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:02,655
Opening a new platform
to developers

1529
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:07,428
to create new applications

1530
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,999
that can really change
people's lives.

1531
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,099
We really believe
deeply in this space.

1532
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:17,542
We believe in technology
designed for the wrist.

1533
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,809
And we believe by
opening up the platform

1534
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:25,118
that you will create
new and powerful uses

1535
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:28,354
that today we can
only begin to imagine.

1536
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:33,920
We began making the Apple Watch
available just six weeks ago,

1537
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:38,862
and it's pretty amazing that
today we're already talking

1538
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:43,031
about the next version
of the watchOS.

1539
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:48,001
This new version will have
great new capabilities,

1540
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:52,403
and it will bring native
apps right to your wrist.

1541
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:57,017
To tell you all about it, I'd
like to invite up my friend

1542
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:59,452
and colleague Kevin Lynch.

1543
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:00,218
Kevin.

1544
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:05,055
[Cheers and applause]

1545
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,553
KEVIN
LYNCH: Hi.

1546
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:11,760
So we're moving really fast on
watchOS, and I am super excited

1547
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,800
to talk with you about the
enhancements that are coming

1548
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:15,326
in watchOS, as well

1549
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,130
as the powerful new
abilities for app development.

1550
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,573
Let's start with
the enhancements.

1551
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:24,239
The enhancements include
great new Timepiece functions,

1552
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,179
improvements in communication
as well as in Health & Fitness,

1553
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:28,946
and support for the
new capabilities

1554
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,614
in Apple Pay, Maps, and Siri.

1555
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,813
Let's start with Timepiece.

1556
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:36,816
Now, already, Apple Watch
is a really great timepiece,

1557
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:39,519
the most customizable one in the
world, and a lot of that is due

1558
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:41,761
to the Watch faces and
how you can change them.

1559
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:44,927
We are adding some new
Watch faces in watchOS 2.

1560
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:47,627
That includes a beautiful
new Photos face to be able

1561
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,329
to select any photo you have and
create a Watch face out of it.

1562
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:53,902
You can create more than one and
switch between them as you like.

1563
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,642
Or you can select a photo album,

1564
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:56,977
and every time you
raise your wrist,

1565
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,272
you will see a different
photo from your album show up.

1566
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:02,444
It's a great way of seeing
your photos throughout the day.

1567
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,884
We went a little
further with this,

1568
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,320
and we shot some
photos ourselves.

1569
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,855
We did some time-lapse
photography

1570
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,420
in some beautiful
locations around the world.

1571
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:12,319
The way this works is
when you raise your wrist,

1572
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,591
you will see this
24-hour shoot we have done

1573
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:17,430
in different locations, and it
will be the current time there.

1574
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:19,326
If it's in noon, you
will see noon in London.

1575
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,698
If it's night, you'll
see Big Ben all lit up.

1576
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:23,067
We've done this not
only for London,

1577
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:24,705
but some other locations too.

1578
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,900
You can choose from
Hong Kong, Mack Lake --

1579
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:28,572
which a beautiful
place in the Sierras --

1580
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:32,110
as well as New York,
Shanghai, and London.

1581
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,947
It's a great way to see really
beautiful imagery, both your own

1582
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,683
and these time-lapse
images, on your wrist.

1583
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:40,218
You can customize your
Watch with these images

1584
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:42,315
but you can also choose to
show the information that you

1585
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,857
like on your Watch
face with something

1586
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,193
in traditional Watch terms
that's called Complications.

1587
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,090
With watchOS 2, we are really
excited to enable app developers

1588
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:54,334
to make your own Complications.

1589
01:23:54,329 --> 01:24:01,269
[Applause]

1590
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:03,910
So be able to do things
like show your flight time

1591
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:07,146
from United, see the state
of your home control system,

1592
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:09,412
look at the charge level
of your electric car,

1593
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:12,151
or see sports scores, for
example, from the MLB app.

1594
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,717
You can choose the
information that you most

1595
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,655
like to see right
on your Watch face.

1596
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,421
It's going to be
really, really cool.

1597
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,589
And this will work not
only on the modular face

1598
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,988
but across the others that
support Complications as well.

1599
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,390
You will be able to choose
from a variety of templates,

1600
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,163
and we'll make those
look beautiful in each

1601
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,061
of the different Watch faces.

1602
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,463
So it's going to be
a really fast way

1603
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:31,334
to look at this information.

1604
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,433
Now, we went further than this.

1605
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:34,104
We thought it's really
great to be able

1606
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,802
to see the current information,

1607
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,244
but what about future
information,

1608
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,939
like the weather later
today or your meeting

1609
01:24:39,942 --> 01:24:41,912
after the current one?

1610
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,080
And what if you could go
forward in time and actually see

1611
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,849
that information update
on your Watch face?

1612
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:48,618
Well, we are supporting
that in watchOS 2

1613
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:51,417
with something we
call Time Travel.

1614
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,720
And you will be able to
rotate your Digital Crown,

1615
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:56,292
and you can go both forward
and backward through time,

1616
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:59,431
and the information will
update right on your screen.

1617
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:00,858
Let's take a look here.

1618
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,432
So I've got my meeting in
the middle there and weather

1619
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,902
and the charge level of
the car and time in London.

1620
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:08,671
When I rotate the Crown, you
can see it's changing the time

1621
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,910
and showing me things
that are coming up.

1622
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:13,076
Now, we know a really popular
one here might be the stocks

1623
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:15,245
Complication, but we
haven't cracked that one yet.

1624
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:19,143
We are working on it.

1625
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,117
You can keep rotating,
keep going forward,

1626
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,456
get all the way to tonight.

1627
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,351
You can see I have a date
night tonight, weather is going

1628
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:27,023
to be good, time in London will
be 2:00 a.m. You can see all the

1629
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:30,192
information you like to see in
the time you want to look at it.

1630
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:32,692
Really, really fun
way to interact

1631
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:35,064
with time on your Watch.

1632
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,433
That's Time Travel.

1633
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:42,872
[Applause]

1634
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,541
Now, we also thought, What
would be a great experience

1635
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,240
for the Watch when it's on
your nightstand and charging?

1636
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:50,343
Well, we've come up with a
new user interface for this

1637
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,985
in watchOS 2 called
Nightstand Mode.

1638
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,181
When you put your Watch on
its side and it's charging,

1639
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,653
you will get this beautiful
display now of the time,

1640
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,692
and of course, you can set
an alarm that will wake you

1641
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:03,188
up in the morning, and it
will go something like this.

1642
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,391
[Alarm tone]

1643
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:07,494
So a beautiful little
bedside alarm clock now

1644
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:10,066
with Apple Watch, and
the buttons on the side

1645
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:13,605
and the Crown act as your
Snooze and your Off button.

1646
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:17,102
A really fun way to have a
Nightstand view on your Watch.

1647
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,805
Those are some of the great
new Timepiece functions

1648
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:22,378
that are coming in watchOS 2.

1649
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:23,977
Let's look at communication.

1650
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:25,349
Now, already Apple
Watch is great

1651
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,017
at communicating
with your friends.

1652
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,055
You can just press the side
button and see your 12 friends

1653
01:26:30,052 --> 01:26:31,422
that you have selected.

1654
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,560
Now, we realize that some of
you have more than 12 friends,

1655
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:36,555
so now in watchOS 2, you
can have different sets

1656
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:39,228
of friends you can select,
and you can add a friend right

1657
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:41,127
from your Watch by
pressing the plus sign

1658
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:43,729
and add a friend right there.

1659
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:45,502
Isn't that cool?

1660
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,570
[Applause]

1661
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,940
Now, when you are
communicating with someone,

1662
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:52,578
you can make a phone call or
send a message or send a drawing

1663
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:55,674
with Digital Touch, and now
in watchOS 2, you will be able

1664
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,547
to use multiple colors
in your drawings,

1665
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,486
so you can draw a
beautiful flower

1666
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,881
that has more than
just one color.

1667
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:05,383
Even my drawings are starting
to look better now with this.

1668
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,457
Also an email.

1669
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:08,125
You can already read
email on your Watch.

1670
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:11,523
With watchOS 2, you will
be able to reply to email.

1671
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:16,066
[Applause]

1672
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,934
And with the phone, you can
already take phone calls

1673
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:19,033
on your Watch.

1674
01:27:19,034 --> 01:27:20,504
We are now going to
support FaceTime Audio,

1675
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:22,542
so you will get really
high-fidelity calls right

1676
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,537
on your wrist.

1677
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:28,348
[Applause]

1678
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:29,913
And with Health & Fitness,

1679
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,851
already Apple Watch is a great
partner for Health & Fitness.

1680
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:36,248
With watchOS 2, we are enabling
your favorite fitness apps

1681
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,851
to run natively on the Watch

1682
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,893
so you can use them wherever
you are, and your workouts

1683
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:42,989
with these apps will
contribute directly

1684
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:45,361
to your all-day activity,
which will be really great,

1685
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,560
so if you go on a bike
ride, it will count.

1686
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:50,462
[Applause]

1687
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,935
We are also enabling
Siri to start workouts,

1688
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,134
so you can just raise your
wrist and say, hey, Siri,

1689
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:56,537
start a 30-minute
run in the park,

1690
01:27:56,538 --> 01:27:59,608
and it will start the Workout
app and get it going for you.

1691
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:03,208
You can also say things like
"go for a 300-calorie bike ride"

1692
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:06,511
or "go for a 5-mile run, "
and it will start the workout

1693
01:28:06,515 --> 01:28:08,555
for you without having to
touch the watch at all.

1694
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,120
When you achieve something,

1695
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,718
there are some beautiful new
achievements you will see

1696
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,191
that look like this.

1697
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:15,959
They spin right in, they're
beautiful, you can play

1698
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,827
with them in 3D on the
Watch, they are engraved

1699
01:28:17,826 --> 01:28:20,966
on the back now with your
name, and you can share these

1700
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:24,062
with people over Messages,
Facebook, or Twitter.

1701
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:28,605
Really cool Health &
Fitness.

1702
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:31,943
[Applause]

1703
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,440
With Apple Pay, you saw some

1704
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,141
of the great new
support we are bringing

1705
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,643
for store cards and
rewards cards.

1706
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:38,215
We are supporting
that in the Watch,

1707
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:40,813
so you can select a store card
and use it right in your Watch

1708
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,955
in a merchant terminal
just by waving it

1709
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:44,081
at the store stand there.

1710
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:46,955
And with Wallet coming to Watch,

1711
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,695
all of your rewards cards
will be right there,

1712
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,660
and you can also use those
right from your Watch

1713
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,499
as you are doing purchases.

1714
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,794
With Transit, we are
supporting, of course,

1715
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:57,596
the mass transit capabilities
in Maps now, so you will be able

1716
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:59,469
to see the transit
lines on your wrist.

1717
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:01,107
You can actually see
the departure times

1718
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,702
for different stations
you are near.

1719
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:05,404
When you are navigating, you
will get step-by-step directions

1720
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:08,407
about getting through the
different mass transit you use.

1721
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,580
With Siri, we are continuing
to add new domains for Siri.

1722
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,780
In watchOS 2, we
are enabling Siri

1723
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:16,182
to get you mass transit
directions, like bus directions

1724
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,954
to the Ferry Building,
which will look like this

1725
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:19,653
and you can just
start navigating.

1726
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:22,394
Or you can control things
in your home with Siri,

1727
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,090
you can say things like "hey
Siri set the dinner scene,"

1728
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,563
and it will talk to any
HomeKit-enabled devices

1729
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:30,532
in your house and set the
lights just how you want them.

1730
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,832
Isn't that cool?

1731
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,674
It's going to be great.

1732
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:38,209
[Applause]

1733
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,376
Another great thing is you
can actually ask for any

1734
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,015
of the Glances you have,
so you can say "hey, Siri,

1735
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:45,181
show me the Instagram
Glance," and it will show

1736
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,510
up right on your Watch face.

1737
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:49,014
This could be a glance you
don't have currently selected.

1738
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:50,887
It's a great way
to show information

1739
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:54,455
from third-party apps
right there in Siri.

1740
01:29:54,456 --> 01:29:55,886
So those are just
some of the highlights

1741
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,330
of what's coming in watchOS 2.

1742
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:58,325
We think it's going
to be a really,

1743
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:01,426
really great update
to the Watch.

1744
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:02,699
Now, that's not all.

1745
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:06,637
[Applause]

1746
01:30:06,635 --> 01:30:09,935
We also, of course, focused on
what we can do for developers,

1747
01:30:09,938 --> 01:30:12,908
and already, out of the gate
on day one, you can build apps

1748
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,207
for Apple Watch using
something called WatchKit,

1749
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:19,150
and that has enabled many
thousands of apps now

1750
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:22,387
to be created for Apple Watch,
and these apps today function

1751
01:30:22,384 --> 01:30:24,024
by relying on your phone.

1752
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:26,159
So you might have, for
example, an app on your Watch

1753
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,254
and the user interface
runs on your phone

1754
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,896
and the user interface is on
your Watch, but all the logic

1755
01:30:30,892 --> 01:30:33,332
for your app today
runs on your phone.

1756
01:30:33,328 --> 01:30:35,968
With native apps, you will
be able to move that logic

1757
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:38,664
to the watch so both the
UI and the logic are there,

1758
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:41,307
it will all run locally,
performance will be great,

1759
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:42,673
responsiveness will be great,

1760
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,041
it's going to be a great new
frontier for apps on Apple Watch

1761
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,740
with native app support.

1762
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:53,211
[Applause]

1763
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:56,114
When you are actually wandering
away from your phone sometimes,

1764
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,687
your apps will be able
to communicate directly

1765
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:59,726
with the network with
known Wi-Fi networks,

1766
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:01,691
so you can get the information
you want wherever you are

1767
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,760
with your Watch.

1768
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:07,928
[Applause]

1769
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:10,069
So we heard from you as we
were working on native apps,

1770
01:31:10,065 --> 01:31:11,865
a lot of feature requests
of things you would

1771
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,006
like to do on the Watch.

1772
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:15,001
These are a bunch of the
things that we've heard.

1773
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:16,473
So we've been listening to that.

1774
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,071
Let's go through
some of the things

1775
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:20,243
that will be possible
now in watchOS 2.

1776
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,641
You can see how we did on this.

1777
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,083
So one of the things we
heard was really wanted

1778
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:26,619
to access the microphone
on the Watch.

1779
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,414
So yes, in watchOS 2, you can
access the microphone right

1780
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:32,787
on the Watch and bring that
audio right into your app.

1781
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:35,827
[Applause]

1782
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,264
We also heard you want to
play audio out of the speaker.

1783
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,399
You can do that.

1784
01:31:39,394 --> 01:31:40,934
WatchOS 2 with native
apps, you can play back

1785
01:31:40,929 --> 01:31:43,499
through the Watch speaker
or you can play audio

1786
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,568
to a Bluetooth headset
or speaker connected,

1787
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:47,937
both short-form and
long-form audio.

1788
01:31:47,936 --> 01:31:49,706
Video. We know you
wanted to play video.

1789
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:52,104
You can play back short-form
video right on the Watch face.

1790
01:31:52,107 --> 01:31:55,147
It looks beautiful
on the Watch display.

1791
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:56,743
Access to HealthKit.

1792
01:31:56,745 --> 01:31:58,075
We definitely heard that.

1793
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,779
You now will have access,
native HealthKit on the watch,

1794
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:03,482
including streaming heart rate
data, so if you are doing,

1795
01:32:03,485 --> 01:32:05,285
for example, a bike
ride with Strava,

1796
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:08,826
you can see what heart rate zone
you are in while you are biking.

1797
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:14,193
[Applause]

1798
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:16,865
HomeKit is natively on the Watch
so you will be able to talk

1799
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:19,365
to your HomeKit devices from
your Watch and control them.

1800
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,837
We think this is going
to be a great future

1801
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,105
for control right
from your wrist.

1802
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:24,873
You will be able to
access the Accelerometer

1803
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,373
so you can get movement data.

1804
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,314
So for example, from the iPING
golf app here, you can check

1805
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,010
out your golf swing tempo

1806
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:34,682
as you are swinging the golf
club with your Watch on.

1807
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:37,822
Taptic Engine is one of the
things we've really done a lot

1808
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:40,489
of focused work on to make it a
great experience on the wrist.

1809
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:43,028
We are bringing access to
the Taptic Engine for you

1810
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:44,494
for your app development.

1811
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:47,062
You will be able to choose from
a range of different feelings

1812
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,431
as well as audio that
will come out the speaker.

1813
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:51,771
So for example, if I am
unlocking my car here,

1814
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,866
I will get feedback on my
wrist, both audio and felt.

1815
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:57,639
Just like that.

1816
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:00,679
Another great interaction on the
Watch is using the Digital Crown

1817
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:04,015
to manipulate the UI, and we are
enabling access to Digital Crown

1818
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:05,182
as well with watchOS 2.

1819
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,120
You will be able to
control custom UI element

1820
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:09,816
like changing the
temperature here just

1821
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:11,818
by rotating the Crown like this.

1822
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:14,890
Super easy way to
interact with your Watch.

1823
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:20,129
[Applause]

1824
01:33:20,128 --> 01:33:22,128
So we've done a great job
bringing a lot of access

1825
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:23,570
to the Watch now
with native apps.

1826
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:26,905
I would like to show you a
demo now with some examples.

1827
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:31,541
[Applause]

1828
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:34,479
So I've got a Watch here,
and I am going to put it on.

1829
01:33:34,476 --> 01:33:37,776
It's connected to the display
here through this little cable.

1830
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,549
All right.

1831
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:43,857
Let's start by looking at
three examples of new features

1832
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:46,792
in watchOS 2, then I
will show you three apps.

1833
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,888
Let's start with
making a photo face,

1834
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:52,990
so I will press my Digital Crown
here, go to the Home screen.

1835
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,124
There's my Photos.

1836
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,898
You can see I've got a
bunch of photos on here.

1837
01:33:56,898 --> 01:33:59,338
I can zoom in with
the Crown, pan around,

1838
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:00,534
and I can pick a photo

1839
01:34:00,535 --> 01:34:03,035
that might make a nice
Watch face like that one.

1840
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:04,507
I want to zoom in and
crop it a little more.

1841
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:06,876
I am going to zoom in a
little more, move it over like

1842
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,175
that to get it just right.

1843
01:34:08,176 --> 01:34:10,246
I think that's going to
make a great Watch face,

1844
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:13,845
so I just Force Touch,
choose Create Watch Face,

1845
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:15,948
and there you go, a
beautiful new Watch face.

1846
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:21,390
[Applause]

1847
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,319
Let's look at Time Travel.

1848
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,023
I will go over to
my modular face,

1849
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,525
got some more information here.

1850
01:34:25,527 --> 01:34:27,297
I have flight times
here on United.

1851
01:34:27,295 --> 01:34:28,595
I can see the temperature,

1852
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:31,866
my VW car's charge
level, and time in London.

1853
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:35,236
So I just rotate the Crown
here, I can go forward in time.

1854
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:36,506
Time is updating.

1855
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,744
My flight is leaving,
you can see, at 1:45.

1856
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:41,710
I wonder if my charge level will
be enough to get to the airport.

1857
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:45,249
So if I keep going forward in
time here, we will get to 1:45,

1858
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,316
and you can see my charge
level is just going to be great

1859
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:48,785
to get to the airport.

1860
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:50,823
In fact, you can keep going
and look at boarding time

1861
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:52,058
and arrival time
for your flight.

1862
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,093
So you can get a great
preview of your day just

1863
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:56,088
by rotating the Crown
right on the Watch face.

1864
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,430
It's a lot of fun.

1865
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:01,066
Just press the Crown
and go back to Home.

1866
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:04,562
If you get an email, you can
reply to email now in watchOS 2.

1867
01:35:04,566 --> 01:35:08,236
Here is an email that's
just come in from Marc.

1868
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:10,806
I can reply to this by pressing
the button right below the

1869
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:13,245
message, or you can
use Siri to reply

1870
01:35:13,241 --> 01:35:15,681
to a message right
from a notification.

1871
01:35:15,677 --> 01:35:20,687
If I just use Siri here,
I can reply like this.

1872
01:35:20,682 --> 01:35:28,692
Reply: I would love to.

1873
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:30,830
So Siri is making
the message there.

1874
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:32,165
It's created a response.

1875
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,000
I just press Send, and
it now goes off to Marc.

1876
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,966
So just by pressing the
Crown, you can use Siri

1877
01:35:36,965 --> 01:35:39,435
to send a message
right from your wrist.

1878
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:41,274
Now, let's look at a
few third-party apps.

1879
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:44,269
Let's look at the VW app you
saw on slides a second ago.

1880
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:46,442
I will show you how that works.

1881
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:49,081
Here it is.

1882
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:50,477
Now, I can lock my car just

1883
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:52,178
by pressing this
control right here.

1884
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:54,150
It responds right away.

1885
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:55,818
You can see the app also
opened very quickly.

1886
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:57,657
And I can control
the temperature here

1887
01:35:57,652 --> 01:36:00,192
that we were looking at before
by just rotating the Crown.

1888
01:36:00,188 --> 01:36:02,128
You can see how responsive
it is as I go up and down

1889
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:02,893
through temperatures here.

1890
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,260
Really, really cool.

1891
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:06,158
I will get it nice and warm for
me so when I get down there,

1892
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,500
it will be nice and toasty.

1893
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:08,495
Okay. Turn it on.

1894
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:10,566
All right.

1895
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:12,635
I've got confirmation
that it actually enabled

1896
01:36:12,634 --> 01:36:14,204
that on my car now.

1897
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:16,972
Access to the mic is going
to be really helpful in apps,

1898
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:18,941
and some of the apps that will
really benefit are communication

1899
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,310
apps like We Chat.

1900
01:36:20,308 --> 01:36:23,508
A lot of messages sent via
WeChat are audio messages,

1901
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:26,751
so let's see how that
will work with watchOS 2.

1902
01:36:26,748 --> 01:36:29,248
I have a message from Becky.

1903
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:32,220
I can reply by pressing
the Reply button,

1904
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,790
and you can see I've
got a microphone now

1905
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,528
so I can do an audio response.

1906
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:37,893
Let's do that.

1907
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:41,197
That sounds great.

1908
01:36:41,195 --> 01:36:44,595
You can see as I was recording
it, it got the audio levels

1909
01:36:44,599 --> 01:36:47,169
of my voice and now
it sent that to Becky.

1910
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:48,868
I can also reply
with stickers here.

1911
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,910
There's different
categories of them.

1912
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:54,305
With the Digital Crown now
being able to connect to the UI,

1913
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:57,748
I can flip through recent
stickers, pick one quickly

1914
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:00,445
that I like, and just
send that one as well.

1915
01:37:00,448 --> 01:37:02,118
So very fast to interact now

1916
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:05,386
with all these new controls you
have available in watchOS 2.

1917
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:07,926
Now, let's look at
the Vine glance.

1918
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:11,992
Vine is a great example of
playing back video on the Watch,

1919
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:15,363
and its format is really
perfect for the Watch face.

1920
01:37:15,363 --> 01:37:18,403
Here is a recent one on Vine.

1921
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,177
So that's video playing back
right on the Watch face.

1922
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:30,816
So those are just some
examples of what you can do now

1923
01:37:30,812 --> 01:37:32,982
with watchOS 2, and
I am super excited

1924
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:35,150
to see what all you guys
do with all this stuff.

1925
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:43,629
[Applause]

1926
01:37:43,624 --> 01:37:45,094
So some great new
enhancements coming,

1927
01:37:45,093 --> 01:37:48,293
as well as some super powerful
app development tools for you.

1928
01:37:48,296 --> 01:37:50,196
And we've been working
really hard on this,

1929
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:53,068
and I am really happy to say
that this stuff is all available

1930
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:56,167
to you today to start
building these native apps.

1931
01:37:56,170 --> 01:38:00,370
[Applause]

1932
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:02,674
Just six weeks from our
launch, it's unbelievable.

1933
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:06,017
Then it will be available
in the fall to everyone,

1934
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:07,583
and we will work
across all the watches,

1935
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:10,082
of course, and it will be free.

1936
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:11,754
So this has been
a great adventure.

1937
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:13,753
We are just getting
started here,

1938
01:38:13,755 --> 01:38:15,895
and I am really looking forward
to the journey ahead with all

1939
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,230
of you on Apple Watch.

1940
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:18,025
Thank you very much.

1941
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:19,065
Back to Tim.

1942
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,430
[Applause]

1943
01:38:21,429 --> 01:38:22,229
Thank you, Tim.

1944
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:26,230
&gt; TIM COOK: Thanks,
Kevin.

1945
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:28,834
We're really excited to have
Apple Watch out in the world,

1946
01:38:28,836 --> 01:38:32,906
and we can't wait to see
what you do with watchOS.

1947
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:36,777
And we couldn't be more
excited about how developers

1948
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:41,448
and users will use the powerful
ecosystems of both products

1949
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:46,959
and platforms, three
amazing platforms.

1950
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:50,994
The opportunities
really are limitless.

1951
01:38:50,992 --> 01:39:00,072
Now, before we close this
morning, we do have ...

1952
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:02,232
one more thing.

1953
01:39:02,236 --> 01:39:08,746
[Cheers and applause]

1954
01:39:08,743 --> 01:39:11,343
I'd like to tell
you about something

1955
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:13,545
that we've been working
really hard on

1956
01:39:13,548 --> 01:39:17,048
and something we are
super excited about.

1957
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:22,021
You know, we love music, and
music is such an important part

1958
01:39:22,023 --> 01:39:26,093
of our lives and our culture.

1959
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:30,433
We've had a long relationship
with music at Apple,

1960
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:34,071
and music has had a very
rich history of change,

1961
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,808
some of which we've
played a part in.

1962
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:40,544
We've made a great video
about the history of music,

1963
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:44,211
and I would like to play
it for you this morning.

1964
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:59,364
[Music]

1965
01:41:17,872 --> 01:41:23,482
[Cheers and applause]

1966
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:26,517
TIM COOK: Today we're
announcing Apple Music,

1967
01:41:26,514 --> 01:41:31,114
the next chapter in music, and
I know you are going to love it.

1968
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:35,688
It will change the way that
you experience music forever.

1969
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:40,030
To tell you more about it,
I'd like to bring up someone

1970
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:42,067
who knows more about music

1971
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:46,263
and the music experience
than anyone I know.

1972
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:50,837
He's worked with amazing
artists from Bruce Springsteen

1973
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:54,338
to John Lennon and
countless others.

1974
01:41:54,342 --> 01:41:58,512
We are thrilled to have him
a part of the Apple team.

1975
01:41:58,512 --> 01:42:00,952
Please join me in
welcoming Jimmy Iovine.

1976
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,418
Jimmy.

1977
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:10,956
[Cheers and applause]

1978
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,658
JIMMY IOVINE:
Thanks, Tim.

1979
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:15,060
Well, it's really
an honor to be here.

1980
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:17,102
I'm here because in 2003,

1981
01:42:17,098 --> 01:42:20,998
the record industry was
a ball of confusion.

1982
01:42:21,002 --> 01:42:26,342
We had Napster, we had
LimeWire, we had BitTorrent.

1983
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:30,750
This giant invader from
the north, technology.

1984
01:42:30,745 --> 01:42:34,445
I'm looking at my guys saying,
well, what do we do with this?

1985
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:37,718
So I go up to Apple, and I
see Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue,

1986
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:42,958
and they showed me something
brilliant and groundbreaking,

1987
01:42:42,957 --> 01:42:49,767
a simple, elegant way to
buy music online, iTunes.

1988
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:54,204
I'm like, wow, the ads are real.

1989
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:57,401
These guys really
do think different.

1990
01:42:57,405 --> 01:43:04,115
[Laughter] So they could help
move culture the same way

1991
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:06,711
that art moves culture.

1992
01:43:06,714 --> 01:43:13,954
Technology and art can work
together, at least at Apple.

1993
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:20,724
So now 2015, music industry
is a fragmented mess.

1994
01:43:20,728 --> 01:43:24,468
If you want to stream
music, you can go over here.

1995
01:43:24,465 --> 01:43:28,205
If you want to stream
some video,

1996
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:30,742
you can check some
of these places out.

1997
01:43:30,738 --> 01:43:32,708
If you want to follow
some artist,

1998
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:37,116
there's more confusion for that.

1999
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:42,121
So I reached out to Tim Cook
and Eddy Cue, and I said guys,

2000
01:43:42,116 --> 01:43:48,456
can we build a bigger and better
ecosystem with the elegance

2001
01:43:48,456 --> 01:43:52,756
and simplicity that
only Apple can do?

2002
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:57,700
One complete thought
around music.

2003
01:43:57,698 --> 01:44:01,298
And from that, I'm
standing here today so proud

2004
01:44:01,302 --> 01:44:05,042
of everyone that's worked
so hard, and I am going

2005
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:08,539
to introduce you to Apple Music.

2006
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:13,082
[Applause]

2007
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,180
Music has such
power in our lives.

2008
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:16,882
The way we listen to

2009
01:44:16,884 --> 01:44:21,454
and experience music is
undergoing a profound change

2010
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:22,655
these days.

2011
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:24,056
To have access to nearly
all the music in the world

2012
01:44:24,058 --> 01:44:27,098
at our fingertips and in
our pockets is remarkable.

2013
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:29,834
And yet there needs
to be a place

2014
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:32,000
where music can be treated
less like digital bits

2015
01:44:31,999 --> 01:44:34,099
and more like the art it is,

2016
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:37,871
with a sense of respect
and discovery.

2017
01:44:37,872 --> 01:44:39,612
And if that place could
actually accommodate

2018
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:41,647
and support the artists
who make the music,

2019
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:43,182
not just the top-tier artists,

2020
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:46,617
but the kids in their
bedrooms too, provide them all

2021
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:49,684
with a home and a way to
engage with their audiences,

2022
01:44:49,683 --> 01:44:52,123
that would be pretty great.

2023
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,589
And that's what we set out
to do with Apple Music.

2024
01:44:54,588 --> 01:45:00,358
[Music]

2025
01:45:00,361 --> 01:45:03,401
On Apple Music, all the
ways you love music can now

2026
01:45:03,397 --> 01:45:05,297
live together.

2027
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:08,039
Stream from the millions
of songs on iTunes any time

2028
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:11,075
and on demand, along with
hand-picked playlists,

2029
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,411
recommendations,
and all that's great

2030
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:16,177
and breaking in music right now.

2031
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:20,777
And broadcasting every day is
Apple's first 24/7 worldwide

2032
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:24,881
radio station, live
in over 100 countries,

2033
01:45:24,885 --> 01:45:27,655
Beats 1 is anchored
by Zane Lowe in LA.

2034
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:29,925
Ero Dodden in New York.

2035
01:45:29,924 --> 01:45:32,364
New York City
worldwide, this is Beats 1.

2036
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:34,159
And me, Julie out of
London.

2037
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:38,361
We cannot wait to play you
guys music we've got lined up.

2038
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:42,435
And at the heart of Apple
Music, there's Connect,

2039
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:45,736
where artists can share
with fans like never before.

2040
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:48,809
Songs, remixes, demos,
mix tapes, photos,

2041
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:52,009
videos, lyrics, soundbites.

2042
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:56,182
Really, any way an artist
chooses to express themselves.

2043
01:45:57,284 --> 01:45:58,884
TRENT REZNOR:
For fans,

2044
01:45:58,886 --> 01:46:00,726
we tried to create a
complete experience,

2045
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:03,461
by combining the catalog
of the world's music

2046
01:46:03,457 --> 01:46:05,457
with the music that's
not in that catalog yet,

2047
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,659
direct from the artist to you

2048
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:09,201
in a shared experience
with Beats 1.

2049
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:12,936
For the artists, we've built
an ecosystem we hope can start

2050
01:46:12,933 --> 01:46:16,733
to provide the tools to grow,
nurture, and sustain careers.

2051
01:46:16,737 --> 01:46:21,677
One place, one complete
thought around music.

2052
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:26,185
[Music]

2053
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,210
[Cheers and applause]

2054
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,314
JIMMY IOVINE:
Thank you.

2055
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:35,494
That's Apple Music and
the great Trent Reznor.

2056
01:46:35,489 --> 01:46:38,429
It's all the ways you love
music all in one place.

2057
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:42,095
And that place is
almost in a billion hands

2058
01:46:42,096 --> 01:46:43,796
around the world already.

2059
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:49,807
One app, one single
app on your iPhone.

2060
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:52,403
Apple Music is three things.

2061
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:57,416
It's a revolutionary
music service.

2062
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:02,051
Oh. A revolutionary
music service curated

2063
01:47:02,049 --> 01:47:06,689
by the leading music experts
who we helped hand-pick.

2064
01:47:06,687 --> 01:47:08,557
These people are
going to help you

2065
01:47:08,555 --> 01:47:10,895
with the most difficult
question in music.

2066
01:47:10,891 --> 01:47:15,131
When you are listening to a
playlist, what song comes next?

2067
01:47:15,129 --> 01:47:17,729
The only song that's
as important

2068
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:19,471
as the one you are
listening to at

2069
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:22,506
that moment is the
one that follows it.

2070
01:47:22,503 --> 01:47:23,973
Now, picture this.

2071
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:29,381
You are in a special moment.

2072
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:33,816
You're exercising or some
other special moment.

2073
01:47:33,814 --> 01:47:34,984
[Laughter] Right, Dre?

2074
01:47:34,982 --> 01:47:38,152
He exercises a lot.

2075
01:47:38,152 --> 01:47:40,752
And your heart's pumping.

2076
01:47:40,754 --> 01:47:42,924
And you are about
to turn up the reps.

2077
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:46,793
And the next song
comes on, ehhh!

2078
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:48,024
Buzz kill.

2079
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:50,968
You may ask why that happened.

2080
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:53,804
It happened because it
was probably programmed

2081
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:56,171
by an algorithm alone.

2082
01:47:56,170 --> 01:48:00,270
Algorithms alone can't
do that emotional task.

2083
01:48:00,274 --> 01:48:03,244
You need a human touch, and
that's why at Apple Music,

2084
01:48:03,243 --> 01:48:06,043
we want to give you the right
song, the right playlist,

2085
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:09,316
at the right moment,
all on demand.

2086
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:16,926
Now, the first-ever live
24-hour worldwide radio station,

2087
01:48:16,924 --> 01:48:20,464
so Trent Reznor calls
me up and says I got it.

2088
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:22,431
This is what we're going to do.

2089
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:27,739
Let's build the first-ever
worldwide live radio station

2090
01:48:27,735 --> 01:48:32,205
broadcast from three cities
that plays music not based

2091
01:48:32,206 --> 01:48:39,346
on research, not based on
genre, not based on drum beats,

2092
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:45,386
only music that is
great and feels great.

2093
01:48:45,386 --> 01:48:50,696
A station that has only
one master, music itself.

2094
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:54,731
So I said why do artists
always have the greatest ideas

2095
01:48:54,728 --> 01:48:58,868
that are practically
impossible to execute?

2096
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,666
So I said, well, wait a second.

2097
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:03,468
That's why we are at Apple.

2098
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:07,140
We are at Apple to help
artists' dreams be realized.

2099
01:49:07,141 --> 01:49:13,911
So we built the station, and
it's a music lover's dream.

2100
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:17,854
If you love great music without
any restrictions, you are going

2101
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:21,921
to love Apple Music's Beats 1.

2102
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:26,292
Finally, Connect, a fantastic
way for established and new

2103
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:29,633
and even unsigned artists
to connect directly

2104
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:32,600
with music lovers anywhere.

2105
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:35,799
This is going to be very
powerful for musicians.

2106
01:49:35,803 --> 01:49:38,443
Can you imagine being
an up-and-coming artist

2107
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:41,779
and being able to
share your music

2108
01:49:41,775 --> 01:49:44,245
on the biggest music
platform on the world

2109
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:48,814
that people already
have, Apple Music?

2110
01:49:48,816 --> 01:49:51,686
Remember, this is an ecosystem.

2111
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:53,925
It's built to fit together.

2112
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:56,221
It feeds off each other.

2113
01:49:56,223 --> 01:49:57,793
When you upload your music

2114
01:49:57,791 --> 01:50:02,561
to Apple Music, anything
can happen.

2115
01:50:02,563 --> 01:50:05,963
So now let me leave
the real heavy lifting

2116
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:08,336
to my great friend, Eddy Cue,

2117
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:10,905
and tell you how this
all works together.

2118
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:18,544
[Cheers and applause]

2119
01:50:18,545 --> 01:50:20,215
EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Jimmy.

2120
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:22,614
It's great to be here
this morning with you.

2121
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,956
So Apple Music, it's a
revolutionary music service,

2122
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,453
and it starts with My Music.

2123
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:30,795
We've added some great new
features from iTunes like the

2124
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:35,361
Up Next queue, and also
your recently added albums

2125
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:36,962
and songs right across the top.

2126
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:39,334
And all of the music
you've purchased,

2127
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:41,973
along with the playlists
you've created on your Mac

2128
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:44,869
or your iPhone, are right here.

2129
01:50:44,872 --> 01:50:47,572
Now, of course, you can
search your music library,

2130
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:50,974
but now you can search and
stream the millions and millions

2131
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:54,748
of songs that we have on iTunes.

2132
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:58,688
Now, in addition to My Music,
when you can stream and listen

2133
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:02,385
to any song you want, you
need a great place to start,

2134
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:05,689
and that's why we've
created For You.

2135
01:51:05,692 --> 01:51:08,292
For You recommends
playlists and albums

2136
01:51:08,295 --> 01:51:10,495
that we think you
are going to love.

2137
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:12,497
They are personalized
to your taste based

2138
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:15,399
on the music you listen
to, the artists you love.

2139
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:19,802
And it isn't just algorithms.

2140
01:51:19,806 --> 01:51:23,606
It's recommendations made by
real people who love music,

2141
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:26,450
and they are our
team of experts.

2142
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:28,046
Now, let's take a look at New.

2143
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:31,518
Here you will discover new
artists and albums every week,

2144
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:35,118
along with the top charts, and
every one of our playlists,

2145
01:51:35,122 --> 01:51:41,062
all human-curated, available
by genre or by activity.

2146
01:51:41,061 --> 01:51:43,801
So when you think
of Apple Music,

2147
01:51:43,797 --> 01:51:48,197
it's My Music, For You and New.

2148
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:50,001
It makes it fun and easy

2149
01:51:50,003 --> 01:51:53,703
to experience the catalog
of the world's music.

2150
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:56,677
And that is the revolutionary
music service.

2151
01:51:56,677 --> 01:51:58,877
Now let's talk about Radio.

2152
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:02,579
The truth is Internet
radio isn't really radio.

2153
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:04,213
It's just a playlist of songs.

2154
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:07,557
And so we wanted to do
something really big.

2155
01:52:07,554 --> 01:52:11,524
We wanted to create a worldwide
live radio station broadcasting

2156
01:52:11,525 --> 01:52:15,725
around the globe, and we've
done that with Beats 1.

2157
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:18,729
It's the world's best radio
station now meets the world's

2158
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:22,972
best voice, and that's
why we've hired Zane Lowe.

2159
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:27,170
Zane is a masterful interviewer
and an influential music figure

2160
01:52:27,174 --> 01:52:31,744
in his own right, and to tell
you more about it, here is Zane.

2161
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:36,185
ZANE LOWE: I am a
music fan.

2162
01:52:36,183 --> 01:52:38,023
I play records.

2163
01:52:38,018 --> 01:52:40,558
What I love is watching
a group of people react

2164
01:52:40,554 --> 01:52:43,524
to a great record
for the first time.

2165
01:52:43,523 --> 01:52:46,463
When I play that record on the
radio, the audience tell me,

2166
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,960
the time lines light up,

2167
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:50,601
my friends tell me,
my phone lights up.

2168
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:53,097
They love it or they hate it.

2169
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,970
But it creates a debate.

2170
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:58,108
That's what good music
on the radio does.

2171
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:00,805
When Apple first asked me to be
involved in this, they told us

2172
01:53:00,807 --> 01:53:04,807
to put the great music in front
of the average, the unexpected,

2173
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:08,811
the undiscovered, the
anticipated, the underrated.

2174
01:53:08,815 --> 01:53:10,955
Their words: Move the needle.

2175
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,251
And that's what we are doing.

2176
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:16,153
We have real music fans
running this place.

2177
01:53:16,156 --> 01:53:19,656
We have great music DJs and
incredible artists who are

2178
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:22,900
in the studio right now
building real radio shows

2179
01:53:22,896 --> 01:53:24,596
that are going to
blow your mind.

2180
01:53:24,598 --> 01:53:28,398
And the only place that can
pull off an imaginative idea

2181
01:53:28,402 --> 01:53:30,542
as big as this -- Apple.

2182
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,577
We are called Beats 1.

2183
01:53:32,572 --> 01:53:38,242
We are always on, playing
the music that we love.

2184
01:53:38,245 --> 01:53:42,385
[Applause]

2185
01:53:42,382 --> 01:53:44,182
EDDY CUE: So
Beats 1.

2186
01:53:44,184 --> 01:53:48,024
It is worldwide, it is live,
it is broadcasting 24 by 7,

2187
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:50,091
and it is coming
from New York, LA,

2188
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:54,030
and London, and that is Radio.

2189
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:57,327
Next, we wanted to find a
way to bring fans closer

2190
01:53:57,330 --> 01:54:00,100
to the artists they love,
and we call it Connect.

2191
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:05,640
It's a place where artists are
free to upload their music,

2192
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:11,109
their videos, their photos,
all directly to a fan.

2193
01:54:11,111 --> 01:54:15,251
Let's take Pharrell, a favorite
musician and songwriter of mine.

2194
01:54:15,248 --> 01:54:18,818
He is prolific, and
he does a lot.

2195
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:21,089
Let me show you how
it works with Connect.

2196
01:54:21,088 --> 01:54:23,158
He takes a lot of photos.

2197
01:54:23,156 --> 01:54:25,326
He writes a lot of lyrics.

2198
01:54:25,325 --> 01:54:28,495
He's experimenting and
mixing songs all the time.

2199
01:54:28,495 --> 01:54:32,135
Or he just has something
new and interesting to say.

2200
01:54:32,132 --> 01:54:35,602
All of this lives
right in Connect.

2201
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:39,942
Artists can post and
publish and upload anything,

2202
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:43,410
including directly to Facebook,
Twitter, and their own website,

2203
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:48,420
and fans can like and
comment on those posts.

2204
01:54:48,415 --> 01:54:51,455
And it's not just for one
artist, but it's for all

2205
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:53,451
of the artists that you love.

2206
01:54:53,453 --> 01:54:55,423
And to give you a
little sense of what it's

2207
01:54:55,422 --> 01:54:58,522
like to be an artist on Connect,

2208
01:54:58,525 --> 01:55:02,195
I'd like to invite
up a friend, Drake.

2209
01:55:02,195 --> 01:55:11,275
[Cheers and applause]

2210
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:18,610
DRAKE:
Thank you.

2211
01:55:18,612 --> 01:55:25,022
I want to say, honestly, what an
honor it is to be in this room

2212
01:55:25,018 --> 01:55:27,458
with so many individuals
that have changed the way

2213
01:55:27,454 --> 01:55:29,124
in which the world
relates to technology,

2214
01:55:29,122 --> 01:55:31,222
so give yourselves a
round of applause, please.

2215
01:55:31,224 --> 01:55:35,764
[Applause]

2216
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:41,172
For example, I bought this
vintage Apple employee's jacket

2217
01:55:41,168 --> 01:55:44,908
using a tool known in the
rap world as the Internet.

2218
01:55:44,905 --> 01:55:47,505
It's going to be huge this year.

2219
01:55:47,507 --> 01:55:48,847
It's out of this world.

2220
01:55:48,842 --> 01:55:50,982
He is excited, he knows about
it, that guy right there.

2221
01:55:50,977 --> 01:55:53,977
[Laughter] Honestly, in all
seriousness, I came here today

2222
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:58,080
to share my story, about the
way technology changed what I do

2223
01:55:58,084 --> 01:55:58,854
for a living.

2224
01:55:58,852 --> 01:56:02,252
I am from Toronto, Canada.

2225
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:06,765
[Cheers and applause]

2226
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:09,100
[Laughter]

2227
01:56:09,095 --> 01:56:12,495
You know, as a kid growing up,
I always wondered if my city

2228
01:56:12,499 --> 01:56:16,399
or even my country would
have somebody break

2229
01:56:16,403 --> 01:56:19,343
into the global music
scene as a true superstar.

2230
01:56:19,339 --> 01:56:23,739
You know, the dream seemed
unattainable at the time.

2231
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:26,543
Even myself, I tried to
do it the traditional way,

2232
01:56:26,546 --> 01:56:31,486
the towering New York label
buildings, the lobby littered

2233
01:56:31,484 --> 01:56:34,884
with other people's
accomplishments.

2234
01:56:34,888 --> 01:56:37,728
It's improbable to think that
every talented artist is going

2235
01:56:37,724 --> 01:56:40,464
to get a shot to have
their vision validated.

2236
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:45,000
And then that's when
the game changed.

2237
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:47,598
And we had to change it.

2238
01:56:47,601 --> 01:56:52,541
Myself and my team
brought our vision

2239
01:56:52,539 --> 01:56:54,939
and our music directly
to the people.

2240
01:56:54,941 --> 01:57:02,851
And that was kind of the first
time that we really got noticed.

2241
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:08,589
The dream of being a new artist
like myself five years ago

2242
01:57:08,588 --> 01:57:11,488
and connecting directly with
an audience has never been more

2243
01:57:11,491 --> 01:57:14,461
close and reachable
than right now.

2244
01:57:14,461 --> 01:57:19,871
See, now we encourage you to
spend the time on your body

2245
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:24,436
of work, spend the time on your
craft, assemble the right body

2246
01:57:24,437 --> 01:57:26,807
of work, and instead of
having to post your stuff

2247
01:57:26,806 --> 01:57:31,046
on all these different and
sometimes confusing places,

2248
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:33,444
it all lives in one very simple,

2249
01:57:33,446 --> 01:57:37,656
very easy place,
and that is Connect.

2250
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:40,221
It's right from where
you are in your city

2251
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,360
in front of your computer.

2252
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:45,225
And this approach is
how we broke in 2008,

2253
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:48,395
and it has been perfected
and simplified, of course,

2254
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:51,295
by the great people at Apple.

2255
01:57:51,298 --> 01:57:57,468
So you know, as I'm working
tirelessly on this next album,

2256
01:57:57,470 --> 01:57:59,540
this comes at the
perfect time for me.

2257
01:57:59,539 --> 01:58:05,379
Given the great success of my
last mix tape that went directly

2258
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:07,448
to iTunes, this really --

2259
01:58:07,447 --> 01:58:14,117
I can't wait to incorporate
Apple Music

2260
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,020
and especially Connect
into what I am doing next.

2261
01:58:16,022 --> 01:58:17,792
I am really excited about
what I am working on.

2262
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:21,661
And as an artist, I can say for
all those kids sitting at home,

2263
01:58:21,661 --> 01:58:26,201
it's truly amazing to be part
of something that I believe in,

2264
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:31,669
and this is something
that simplifies everything

2265
01:58:31,671 --> 01:58:34,311
for the modern musician
like myself

2266
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:37,307
and the modern music
consumer like you.

2267
01:58:37,310 --> 01:58:39,050
So I hope you enjoy Apple Music.

2268
01:58:39,045 --> 01:58:40,185
I hope you enjoy Connect.

2269
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:41,950
My name is Drake, and
thank you for your time.

2270
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,418
Appreciate it.

2271
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:50,526
[Cheers and applause]

2272
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:53,263
EDDY CUE: Thank you,
Drake.

2273
01:58:53,259 --> 01:58:54,929
And that is Connect.

2274
01:58:54,928 --> 01:58:58,568
Now, I'd love to give you
a demo of Apple Music,

2275
01:58:58,565 --> 01:59:00,765
but before I start, I do want

2276
01:59:00,767 --> 01:59:04,437
to wish Phil Schiller
a happy birthday.

2277
01:59:04,437 --> 01:59:13,517
[Cheers and applause]

2278
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:20,453
So let's go ahead and
launch our new Music app.

2279
01:59:20,453 --> 01:59:22,693
You will notice right away
it's got a brand-new UI,

2280
01:59:22,689 --> 01:59:24,129
much simpler to use.

2281
01:59:24,124 --> 01:59:26,764
Your recently added albums and
songs right across the top.

2282
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:30,460
Let's play this new
song from Spoon I added.

2283
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:34,133
[Music]

2284
01:59:34,134 --> 01:59:35,204
One of the things
you will notice,

2285
01:59:35,201 --> 01:59:37,001
we have a new mini
player across the bottom

2286
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:39,003
that always shows
you what's playing.

2287
01:59:39,005 --> 01:59:41,945
If I tap on it, I
get full screen,

2288
01:59:41,941 --> 01:59:44,011
and I can see the
beautiful artwork,

2289
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:45,450
all the playback controls.

2290
01:59:45,445 --> 01:59:51,615
I can just swipe down,
and it disappears.

2291
01:59:52,986 --> 01:59:55,586
Now, I like looking
at my music by artist.

2292
01:59:55,588 --> 01:59:56,728
It's really easy to do that too.

2293
01:59:56,723 --> 02:00:00,693
I will just tap on
Albums, switch to Artists,

2294
02:00:00,693 --> 02:00:02,293
and let's take a look
at Aretha Franklin.

2295
02:00:02,295 --> 02:00:05,335
The first thing you will notice
is we add beautiful artwork

2296
02:00:05,331 --> 02:00:07,331
to all the artist pages.

2297
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:09,603
Notice as I swipe
up, it goes away,

2298
02:00:09,602 --> 02:00:11,202
and you see Aretha at the top.

2299
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:15,444
No demo goes complete
without playing this song.

2300
02:00:16,509 --> 02:00:25,589
[Music]

2301
02:00:27,287 --> 02:00:30,627
Now, you not only get all of
your Aretha Franklin songs

2302
02:00:30,623 --> 02:00:33,563
in your music library, but
you can also tap on All,

2303
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,360
and now you can see all of
the songs on Apple Music,

2304
02:00:36,362 --> 02:00:39,802
including the latest
release, what the top song is,

2305
02:00:39,799 --> 02:00:42,769
what the top album is.

2306
02:00:42,769 --> 02:00:45,169
Now, it is hard to stop this
song, but I want to keep going.

2307
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:48,271
Now let's go back to my library,

2308
02:00:48,274 --> 02:00:50,914
and let's take a
look at my playlists.

2309
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:52,910
Now, despite the game last
night, I am getting ready

2310
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:54,882
for tomorrow night, and I
have already started creating

2311
02:00:54,881 --> 02:00:56,281
my playlist.

2312
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:58,052
One of the first things you will
notice is you can add your own

2313
02:00:58,051 --> 02:00:59,421
artwork to your playlist.

2314
02:00:59,419 --> 02:01:01,519
I am going to be
doing this tonight,

2315
02:01:01,521 --> 02:01:04,821
getting the Warriors
ready, but let's go back.

2316
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:09,994
It is karaoke night, and
these are some of the songs

2317
02:01:09,996 --> 02:01:12,596
that our team has to
look forward to tonight.

2318
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:14,139
Let's go ahead and play that.

2319
02:01:14,134 --> 02:01:16,204
[Music]

2320
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:17,572
Just imagine.

2321
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:22,080
[Music]

2322
02:01:22,075 --> 02:01:25,115
Now, if I tap on
the mini player,

2323
02:01:25,111 --> 02:01:27,181
I can see the full screen.

2324
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:30,120
If I tap on the right-hand side
next to the playback controls,

2325
02:01:30,116 --> 02:01:32,386
I can see the complete
playlist, and it's very easy

2326
02:01:32,385 --> 02:01:33,485
for me to reorganize it.

2327
02:01:33,486 --> 02:01:35,956
Let's say I want to
move Jealous back up,

2328
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:37,855
and now that will be the
next song that plays.

2329
02:01:37,857 --> 02:01:39,597
It's that simple.

2330
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:46,162
[Applause]

2331
02:01:46,166 --> 02:01:47,566
Now, that's great.

2332
02:01:47,567 --> 02:01:50,067
The first time we go to For You,
we want to find out a little bit

2333
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:51,969
about your musical
tastes, so we are going

2334
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,841
to ask you what genres you like.

2335
02:01:53,840 --> 02:02:01,750
I am a big fan of rock, pop,
hip-hop, and alternative.

2336
02:02:01,748 --> 02:02:06,248
And now it will ask me for
some artists that I like.

2337
02:02:06,252 --> 02:02:08,792
Well, I love Bruce Springsteen,
so I am going to tap twice.

2338
02:02:08,788 --> 02:02:13,528
I like Lorde, like
Alabama Shakes.

2339
02:02:13,526 --> 02:02:14,796
Now we are going to take all

2340
02:02:14,794 --> 02:02:17,394
of this information you've
provided, along with all

2341
02:02:17,397 --> 02:02:20,867
of your playlists and the songs
that you've purchased on iTunes,

2342
02:02:20,867 --> 02:02:23,737
and we are going to make
recommendations just for you.

2343
02:02:23,736 --> 02:02:27,036
So here is one inspired
by Bruce Springsteen.

2344
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,080
Here's one called
Bring the Big Rock.

2345
02:02:29,075 --> 02:02:30,645
Let's play that.

2346
02:02:30,643 --> 02:02:34,513
[Music]

2347
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:36,514
That's a great Foo
Fighters song.

2348
02:02:36,516 --> 02:02:40,356
I can just tap and see
the rest of the songs.

2349
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:42,493
Definitely going to
like this playlist.

2350
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:46,357
Now, here's another
one from Pharrell.

2351
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:48,999
I also get new albums
that are available to me,

2352
02:02:48,995 --> 02:02:51,335
and even some classic albums
that I should be listening to.

2353
02:02:51,331 --> 02:02:54,801
And so here are some
brand-new albums

2354
02:02:54,801 --> 02:02:56,941
from the artists
that I really love.

2355
02:02:56,936 --> 02:03:02,706
Now, here is an interesting
one, a Cuban playlist.

2356
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:04,179
You might be wondering
how did that get in there?

2357
02:03:04,177 --> 02:03:08,717
Well, I like a lot of Latin
music, so Apple Music knows that

2358
02:03:08,715 --> 02:03:10,185
and is recommending
this playlist to me.

2359
02:03:10,183 --> 02:03:12,753
Let's take a look at it.

2360
02:03:13,686 --> 02:03:20,556
[Music]

2361
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,700
Definitely gets my
Cuban blood going.

2362
02:03:22,695 --> 02:03:27,735
[Music]

2363
02:03:27,734 --> 02:03:30,904
Now, this is a playlist I
definitely want to keep,

2364
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:33,743
so I am going to tap on the
plus sign, and I've added

2365
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:35,410
that now to my playlist.

2366
02:03:35,408 --> 02:03:41,418
Now, let's take a
look at what's new.

2367
02:03:41,414 --> 02:03:44,654
You can see new albums
across the top.

2368
02:03:44,651 --> 02:03:46,991
More here, and even the
hot singles that are out.

2369
02:03:46,986 --> 02:03:50,726
Let's play this one from
Florence and the Machine.

2370
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:59,803
[Music]

2371
02:04:01,734 --> 02:04:07,574
I can keep scrolling and
see some recent releases.

2372
02:04:07,573 --> 02:04:10,813
But of course, everyone loves
the charts, so let's go ahead

2373
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:15,210
and take a look at the
charts, see the top songs.

2374
02:04:15,214 --> 02:04:16,154
The top albums.

2375
02:04:16,149 --> 02:04:18,389
And even the top music videos.

2376
02:04:18,384 --> 02:04:22,484
We have tens of thousands of
music videos in HD, all ad-free.

2377
02:04:22,488 --> 02:04:25,358
Let's take a look at this
one from Mark Ronson.

2378
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:36,840
[Music]

2379
02:04:57,490 --> 02:05:00,290
I've got to work on some of
those moves for next year.

2380
02:05:01,627 --> 02:05:03,127
[Laughter] Now, sometimes
you just want to sit back

2381
02:05:03,129 --> 02:05:06,629
and let someone else be your
DJ, so let's go to Radio.

2382
02:05:06,632 --> 02:05:08,232
And to give you a little taste

2383
02:05:08,234 --> 02:05:11,004
of what Beats 1 is
going to sound like ...

2384
02:05:14,741 --> 02:05:15,511

Beats 1.

2385
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:16,778
Welcome our special guest,

2386
02:05:16,776 --> 02:05:18,346
Florence from Florence
and the Machine.

2387
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:21,944
On paper, it sounds like
super, not how you think a rock

2388
02:05:21,948 --> 02:05:23,718
and roll album would be made.

2389
02:05:23,716 --> 02:05:25,256
Was that you in
your sweatpants?

2390
02:05:25,251 --> 02:05:29,391
That was me in an anorak
cycling to the studio.

2391
02:05:29,389 --> 02:05:31,729
We are looking for the
most exciting music and people

2392
02:05:31,724 --> 02:05:33,964
that love it in all
corners of the globe,

2393
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:35,960
broadcasting to 100 countries.

2394
02:05:35,962 --> 02:05:39,262
That shared experience
just got so much bigger.

2395
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:41,130
&gt
 LA.

2396
02:05:41,134 --> 02:05:43,074
&gt; New York
City.

2397
02:05:43,069 --> 02:05:44,039

London.

2398
02:05:44,036 --> 02:05:44,976
EDDY CUE: That's
really awesome.

2399
02:05:44,971 --> 02:05:46,201
Let's take a look at Connect

2400
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:49,575
and see what my favorite
artists are up to.

2401
02:05:49,575 --> 02:05:52,715
Here's Pharrell and some
behind-the-scenes footage.

2402
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:53,682
Here is Chris Cornell.

2403
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:55,579
This is an interesting one.

2404
02:05:55,581 --> 02:05:58,521
He has posted lyrics of a new
song that's coming out before,

2405
02:05:58,518 --> 02:06:00,688
obviously, he's even
recorded it.

2406
02:06:00,686 --> 02:06:02,486
Here's Bastille.

2407
02:06:02,488 --> 02:06:05,358
They are working on
their next album.

2408
02:06:05,358 --> 02:06:07,858
Let's see what they have to say.

2409
02:06:08,995 --> 02:06:10,965
Mark is just through
here, and we are working

2410
02:06:10,963 --> 02:06:13,803
on a song called Blame, which
some of you might have heard

2411
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:16,540
at festivals or gigs before,

2412
02:06:16,536 --> 02:06:19,706
but we're really excited to
have finally recorded it.

2413
02:06:19,705 --> 02:06:21,345
It's a song about gangsters.

2414
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,580
And yeah, this is the riff,

2415
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:25,875
which we already
have sounding great.

2416
02:06:25,878 --> 02:06:32,348
[Music]

2417
02:06:32,351 --> 02:06:34,291
EDDY CUE: It's great to be
able to get behind the scenes

2418
02:06:34,287 --> 02:06:37,087
and see what the process that
an artist uses to create a song.

2419
02:06:37,089 --> 02:06:40,529
As we keep going
down, here's a shot

2420
02:06:40,526 --> 02:06:43,396
from Alabama Shakes
a couple nights ago.

2421
02:06:43,396 --> 02:06:46,766
And here is a studio session,
actually, at Capital Studio A.

2422
02:06:46,766 --> 02:06:48,606
Those of you who know,
Capitol Studio is one

2423
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:51,141
of the premier studios,
historical,

2424
02:06:51,137 --> 02:06:53,907
and Alabama Shakes was just
there a couple nights ago.

2425
02:06:53,906 --> 02:07:02,986
[Music]

2426
02:07:18,064 --> 02:07:19,334
EDDY CUE: Again,
be able

2427
02:07:19,332 --> 02:07:22,632
to see things you've never
been able to hear or see.

2428
02:07:22,635 --> 02:07:25,835
Loren Kramar, you probably
have never heard of him.

2429
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:29,208
He is an unsigned artist, I
just started following him.

2430
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:31,848
He has posted a new song
right up on Connect,

2431
02:07:31,844 --> 02:07:33,544
and I would love to play it now.

2432
02:07:33,546 --> 02:07:36,946
First time anyone's heard it.

2433
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:43,489
[Music]

2434
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:44,659
Just imagine you
are a new artist,

2435
02:07:44,657 --> 02:07:46,657
and look at all the
people who have been able

2436
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:48,959
to hear this song right
now thanks to Connect.

2437
02:07:48,961 --> 02:07:58,041
[Music]

2438
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:05,040
So Loren Kramar.

2439
02:08:05,044 --> 02:08:06,344
Remember that name.

2440
02:08:06,345 --> 02:08:09,215
We think he is going to
be really, really huge.

2441
02:08:09,215 --> 02:08:11,915
Now, of course, you can always
search for music across all

2442
02:08:11,918 --> 02:08:13,318
of our millions and
millions of songs.

2443
02:08:13,319 --> 02:08:15,859
I like to do a little
bit of stuff with Siri

2444
02:08:15,855 --> 02:08:19,495
because Siri has been learning
a lot more about music.

2445
02:08:19,492 --> 02:08:22,362
Play Born to Run.

2446
02:08:25,998 --> 02:08:35,078
[Music]

2447
02:08:36,876 --> 02:08:38,576
It's one of my favorite
songs of all time.

2448
02:08:38,578 --> 02:08:39,978
Let's get a little
more specific.

2449
02:08:39,979 --> 02:08:44,549
Play the top ten
songs in Alternative.

2450
02:08:47,019 --> 02:08:56,099
[Music]

2451
02:08:58,397 --> 02:09:01,437
If I tap on the Up Next
queue, I can see all

2452
02:09:01,434 --> 02:09:04,434
of the top ten songs
and what's next.

2453
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:11,640
Now, I feel like reminiscing
a little, and let's go back

2454
02:09:11,644 --> 02:09:15,114
to my high school
days when I graduated.

2455
02:09:15,114 --> 02:09:19,584
Play the top song from May 1982.

2456
02:09:22,054 --> 02:09:31,134
[Music]

2457
02:09:40,139 --> 02:09:41,839
Now, that brings back some
memories, but we will leave

2458
02:09:41,841 --> 02:09:43,211
that for another time.

2459
02:09:43,209 --> 02:09:47,579
Have you ever gone to a movie
and you love the soundtrack

2460
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:50,580
or the song that was on there,
but you don't know the name

2461
02:09:50,583 --> 02:09:52,023
or you have forgotten
about it later?

2462
02:09:52,018 --> 02:09:55,318
Well, it's really
easy with Siri.

2463
02:09:55,321 --> 02:09:58,091
Play the song from Selma.

2464
02:10:03,095 --> 02:10:07,435
[Music]

2465
02:10:07,433 --> 02:10:10,333
Let's do that again.

2466
02:10:10,336 --> 02:10:12,636
Play the song from Selma.

2467
02:10:16,108 --> 02:10:25,188
[Music]

2468
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:36,131
And that is Siri, and
that is Apple Music.

2469
02:10:36,128 --> 02:10:39,998
[Cheers and applause]

2470
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:42,639
It is a revolutionary
music service

2471
02:10:42,635 --> 02:10:44,405
with recommendations
just for you,

2472
02:10:44,403 --> 02:10:48,203
a worldwide live radio station
with the world's best DJs,

2473
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:51,547
an exciting way for fans
to connect with artists,

2474
02:10:51,544 --> 02:10:54,814
and of course, this is joined
by the iTunes Music Store,

2475
02:10:54,814 --> 02:10:56,954
the best place to buy music.

2476
02:10:56,949 --> 02:10:59,849
Apple Music is all of
the ways you love music,

2477
02:10:59,852 --> 02:11:01,152
all in one place.

2478
02:11:01,153 --> 02:11:04,923
We are launching in over a
hundred countries later this

2479
02:11:04,924 --> 02:11:10,094
month with iOS 8.4 for your
iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad,

2480
02:11:10,096 --> 02:11:13,296
as well as a new version
of iTunes for the Mac,

2481
02:11:13,299 --> 02:11:15,669
a new version of
iTunes for Windows,

2482
02:11:15,668 --> 02:11:18,168
and Android is coming this fall.

2483
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:22,140
[Cheers and applause]

2484
02:11:22,141 --> 02:11:26,341
Apple Music will be just $9.99
a month, the cost of an album.

2485
02:11:26,345 --> 02:11:28,285
We want everyone to try it,

2486
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:31,180
so we are making the
first three months free.

2487
02:11:31,183 --> 02:11:37,623
[Applause]

2488
02:11:37,623 --> 02:11:40,563
Now, we want to do something
really great for families.

2489
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:42,799
Today you have to buy
a music subscription

2490
02:11:42,795 --> 02:11:44,995
for each and every person.

2491
02:11:44,997 --> 02:11:47,597
Or you share an account even
though you are not supposed to.

2492
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:51,100
And now all of you can't
play at the same time,

2493
02:11:51,103 --> 02:11:52,143
and your playlists

2494
02:11:52,138 --> 02:11:54,508
and recommendations
get all messed up.

2495
02:11:54,507 --> 02:11:59,447
Well, with Apple Music, for
just $14.99, you can have

2496
02:11:59,445 --> 02:12:01,215
up to six family members.

2497

[Applause]

2498
02:12:08,888 --> 02:12:11,488
Everyone gets their own
account, their own library,

02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:13,190
their own recommendations.

2500
02:12:13,192 --> 02:12:15,732
It's an incredible value.

2501
02:12:15,728 --> 02:12:17,398
And that is Apple Music.

2502
02:12:17,396 --> 02:12:18,066
Thank you.

2503
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:20,033
Turn it back to Tim.

Thanks, Eddy.

2506
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:26,810
Isn't that amazing?

2507
02:12:28,908 --> 02:12:32,648
We really love Apple Music,
and we hope that you do too.

2508
02:12:32,645 --> 02:12:34,145
And we are so excited about it,

2509
02:12:34,146 --> 02:12:37,216
and with all the countries
we are rolling out to,

2510
02:12:37,216 --> 02:12:40,756
we made a great ad to
tell the world about it.

2511
02:12:40,753 --> 02:12:43,223
And I'd love to run
it for you now.

This is Zane Lowe of
Beats 1.

2513
02:12:48,894 --> 02:12:50,994

2517
02:13:55,294 --> 02:13:57,534
Now, music connects with us all
at such a deep, emotional level.

2518
02:13:57,529 --> 02:14:00,799
We couldn't be happier
to launch Apple Music,

2519
02:14:00,799 --> 02:14:02,799
and we can't wait till
you start listening to it

2520
02:14:02,801 --> 02:14:04,371
at the end of the month.

2521
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:06,970
This has been a jam-packed
morning.

2522
02:14:06,972 --> 02:14:10,272
I hope you've enjoyed
it as much as we have.

2523
02:14:10,276 --> 02:14:12,046
We want to thank
everybody for joining us,

2524
02:14:12,044 --> 02:14:17,354
especially the developers,
and I'd like to recognize all

2525
02:14:17,349 --> 02:14:21,659
of the people in Apple, all
of our team that have worked

2526
02:14:21,654 --> 02:14:24,954
so hard on making
and creating all

2527
02:14:24,957 --> 02:14:26,727
of these products
you've seen this morning.

2528
02:14:26,725 --> 02:14:28,365
Thank you, guys.

2529
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:36,370
[Applause]

2530
02:14:36,368 --> 02:14:40,138
It is an incredible privilege
of a lifetime to work with them.

2531
02:14:40,139 --> 02:14:43,439
Now, I've got one last thing.

2532
02:14:43,442 --> 02:14:48,552
Before we go, it's only
fitting to celebrate the launch

2533
02:14:48,547 --> 02:14:54,387
of Apple Music with an
incredible music performance

2534
02:14:54,386 --> 02:14:57,926
by one of the hottest new
artists in music today,

2535
02:14:57,923 --> 02:15:03,033
and it's not only a hot
new artist, but he's going

2536
02:15:03,028 --> 02:15:08,668
to do a worldwide premiere of
his newest song this morning.

2537
02:15:08,667 --> 02:15:11,407
Please give it up
for The Weeknd.
