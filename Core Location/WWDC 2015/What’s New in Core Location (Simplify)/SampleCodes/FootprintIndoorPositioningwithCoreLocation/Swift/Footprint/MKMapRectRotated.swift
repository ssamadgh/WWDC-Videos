    Abstract:
    In order to properly clamp the MKMapView (see
                VisibleMapRegionDelegate) to inside a floorplan (that may not be
                "North up", and therefore may not be aligned with the standard
                MKMapRect coordinate frames),
                we'll need a way to store and quickly compute whether a specific
                MKMapPoint is inside your floorplan or not, and the displacement to
                the nearest edge of the floorplan.
    
                Since all PDF bounding boxes are still PDFs, after all, in the case
                of this sample code we need only represent a "rotated" MKMapRect.
                If you have transparency in your PDF or need something fancier,
                consider an MKPolygon and some combination of CGPathContainsPoint()

    We'd love to have that simplicity too, so our underlying main strategy is to
    simplify the problem.

    If we can answer the following two questions:
        1. how far away are you, from the rectangle, in the height direction?
        2. how far away are you, from the rectangle, in the width direction?

    Then we can use these values to take the exact same (simple) approach!
