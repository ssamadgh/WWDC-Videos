1
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:07,536
>> Good afternoon.


2
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:09,476
My name is Gregory Hughes and


3
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:10,795
I'm really excited to have the


4
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:12,116
opportunity to speak to you


5
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,246
today about a super important


6
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:15,256
and interesting topic.


7
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,206
The accessibility of media and


8
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:17,786
games.


9
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:21,466
At Apple, we strive to surprise


10
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,246
and delight all of our customers


11
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,816
regardless of their abilities


12
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:25,886
and disabilities.


13
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:29,556
We envision a world where users


14
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,026
like Patrick are able to do what


15
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,846
they love and love what they do,


16
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,346
without being hindered by


17
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:35,116
technology.


18
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,096
We want to make sure that users


19
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,376
with disabilities can experience


20
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,326
the same surprise, delight,


21
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:42,496
magic moments and most


22
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,346
importantly fun when using our


23
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:45,116
devices.


24
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:47,796
As part of that vision, your


25
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,086
apps play a key role.


26
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,066
You play such an important part


27
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,786
in helping us to deliver an


28
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,796
inclusive, accessible and fun


29
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:56,656
platform for all of our users.


30
00:02:58,186 --> 00:02:59,456
During our conversations today,


31
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,626
we're going to be talking about


32
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:02,936
four categories of disabilities.


33
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,616
Visual disabilities, which are


34
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,206
those pertaining to sight.


35
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,256
How much a user can see, in some


36
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,166
cases, the users that can't see.


37
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,126
Motor disabilities, which are


38
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,296
disabilities pertaining to how a


39
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,606
user interacts physically with


40
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:17,046
the device, whether they can


41
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,616
hold the device at all, how to


42
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,056
use a keyboard or mouse.


43
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:23,096
Hearing disabilities, which are


44
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,546
those pertaining to how much


45
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,186
somebody can hear and in some


46
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,856
cases the complete inability to


47
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:28,216
hear.


48
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:31,036
And lastly, disabilities related


49
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:31,786
to cognition.


50
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,736
And these are displays that


51
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:35,246
affect how somebody thinks when


52
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,006
using your game.


53
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,906
How much they can remember from


54
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:38,966
the original instructions you


55
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:39,496
gave them.


56
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,016
Or what type of UI works best


57
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:42,446
for them.


58
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:44,496
So, while talking about these


59
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:45,826
disabilities, today we're going


60
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,856
to break everything down into


61
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,096
three key sections.


62
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,386
First, I'm going to present how


63
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:53,106
to make your media and videos


64
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,116
more accessible in your


65
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:54,976
applications.


66
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,236
We'll then build on some of


67
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,696
those topics and talk about how


68
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:00,946
to make your games more


69
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:01,436
accessible.


70
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:02,746
How do you think about


71
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,176
accessible design in gaming.


72
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,676
And this is really interesting.


73
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:07,316
As we talk about this, it's


74
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,336
really easy to sit back and say,


75
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:10,676
"My game can't be made


76
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:11,316
accessible."


77
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:13,266
And one thought experiment that


78
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,866
we often go through is let's


79
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:16,935
start from a point where we


80
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,266
think it can be done.


81
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:20,366
Let's assume that somebody


82
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,166
that's blind can use my video


83
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,956
editing app, or somebody with


84
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:25,386
cerebral palsy can play my


85
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:26,606
first-person shooter game.


86
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,636
The challenge and the fun part


87
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:29,916
is then figuring out how that


88
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,506
can be done.


89
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:33,246
And so, try to keep that in mind


90
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,256
as we're going through some of


91
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,086
these specific cases and general


92
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,976
cases for adding accessibility


93
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:38,866
to your games.


94
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,086
And then last, we're going to


95
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:42,366
show a demo game that we made,


96
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:44,266
that highlights some of these


97
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,156
accessible design concepts.


98
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:48,086
And we'll give you some ideas on


99
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:49,556
how you can implement them in


100
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,646
your own app.


101
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,876
So, first, the accessibility of


102
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,796
media and video.


103
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:56,676
And generally, the most


104
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:57,756
straightforward one that people


105
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,216
think about is the accessibility


106
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,016
of images.


107
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:01,376
And anyone that's worked in


108
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,426
accessible design will always


109
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,476
say, always add alt text.


110
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,426
But it's not quite that simple


111
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:08,226
in all cases.


112
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,066
For example, if we take a look


113
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:11,356
at this image on the screen.


114
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,046
You might describe this as


115
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:15,716
"Woman sitting in a hammock


116
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:16,866
playing a guitar."


117
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,596
An equally good description


118
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:22,306
might be "Person playing guitar


119
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,836
with custom artwork drawn using


120
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:24,376
a marker."


121
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:26,786
Equally, you could describe this


122
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,026
as "Image demonstrating the use


123
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:31,086
of the camera's aperture to make


124
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,066
the foreground blurry while


125
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,656
keeping the subject in focus."


126
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,446
So, the important part when


127
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:36,866
trying to describe your images,


128
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,996
trying to populate that alt


129
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:39,836
text, is thinking about how this


130
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:40,776
image is used in your


131
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:41,336
application.


132
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,166
What's the context for the image


133
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,276
and what's it conveying to the


134
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:44,746
user?


135
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,096
Once you can think about that,


136
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:48,326
you can then create a really


137
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:49,776
good, clear and concise


138
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,226
description for users that might


139
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,546
not be able to see the image.


140
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:55,206
So, for images we always want


141
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:56,896
developers to think about clear,


142
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:59,096
concise descriptions that convey


143
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:00,066
the same information that


144
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,336
somebody, that a sighted user


145
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,726
market get.


146
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:06,706
For audio, we're generally


147
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:07,866
thinking about disabilities


148
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:08,876
pertaining to hearing.


149
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:10,286
How does somebody that can't


150
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,676
hear, or has difficulty hearing


151
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:13,816
perceive the audio in your


152
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:14,476
application?


153
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:17,846
For audio, there are generally


154
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,396
two categories of audio that we


155
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:20,666
see in apps.


156
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:22,366
The first is spoken audio.


157
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,256
And this could be something like


158
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:26,596
a recording of the "I Have a


159
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,446
Dream" speech.


160
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,066
Or it could be a podcast that


161
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,246
you play back in your app.


162
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:32,976
But regardless, when dealing


163
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,196
with spoken audio you want to


164
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,746
think about in the context of


165
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:37,356
your application how can you


166
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,646
provide somebody that can't hear


167
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:40,486
that spoken audio access to the


168
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:41,426
same information.


169
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:43,456
So, this is generally some way


170
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:44,776
of providing a transcript.


171
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:46,876
This could be a popup that shows


172
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:47,706
up in your app to show a


173
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:48,336
transcript.


174
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:49,686
In the case of many great


175
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:51,086
podcasts, they have online


176
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:52,416
transcripts that somebody who's


177
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,046
deaf could go and read to get


178
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,826
the same contextual information


179
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:57,376
that is conveyed in the podcase.


180
00:06:58,176 --> 00:06:59,906
So, it really how and why you're


181
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:01,256
using this spoken information


182
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,936
for how you're going to adapt it


183
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:04,366
to somebody that can't access it


184
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,176
through hearing.


185
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:07,826
The next way that audio is used


186
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:10,166
in apps are for sound effects or


187
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:11,956
ways to convey information.


188
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:15,116
So, for example, in a game, you


189
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,956
might convey where an enemy is


190
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:18,616
by audio on the left side or the


191
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:19,526
right side of the user.


192
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,776
And in these cases, you want to


193
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,226
think about how can you provide


194
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,066
that same information either


195
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:26,556
through visual or haptic


196
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:27,626
feedback to the user.


197
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:29,836
So, again it's thinking about if


198
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:31,316
somebody can't hear this audio,


199
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:32,406
which is really easy to


200
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,626
simulate, you can just mute your


201
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,566
device, how can we convey the


202
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,106
same information in our game or


203
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,526
application to such a user.


204
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,776
So, for audio, we are always


205
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:44,936
thinking about how to convey the


206
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,596
same information, what is an


207
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:47,886
alternative way of conveying


208
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:48,116
that.


209
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:51,946
The last part of media and video


210
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,826
is thinking about video, which


211
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:56,936
is kind of the combination of


212
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:58,196
images and audio.


213
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:00,616
So, if you're not familiar,


214
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,316
video has three key tracks,


215
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,546
sometimes called media groups.


216
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:06,716
The first is a visual track.


217
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,046
This is kind of the moving


218
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:09,156
pictures that we see.


219
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,956
The next is the audible track.


220
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,146
This is the track that contains


221
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:14,016
all the sound, the sound


222
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,486
effects, the spoken dialogue.


223
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,756
And last is what's called the


224
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:19,736
legible track.


225
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:21,036
And this one most people are


226
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:21,656
familiar with.


227
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,506
I know most people are familiar


228
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:25,146
with it because we intro'd this


229
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:27,056
with a closed-captioned video.


230
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,506
But you've probably also seen


231
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:29,946
closed captions in the gym or


232
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:30,636
the airport.


233
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:32,796
And legible tracks can be more


234
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:33,966
than just closed captions.


235
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,556
They can also be subtitles for


236
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,726
users that don't understand the


237
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:37,256
language.


238
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,515
They could also be closed


239
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,186
captions as I said, but another


240
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,145
term for closed captions is SDH,


241
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,436
or subtitles for the deaf and


242
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:46,126
hard of hearing.


243
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,856
Subtitles for the deaf and hard


244
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,106
of hearing are different than


245
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:51,636
normal subtitles and subtitles


246
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:52,406
for translation.


247
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,286
Subtitles for the deaf and hard


248
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,086
of hearing can include lots more


249
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,446
information about the content.


250
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:58,826
So, they might include things


251
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,336
like what song is playing.


252
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,416
Was there a loud crash in the


253
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,156
other room, or in some cases,


254
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:05,456
even the absence of sound.


255
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,376
So, it will just say silence if


256
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,196
that's important to


257
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,336
understanding what's happening.


258
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:10,916
So, again it's taking a step


259
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,476
back and thinking about if I


260
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:13,746
didn't have the ability to hear


261
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,586
this video, what information


262
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:17,496
needs to be conveyed to such a


263
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:17,886
user.


264
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:19,766
And so, for the most part, this


265
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,056
is, you're playing back videos,


266
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,146
it's working with your content


267
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,706
providers and making sure


268
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,286
they're aware that you want a


269
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:26,686
closed-captioned track created.


270
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:28,666
And in some cases, a subtitle


271
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:28,946
track.


272
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,436
But it's always thinking about


273
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,646
closed captions and thinking


274
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:33,096
about users with hearing


275
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,216
impairments and providing


276
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:34,906
information.


277
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,326
Playing this back is really


278
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,386
simple in your apps.


279
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:41,386
If you're using AVKit, on iOS or


280
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:42,916
macOS, you don't have to do


281
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,386
anything.


282
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,616
As long as your content creator


283
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:45,906
put the track in the video, it


284
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:47,206
will playback appropriately,


285
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:48,656
based on the user's settings.


286
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:51,316
If you're working a little bit


287
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:53,456
lower level at AVFoundation, you


288
00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:54,526
will need to do a little bit of


289
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,296
work to let a user select which


290
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:57,716
captioning track they want to


291
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,116
see.


292
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,946
So, if you're the lower level as


293
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:03,136
I said at the AVFoundation


294
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,406
level, you will need to first


295
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,996
get all of the media group for


296
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:09,216
the legible tracks again, we


297
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:11,026
said closed captioned subtitles


298
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,286
are the legible tracks.


299
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,606
You'll then need to do a little


300
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,626
bit of pruning, because this can


301
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:16,816
be a really big list.


302
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,686
And you want to exclude forced


303
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,286
subtitles and auxiliary


304
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:22,566
subtitles from that list.


305
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,186
Then you' have a final list of


306
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:26,376
all of the tracks that should be


307
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,746
displayed to a user and you'll


308
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:29,176
iterate over them and just add


309
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:30,826
them to some kind of menuing, or


310
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:31,916
some kind of other UI that


311
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,066
you're displaying to a user.


312
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,026
If you're working even lower


313
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:38,696
level than AVFoundation, if


314
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,196
you're taking responsibility for


315
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,236
drawing your own video,


316
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:42,726
rendering each frame, playing


317
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,546
back your audio, you'll also


318
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:45,576
then be responsible for


319
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:48,386
rendering captioning content.


320
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:50,026
And depending on what content


321
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,336
you're playing, there can also


322
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:53,686
be legal regulations that you


323
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,656
have to honor, system settings


324
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,906
for the user has for how they


325
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,096
want closed captions to be


326
00:10:59,096 --> 00:10:59,636
displayed.


327
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:01,736
In order to do this, we have a


328
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:02,976
great framework called Media


329
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:03,686
Accessibility.


330
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,486
And this allows you to get all


331
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:07,086
of those user options for things


332
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:08,326
like foreground color,


333
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,086
background color, font size,


334
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,936
font choice and other things


335
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:13,856
along those lines.


336
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:15,336
So, that you can render captions


337
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,266
the way they look everywhere


338
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,076
else in the system.


339
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,986
That's where most people stop,


340
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:19,576
right?


341
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,226
Most people are aware of closed


342
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:22,276
captions, they work with their


343
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:23,116
content creators.


344
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:24,546
Make sure they add a captioning


345
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:24,936
track.


346
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:28,906
And it's easy to overlook the


347
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:29,966
audible track.


348
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:32,616
It's easy to say, for somebody


349
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:34,156
that can't see, there's already


350
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,356
audio there, we don't need to do


351
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:36,076
anything else.


352
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:37,676
But if you think about watching


353
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:40,056
your favorite movie, or a TV


354
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,286
show that you watch regularly.


355
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:42,706
If you couldn't see what's


356
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,536
happening, yes, there's audio


357
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:45,866
but in a lot of cases it doesn't


358
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:46,786
convey everything that's


359
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:47,286
happening.


360
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:49,826
So, there's a technology to


361
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,106
solve that and it's called Audio


362
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:51,886
Descriptions.


363
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:53,766
And this is a secondary audio


364
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:55,936
track the user can select that


365
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,806
contains not only all the normal


366
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:59,886
narration, not only all the


367
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,616
normal speech and sound effects,


368
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,196
but also narration for what's


369
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:03,696
happening.


370
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:05,956
Now most people have never


371
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:06,636
experienced this.


372
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:07,956
So, I want to play a short clip


373
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:09,606
of that intro video, that


374
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:11,226
includes the audio description


375
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:11,636
track.


376
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,816
[ Laughter ]


377
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,056
>> I have so much that I've


378
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:21,246
always wanted to express.


379
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:24,076
I'm like a volcano.


380
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,656
I'm like Pelee or Mount Etna.


381
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,416
>> Arm the track for recording.


382
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,676
>> I'm about ready to erupt.


383
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:33,026
>> He dances to a logic session


384
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:33,906
as titles appear.


385
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,786
Designed for Patrick L.


386
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:37,026
Designed for everyone.


387
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,966
An Apple logo appears.


388
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,386
>> So, as you can see, this


389
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,566
audio description track is


390
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,276
really important for somebody


391
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:49,436
that can't see the content.


392
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:51,846
And maybe not critical in this


393
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:53,376
short video clip, but it can be


394
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:54,356
really important when you're


395
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,756
watching a movie or a TV show to


396
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:56,796
understand what's happening.


397
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,486
And it's mixed correctly with


398
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,516
all of the other audio in the


399
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:00,896
video.


400
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,586
So, again the key part here just


401
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:03,926
like captions is working with


402
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,256
your content creators to make


403
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,096
sure, where appropriate these


404
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:08,516
audio description tracks are


405
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:09,816
created and rendered with the


406
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:10,256
video.


407
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,276
Playing them back, just like


408
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:13,806
captions you will get for free,


409
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,296
as long as you're using AVKit.


410
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,846
Again, just like captions if


411
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,286
you're working lower level than


412
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:20,926
AVKit, at the AVFoundation


413
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,386
level, you'll need to do a


414
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,656
little bit of work, and almost


415
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:24,346
the same work.


416
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:25,816
First you'll need to get the


417
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:27,676
media group for the audible


418
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,416
tracks.


419
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:30,656
Instead of pruning this time,


420
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,046
we're going to look for just the


421
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:32,436
track.


422
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,846
We're still pruning but instead


423
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,226
of excluding tracks this time,


424
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:36,316
we're going to get just the


425
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,916
primary audio tracks.


426
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,256
And we'll then iterate over


427
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:43,276
those to add them to a menu or


428
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,346
some other UI where the user can


429
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:47,236
select them.


430
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,196
So, for video we now have a


431
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,036
complete story.


432
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,216
We've thought about users who


433
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,026
are blind, users who are deaf


434
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:54,196
and how they interact with our


435
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:54,846
content.


436
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:58,036
And how they consume our videos.


437
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,586
So, we talked about images, make


438
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:04,226
sure you add a clear and concise


439
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:05,656
description to your images.


440
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:09,466
Audio, make sure that you're


441
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,906
adding an alternative way for


442
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,106
users to access the audio.


443
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,806
And video, make sure you're


444
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:14,826
working with your content


445
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:15,936
creators to create


446
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:17,366
closed-captioned tracks, audio


447
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,926
description tracks and that


448
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:19,956
application will support the


449
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,336
playback of these correctly.


450
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:23,726
Now, I'd like to hand it over to


451
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,206
my colleague Charlotte, who's


452
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:26,236
going to build on some of these


453
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:27,916
concepts and talk about how they


454
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,276
can be applied to games and how


455
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:30,386
you can make some extraordinary


456
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:31,946
games that are accessible to


457
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:33,086
users with disabilities.


458
00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:33,866
Thanks.


459
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:36,156
[ Applause ]


460
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,256
>> Thank you.


461
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:41,416
Thanks. I'm Charlotte Hill and


462
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,666
today I'm going to talk to you


463
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,186
about accessible games.


464
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:47,206
When you create a game, you want


465
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:48,246
to make something that your


466
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:49,696
users will get lost in.


467
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:50,926
You don't want them to get


468
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,266
pulled out of that experience


469
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:53,296
because of difficulties


470
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:54,536
interacting with your software.


471
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:56,236
Today I'm going to talk to you


472
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:57,966
about accessible games and how


473
00:14:57,966 --> 00:14:59,026
to make a game that's fun to


474
00:14:59,026 --> 00:14:59,896
play for everyone.


475
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:03,146
Earlier, we saw a video of


476
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,536
Patrick and how he uses


477
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,176
VoiceOver on his iPhone and his


478
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:06,376
Mac.


479
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:08,826
VoiceOver users like Patrick do


480
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,796
a lot of things with their


481
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,626
phones, including playing games.


482
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:13,216
When you're developing your


483
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,036
game, think about VoiceOver


484
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:16,366
users like Patrick with


485
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,546
different abilities and


486
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,036
disabilities and how they'll be


487
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:20,386
able to interact with your game.


488
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:23,646
Let's say I'm designing an app


489
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,106
based on the Four in a Row game.


490
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,536
This is a two-player game, where


491
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,166
each player takes turns dropping


492
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,326
colored tokens into slots on a


493
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:32,986
vertical 2D gameboard.


494
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:34,686
The goal is to get four of your


495
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:36,276
tokens in a line and block the


496
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,636
other player from doing so.


497
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,566
How can I design it to be


498
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,346
accessible from the ground up?


499
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,096
Today, we're going to talk about


500
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:45,036
how I can make my game


501
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:46,896
accessible thinking about four


502
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:49,326
areas of accessibility; vision,


503
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,546
motor, hearing, and cognition.


504
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,676
These cover huge spectrum of


505
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,306
abilities, but we'll focus on


506
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:57,206
some key points in each category


507
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,396
and how they relate to Four in a


508
00:15:58,396 --> 00:16:00,146
Row, and likely your game as


509
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:00,406
well.


510
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,906
First, let's think about vision.


511
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:06,666
In the context of our game, the


512
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,626
key areas we'll focus on are


513
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:11,386
color, motion, dynamic type, and


514
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:12,416
VoiceOver support.


515
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,686
One of the key visual elements


516
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:16,496
of this game is the


517
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:17,936
differentiation between the two


518
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:18,686
player's tokens.


519
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,056
Here, one player is green and


520
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:22,006
the other is red.


521
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,186
These colors can be really hard


522
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,426
to distinguish for someone who


523
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:26,956
is colorblind, or doesn't see


524
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:27,586
color at all.


525
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:30,286
Here's what the same colors may


526
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:31,476
look like to someone who has a


527
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:32,576
type of colorblindness.


528
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:36,356
Let's take a look at how some


529
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,846
other apps differentiate without


530
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:38,896
color in their games.


531
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:41,236
In Causality, the characters are


532
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:42,636
defined by the colors of the


533
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:43,906
stripes of their helmets.


534
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:45,536
So, take a look at their


535
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:48,226
helmets, and then this is what


536
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:49,406
it looks like in the colorblind


537
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:49,746
mode.


538
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:50,626
You can go back.


539
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:54,226
So, they've added these shapes


540
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:55,356
that go along with the colors to


541
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,916
help distinguish between the


542
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,436
characters in their color


543
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,386
colorblind friendly mode.


544
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,406
We can build off that idea and


545
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:04,736
use shapes as well as colors in


546
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:05,146
our game.


547
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:08,455
Now, let's talk about how we'll


548
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:09,896
use motion in our game.


549
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:11,556
And you may want to close your


550
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:12,786
eyes for a second if you get


551
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,056
motion sickness.


552
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:16,965
Okay, so this is the really cool


553
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,346
animation I wanted to do in the


554
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:19,445
background of my game.


555
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:21,215
Not at all distracting.


556
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:24,256
I think it will be a big hit.


557
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,425
OK you can open your eyes.


558
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,415
Some people experience motion


559
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:29,086
sicknesses from these kinds of


560
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:29,886
animations.


561
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,656
Motion sickness happens when


562
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:32,976
some of your senses tell you


563
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:34,556
you're moving, but others don't.


564
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:36,316
When you're using your phone,


565
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:37,996
your eyes see motion, but you


566
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:39,256
don't feel it in your muscles,


567
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:40,176
or your inner ear.


568
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,706
Motion sickness from computers


569
00:17:42,706 --> 00:17:44,006
is actually really common.


570
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:46,376
In one study, 70% of adults


571
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,676
reported motion sickness while


572
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:49,966
playing a game.


573
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,836
In my Four in a Row game, I'll


574
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:53,086
make another background with


575
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:54,896
less motion to follow the reduce


576
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,026
motion setting on iOS.


577
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:58,376
This doesn't have to be a static


578
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:01,006
image, just tighten up the


579
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,806
physics of the motion so there


580
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,006
is less motion overall.


581
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,926
You can find out more about


582
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:08,956
designing for reduce motion on


583
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,176
the WebKit blog.


584
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,806
Another accessibility setting to


585
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:14,376
design for is dynamic type.


586
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,476
Dynamic type or larger text


587
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,316
sizes for users with low vision


588
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:20,876
lets users go beyond the


589
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,526
standard text sizes to something


590
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:24,486
that's easier for them to read.


591
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:26,806
Your game should support the


592
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,466
standard text sizes as well as


593
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,046
an accessibility text sizes,


594
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:31,376
which go up to accessibility


595
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,206
extra, extra, extra-large.


596
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,456
We'll want to test set out our


597
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:36,656
game with some different text


598
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:37,926
sizes to make sure our layouts


599
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:40,186
accommodate them.


600
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:41,896
You can learn more about making


601
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,526
your app work with dynamic type


602
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:45,226
at the Dynamic Type Session and


603
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:45,976
Labs on Friday.


604
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:49,716
So, we've done a lot to make our


605
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:51,596
game more accessible for sighted


606
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,586
users with vision problems, but


607
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,906
what about low vision or blind


608
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:55,416
players.


609
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:57,576
A lot of players may be playing


610
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,246
your game using VoiceOver, the


611
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:00,586
screen reader that comes built


612
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,476
in on all your Apple devices and


613
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,056
let's players who are blind hear


614
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:05,296
everything that's on screen.


615
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:08,266
Here's an example of how


616
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:09,176
VoiceOver works.


617
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,076
On my phone, I'm going to swipe


618
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:12,906
across the screen to move the


619
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:13,866
different elements and hear


620
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,166
VoiceOver read them to me.


621
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,186
Then I'll tap on the screen and


622
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:18,426
hear what's under my finger, and


623
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:20,006
then I'll double tap to press an


624
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,696
element, in this case open an


625
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:21,846
app.


626
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:22,646
>> Dock, phone.


627
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:28,066
Phone.


628
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:30,876
>> So, when it's moving through


629
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:31,806
those elements you saw the


630
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:32,626
little square going.


631
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,006
It also says what it is.


632
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,616
And so, that way a VoiceOver


633
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:37,056
user can hear everything that's


634
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:37,806
on their screen.


635
00:19:38,356 --> 00:19:41,716
If you're using AppKit or UIKit


636
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:42,806
without a lot of custom


637
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,736
controls, your game should


638
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:45,986
already work pretty well with


639
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:46,666
VoiceOver.


640
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:48,716
If you do have custom controls


641
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:50,006
or images, you can use the


642
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:51,826
accessibility API to finish


643
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:54,566
making your app accessible.


644
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,256
For example, in my game I have


645
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,476
these tokens that are custom


646
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:57,886
views.


647
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,546
And I want VoiceOver to say the


648
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,676
right thing when it lands on


649
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:00,976
them.


650
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:02,636
Let's go with player A and


651
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:03,246
player B.


652
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:06,366
I can use these strings of the


653
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,146
accessibility label property to


654
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:09,686
label these elements.


655
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,386
Now, when VoiceOver lands on a


656
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:13,716
token it will say its name


657
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:14,316
properly.


658
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:15,826
And you can learn more about


659
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:16,856
that in the What's New in


660
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:18,346
Accessibility Talk that was just


661
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:19,396
on the screen before that.


662
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:20,266
It's going to be available


663
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,076
online and they went into some


664
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:23,206
more detail about using the


665
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:25,076
accessibility API.


666
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:28,536
So, for vision we thought about


667
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,186
three key points for our Four in


668
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:30,786
Row game.


669
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:32,986
First, we used shapes and


670
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:33,436
colors.


671
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:34,676
So, there's more than one type


672
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:36,026
of indicator for players who are


673
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:36,796
colorblind.


674
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,176
We provided alternate


675
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:40,836
experiences for reduced motion


676
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:41,726
and dynamic type.


677
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,226
And we made sure all of our


678
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,686
elements were accessible and


679
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:46,796
labeled for VoiceOver.


680
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:50,936
When you're designing a game for


681
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:52,996
iOS or macOS you're usually


682
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:54,316
thinking about players swiping


683
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:55,776
on a screen or typing on a


684
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:56,186
keyboard.


685
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,786
However, your players may be


686
00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:00,246
playing your game using


687
00:21:00,246 --> 00:21:01,856
assistive technologies like


688
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,516
Touch Accommodations, the


689
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:04,786
Accessibility Keyboard,


690
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,666
Alternative Inputs, and Switch


691
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,046
Control.


692
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:10,246
Some of your players might have


693
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,526
difficulties with fine motor


694
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:13,456
skills like from arthritis that


695
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,776
make it difficult for them to


696
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,356
accurately swipe and tap in your


697
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:17,776
game.


698
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,716
These players may use the Touch


699
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:21,296
Accommodations and Accessibility


700
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:22,856
Settings to make it easier for


701
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:23,836
them to interact with their


702
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:24,256
phone.


703
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:26,386
However, it's still a good idea


704
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,506
to think about how you can make


705
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:28,816
it easier to swipe and tap in


706
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:29,306
your game.


707
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:32,746
In my Four in a Row app, players


708
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:34,366
tap on a column to drop in their


709
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:35,016
token.


710
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:36,386
I want to make sure these


711
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,846
targets are large and clearly


712
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:40,336
defined, so it's easy for users


713
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:41,306
to hit them.


714
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:43,086
The Human Interface Guidelines


715
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:45,286
recommends a minimum area of 44


716
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:47,536
by 44 for topical elements.


717
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:50,386
If you're designing a game for


718
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:52,286
macOS, players might be using


719
00:21:52,286 --> 00:21:53,546
the Accessibility Keyboard to


720
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,246
play your game.


721
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:56,466
Instead of typing on a physical


722
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,076
keyboard, players use the


723
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,136
trackpad, mouse or dwell control


724
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:01,576
to select keys on screen.


725
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,266
Your game should just work with


726
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,776
the Accessibility Keyboard, but


727
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:06,006
you may have to provide some


728
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:07,066
options for keys.


729
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,416
If your game requires pressing


730
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,816
and releasing multiple keys at


731
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:13,166
the same time, offer an option


732
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,466
for just pressing a single key


733
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,446
instead, or allow a press and


734
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,026
hold so players can use sticky


735
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:18,366
keys.


736
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:21,526
You can hear more about the


737
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:22,816
Accessibility Keyboard in the


738
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:24,026
What's New in Accessibility


739
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:24,306
Talk.


740
00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:28,126
Other players may be playing


741
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,616
your game through alternative


742
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,316
external inputs like braille


743
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,236
displays, HID controllers, and


744
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:34,516
external keywords in iOS.


745
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:36,586
These are great options for


746
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:37,826
players who have difficulties in


747
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:39,306
motor skills, or repetitive


748
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:40,166
strain injuries.


749
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,636
Supporting keyboards for things


750
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:43,486
like typing could be


751
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,496
straightforward in your game,


752
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:45,856
but you may have to do a little


753
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:46,316
extra.


754
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:47,926
For example, in Four in a Row,


755
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,186
we needed to implement a


756
00:22:49,186 --> 00:22:50,896
selection mechanism for players


757
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:52,116
to be able to select a column


758
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,136
using a keyboard.


759
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:56,806
Other players might be playing


760
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:58,186
your game using Switch Control,


761
00:22:58,476 --> 00:22:59,636
an assistive technology


762
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,786
available on macOS, iOS and


763
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:02,236
tvOS.


764
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,356
Switch Control lets you control


765
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:05,546
your device with one or more


766
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:07,746
switches which are like buttons


767
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,226
that can be pressed by a hand, a


768
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:11,726
head, or another body part.


769
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:13,856
When you're using a single


770
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,846
switch, Switch Control scans all


771
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:17,806
items on screen and then you can


772
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,196
tap your switch when it lands on


773
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:19,906
the item you want.


774
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,806
So, here Switch Control is on


775
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:24,036
and it's scanning everything in


776
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,036
Sushi Go, and then when it lands


777
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,866
on my sushi, I tap my switch.


778
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:29,386
And I select my sushi.


779
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,916
So, the good news is that if you


780
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:32,736
already made your game


781
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:34,686
accessible using the accessibly


782
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:36,726
API for VoiceOver, which is used


783
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:38,256
by players who are blind, it


784
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:39,366
should also work with Switch


785
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:39,786
Control.


786
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:41,756
That means that games like Sushi


787
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:42,936
Go can be played with just a


788
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:43,726
single button.


789
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:47,726
In my Four in a Row app, I added


790
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,576
a cool erase gesture that clears


791
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:51,056
the board when a user swipes in


792
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:51,896
a zigzag.


793
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:54,416
However, this could be really


794
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,496
difficult for players who are


795
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:56,776
using Switch Control or Touch


796
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:57,596
Accommodations.


797
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,336
So, I'll put an option on my


798
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:01,076
settings to use buttons instead


799
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:02,736
of these gestures, so Switch


800
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:04,116
users can use that instead.


801
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:07,126
When designing for players with


802
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:08,576
difficulties of motor skills,


803
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:09,636
you want to make sure that your


804
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:11,386
targets are clearly defined and


805
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:12,646
easy to hit.


806
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,066
Try to provide for different


807
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,456
inputs in your game, like


808
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,556
testing it out with Switch


809
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,016
Control or HID controller.


810
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,686
Provide options for custom


811
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:24,116
gestures so your game is still


812
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:25,946
playable with a single switch.


813
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:30,006
Players in my game might be deaf


814
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,346
or hard of hearing and I want to


815
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,266
make sure they're not missing


816
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:33,776
out on any of the experience by


817
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:35,066
providing captions and alert


818
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:35,596
options.


819
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:39,656
In my Four in a Row game, I want


820
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:40,916
to have a single player mode


821
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,326
where the AI speaks taunting


822
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:43,616
remarks throughout the game to


823
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:44,986
increase the competition.


824
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:47,096
However, my players may be deaf


825
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:49,276
or hard of hearing.


826
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:50,726
Grim Fandango is a complex


827
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:51,966
adventure app with a lot of


828
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,416
dialogue, but it lets users pick


829
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,466
between just speech, just text,


830
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:58,256
and speech with text.


831
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:00,686
I'll use the techniques Greg


832
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:02,756
described earlier to add audio


833
00:25:03,406 --> 00:25:04,616
to my game.


834
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:05,886
Accessibility Settings let your


835
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:06,966
players customize the


836
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,206
environment to fit their needs.


837
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:10,346
In Grim Fandango, there's also


838
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:12,016
different sliders for adjusting


839
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:13,466
the different types of volume in


840
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:13,806
the game.


841
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:15,516
And this is a great option for


842
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:16,726
players who are hard of hearing,


843
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:18,216
because that way you can select


844
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:19,756
what you want your music volume


845
00:25:19,756 --> 00:25:21,236
to be versus what you want the


846
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:22,756
volume to be for any speech, for


847
00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:23,266
example.


848
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:25,596
Depending on your game, you


849
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:26,896
might also want to offer sound


850
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,506
effect options, so players with


851
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:29,896
hearing loss in one range can


852
00:25:30,306 --> 00:25:31,176
select sound that's in a


853
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:31,936
different range.


854
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:35,026
In my Four in a Row game, I want


855
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:36,086
to use sounds that fill the


856
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:37,706
spectrum, so more people can


857
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:38,256
hear them.


858
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:40,476
I also want my sound effects to


859
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:41,776
be really noticeable for all


860
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:42,196
players.


861
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:43,666
So, I'll combine them with


862
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,736
screen flashes or haptics on


863
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:46,796
supported devices.


864
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:50,766
Deaf or hard of hearing players


865
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,356
will enjoy your game a lot more


866
00:25:52,356 --> 00:25:53,906
if you provide captions for any


867
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:54,056
text.


868
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,476
Depending on your sound effects,


869
00:25:56,546 --> 00:25:57,626
you'll want to try to use full


870
00:25:57,626 --> 00:26:00,146
spectrum sounds, or add audio


871
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:01,686
options so players can select


872
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,366
what sounds work best for them.


873
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,646
Try using multiple ways of


874
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,336
getting player's attention, like


875
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:08,776
screen flashes or haptics.


876
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:10,686
Some of my players might have


877
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,346
cognitive and neurodevelopmental


878
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:16,056
disorders like ADHD, autism, or


879
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:16,506
dementia.


880
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:18,786
These cover a wide spectrum and


881
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:20,006
so it will be really helpful to


882
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:21,626
get feedback from my users about


883
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:22,876
what challenges they encountered


884
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:23,706
while playing Four in a Row.


885
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:25,986
However, there are some key


886
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:27,286
areas I can focus on while


887
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,146
developing my game, such as


888
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:30,686
options for audio and visuals,


889
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,676
providing help and tutorials,


890
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:35,216
supporting Guided Access, and


891
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:36,496
offering different game modes.


892
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:40,236
When we looked at Grim Fandango,


893
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:41,666
one great option was the


894
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,696
combination of voice and text.


895
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,226
This is a great option for


896
00:26:45,226 --> 00:26:46,756
players to comprehend better


897
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:48,516
when there's a mixture of sound


898
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:49,936
and visuals in the game.


899
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:51,556
I'll make sure to provide an


900
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:52,666
option like that in Four in a


901
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:52,966
Row.


902
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:56,236
Another thing I want to provide


903
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:57,846
in my game is easy access to the


904
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:58,666
instructions.


905
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:00,326
For players with attention or


906
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:01,726
memory problems, it can be


907
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:02,926
really difficult to remember


908
00:27:02,926 --> 00:27:04,386
instructions or rules they


909
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:05,306
encountered when they first


910
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:06,106
played the game.


911
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,876
Solivad [assumed spelling] has a


912
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,596
ton of versions of solitaire and


913
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:10,806
it can be hard to remember all


914
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,576
their nuances, but they all have


915
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:14,146
a rules button available from


916
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,226
the same screen where you play


917
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:15,626
the game.


918
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,606
I'll do the same thing in Four


919
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:18,816
in a Row, and add a button to


920
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:20,156
the game playing screen, so


921
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:21,176
players can get back to the


922
00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:21,496
rules.


923
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:24,536
Some of my players will want to


924
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:25,706
play my game through Guided


925
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:26,126
Access.


926
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:28,336
Guided Access offers players


927
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:29,736
another way to experience your


928
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:30,656
app.


929
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:32,186
A parent or caretaker can set up


930
00:27:32,186 --> 00:27:33,896
restrictions on the game so the


931
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:35,286
Guided Access user can just


932
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:36,786
focus on what's really important


933
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:37,996
to enjoy playing the game.


934
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:40,836
For example, in Four in a Row, I


935
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:42,286
have this Auto Play button


936
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,946
that's a little confusing, it


937
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,276
lets the phone play against


938
00:27:45,276 --> 00:27:46,746
itself and so players who


939
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:48,686
stumble across it might not know


940
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:50,016
what happened or how to get back


941
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,106
to just playing the game.


942
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:53,756
In Guided Access, a caretaker


943
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,396
could put a restriction around


944
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:56,716
that button so that way the


945
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,106
Guided Access user can just


946
00:27:58,106 --> 00:27:59,536
enjoy the game without worrying


947
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:01,686
about accidentally pressing it.


948
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,756
If your game has things that it


949
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:05,016
would make sense to restrict,


950
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:07,136
you can use custom restrictions


951
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:08,296
in the accessibility API.


952
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:10,386
These are used in setting up


953
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:12,596
Guided Access in an app.


954
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:14,446
And then when the player plays


955
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:16,196
them, those things are hidden or


956
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,576
locked, so they can't


957
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,176
accidentally use them.


958
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:24,036
You may also want to provide


959
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,476
different modes in your game.


960
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:27,056
Real Racing has different


961
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,956
options for drivers that lets


962
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:30,726
players focus on one aspect of


963
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:31,556
the game at a time.


964
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:33,936
Depending on your game it might


965
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:34,856
make sense to use different


966
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:36,526
levels instead, but you want to


967
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:37,716
make sure you're not preventing


968
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,806
players from completing your


969
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:40,686
game.


970
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:42,276
I want Four and a Row to be


971
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:43,846
timed, so players really feel


972
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:45,006
the pressure when making their


973
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:45,356
move.


974
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,546
However, a timed version could


975
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:48,836
be a lot less fun for a lot of


976
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:50,266
players, including those with


977
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:51,666
cognitive disabilities.


978
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:53,726
So, I'll add another option for


979
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:55,316
an untimed mode in the game as


980
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:55,556
well.


981
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:58,786
I've added leaderboards to Four


982
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:00,256
in a Row, but I have to think


983
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:01,746
about what ranking means to my


984
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:02,196
players.


985
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:04,606
I have diverse set of players


986
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:05,756
playing my game in many


987
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:07,106
different ways, and I don't want


988
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:08,026
it to feel unfair.


989
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,196
I'll create leaderboards for the


990
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:11,256
different modes that you can


991
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,866
play my game in so that way


992
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:14,356
players in the untimed mode can


993
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:15,746
compete against each other


994
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:16,986
without worrying about what


995
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:18,216
times the players in the timed


996
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:19,146
mode are achieving.


997
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,726
Cognitive accessibility covers a


998
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,326
wide range of users, and there's


999
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:25,656
a lot you can do in your game.


1000
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:28,186
Use multiple methods for


1001
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:29,866
providing content like speech


1002
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:30,676
with captions.


1003
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,306
Make instructions and tutorials


1004
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:34,726
easy to access while playing the


1005
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:35,196
game.


1006
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,586
Support Guided Access so players


1007
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:39,536
can focus on just what's


1008
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:40,896
important to enjoy the game.


1009
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:42,686
And offer different game modes


1010
00:29:42,686 --> 00:29:44,326
or levels, each with their own


1011
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:45,786
leaderboards, so players can


1012
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:46,636
compete fairly.


1013
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,036
OK, so now I want to show you


1014
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,936
some of the Accessibility


1015
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:50,146
Settings we did in our game.


1016
00:29:55,106 --> 00:29:56,616
So, I have my game running in


1017
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:57,946
the simulator right now with the


1018
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:59,056
Accessibility Inspector.


1019
00:29:59,056 --> 00:30:00,736
And I found the Accessibility


1020
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:02,116
Inspector in Xcode under


1021
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:03,086
Developer Tools.


1022
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:04,496
And there's a lot you can do


1023
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:04,746
here.


1024
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:05,686
And I'm not really going to go


1025
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:06,806
into it because there's a really


1026
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:07,986
great talk in it last year.


1027
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:09,936
But over here you can inspect


1028
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:10,396
your app.


1029
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:11,396
And so, it will tell you what


1030
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:12,396
different accessibility


1031
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,936
information it can get about the


1032
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:15,036
things in your app.


1033
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:16,856
Or you could run an audit which


1034
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,036
is really helpful, because it


1035
00:30:18,036 --> 00:30:18,986
will just highlight some


1036
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,396
different accessibility bugs you


1037
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:21,436
might have in your game.


1038
00:30:22,246 --> 00:30:23,146
But, today we're going to look


1039
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:23,956
at the settings tab.


1040
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,116
And this is really cool, because


1041
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,606
it lets you test different


1042
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,186
accessibility settings without


1043
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:29,966
leaving your game.


1044
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,296
And I'm just doing this on the


1045
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,176
simulator, but up here if you


1046
00:30:33,176 --> 00:30:34,326
have your phone plugged in, you


1047
00:30:34,326 --> 00:30:36,726
can actually pick your phone too


1048
00:30:37,006 --> 00:30:38,346
and so you could do it on device


1049
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:39,726
and that way you don't have to


1050
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:41,496
leave your game and like go into


1051
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:42,356
settings and go back.


1052
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:43,126
So, it's really handy.


1053
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:45,666
So, one that we did was reduce


1054
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,546
transparency.


1055
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:47,506
And for that we just did a


1056
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:49,146
simple black background to make


1057
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:50,536
the gameboard really stand out.


1058
00:30:51,736 --> 00:30:53,246
We also supported different font


1059
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:54,786
sizes for dynamic type.


1060
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,066
So, there's a slider here and I


1061
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,616
can just make the fonts bigger


1062
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:58,276
or smaller.


1063
00:30:59,286 --> 00:31:00,966
And the next one is invert


1064
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:01,446
colors.


1065
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:03,466
And to know why we implemented


1066
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:04,956
it the way we did, you have to


1067
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,326
know a little bit about how it's


1068
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:06,846
used.


1069
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,016
So, invert colors is used by


1070
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:10,506
players who have difficulty


1071
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,226
reading dark text on a light


1072
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:13,036
background because the


1073
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:14,326
brightness of the background


1074
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,606
interferes with their vision.


1075
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,486
So, they'll use invert colors,


1076
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:18,916
to make that light text on a


1077
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,026
dark background instead.


1078
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,186
Since our game is already like


1079
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,946
that, we used the accessibility


1080
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:25,496
API to tell it not to invert


1081
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,656
colors for this screen.


1082
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:28,636
So, when I do invert colors,


1083
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:30,096
nothing happens.


1084
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,646
But if I go to like settings,


1085
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,636
which is normally white, it's


1086
00:31:33,636 --> 00:31:34,126
all black.


1087
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:36,626
And then if I uncheck it, it


1088
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,006
goes back to white.


1089
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,056
So, we have a lot of different


1090
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,306
settings here in this game that


1091
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:43,046
we added for accessibility


1092
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:43,466
reasons.


1093
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,786
So, let's check that out as


1094
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:45,036
well.


1095
00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:48,786
So, here's my Four in a Row app.


1096
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:50,136
I can just tap on a column to


1097
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:50,796
make a move.


1098
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,686
But more exciting than the game


1099
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:54,846
is the settings.


1100
00:31:55,116 --> 00:31:56,626
And we have a lot here.


1101
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,216
So, first is volume.


1102
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,296
We added different sliders for


1103
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:01,646
the speech and the sound effects


1104
00:32:01,646 --> 00:32:03,236
because people who are hard of


1105
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:05,516
hearing might want to emphasize


1106
00:32:05,516 --> 00:32:06,586
the speech over the sound


1107
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:06,956
effects.


1108
00:32:07,556 --> 00:32:08,716
So, we could turn down the sound


1109
00:32:08,716 --> 00:32:08,976
effects.


1110
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:13,536
We also have captions.


1111
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:14,956
And so, those are just going


1112
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:16,306
directly from the settings for


1113
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:16,926
your phone.


1114
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:18,586
And we have Differentiate


1115
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:19,256
Without Color.


1116
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,626
And if you noticed before, right


1117
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:22,856
now it's all circles.


1118
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,766
But when I turn on Differentiate


1119
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:27,266
Without Colors, we made it so


1120
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:28,616
now it's circles and triangles.


1121
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:30,216
So, it's easier to tell apart


1122
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:31,716
the different players.


1123
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:34,526
So, we have a lot of other


1124
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:35,946
settings here, but the one I


1125
00:32:35,946 --> 00:32:38,016
wanted to focus on was timing.


1126
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:40,916
We added a Turn Time slider


1127
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,336
which is great because that


1128
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,076
gives players who have trouble


1129
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:45,096
coming up their next move or


1130
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,646
difficulty moving that quickly


1131
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,016
some extra time to make their


1132
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:48,426
move.


1133
00:32:49,006 --> 00:32:49,956
But for now, I'm going to turn


1134
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:51,076
off the timed mode because I'm


1135
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:52,066
going to be testing this out


1136
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,566
with some assistive technologies


1137
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:55,626
and the combination me using


1138
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:56,646
them and talking about them is


1139
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:57,526
going to slow me down a little


1140
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:57,796
bit.


1141
00:32:58,406 --> 00:33:01,446
So, oh, yeah and I'm already


1142
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:02,646
very close to losing.


1143
00:33:02,736 --> 00:33:04,076
So, I'm glad I turned that off.


1144
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:05,686
Okay, so now I'm going to test


1145
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:07,216
it out with VoiceOver.


1146
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:09,166
And I have VoiceOver set up on


1147
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,456
my accessibility shortcut.


1148
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:12,296
So, I can just triple tap on


1149
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,386
home and turn on voice over.


1150
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:15,976
>> VoiceOver on.


1151
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:16,666
Landscape.


1152
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,736
Four in a Row.


1153
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:18,856
Empty image.


1154
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:21,116
>> So, it's labelled.


1155
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:21,536
That's good.


1156
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:23,396
And I can swipe through and hear


1157
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:25,376
all the cells in the gameboard.


1158
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:28,576
>> Move empty image, empty


1159
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:30,716
image, empty image.


1160
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:34,166
Winner, four question marks.


1161
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,956
Actions of player B, image.


1162
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:37,186
Player B image.


1163
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:41,396
Actions available.


1164
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:43,806
>> So, I can move to everything.


1165
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:45,426
It's labelled, it's accessible,


1166
00:33:45,426 --> 00:33:46,746
but when I was testing this out


1167
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:48,566
earlier in VoiceOver, I found it


1168
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:49,776
just wasn't a really fun


1169
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:50,326
experience.


1170
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,356
It was too hard to move through


1171
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:53,766
all the different slots on the


1172
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,856
gameboard, keep track in your


1173
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:56,936
head of which ones were filled


1174
00:33:56,936 --> 00:33:57,966
and which weren't and come up


1175
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,556
with what your next move should


1176
00:33:59,556 --> 00:33:59,836
be.


1177
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:02,116
So, I used something in the


1178
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:03,636
accessibility API called the


1179
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:05,216
Custom Action to improve that


1180
00:34:05,216 --> 00:34:05,956
experience.


1181
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:07,846
I added an action that switches


1182
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,306
you from moving by cell to


1183
00:34:09,306 --> 00:34:10,156
moving by column.


1184
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,085
Let's do that.


1185
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:16,056
>> Move by cell, move by column.


1186
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:20,606
Column 3, 4 empty cells, 2


1187
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:21,656
player A tokens.


1188
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:24,255
>> So, that way VoiceOver can


1189
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:25,606
move via column instead of by


1190
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,376
cell and that makes it a lot


1191
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:28,636
easier for me to just get a


1192
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,056
sense of what the gameboard is


1193
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:30,123
in.


1194
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:32,266
And that technique I used for


1195
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:34,216
making it move by column instead


1196
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:35,516
of by cell was also really


1197
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:36,636
helpful for Switch Control.


1198
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:37,686
So, let me show you that.


1199
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:39,275
I'm going to turn off VoiceOver


1200
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:40,306
and switch over to Switch


1201
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:40,676
Control.


1202
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:43,686
>> Alert. Accessibility list


1203
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:44,966
control button.


1204
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:45,976
VoiceOver off.


1205
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:50,406
>> OK, so now I have Switch


1206
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:51,846
Control on and I have my switch


1207
00:34:51,846 --> 00:34:52,166
here.


1208
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:54,815
And Switch Control is scanning


1209
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:57,096
all the things, I'm sorry.


1210
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:58,316
Switch Control is scanning all


1211
00:34:58,316 --> 00:34:59,876
the items on the screen and so


1212
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:02,396
when I go into the gameboard,


1213
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:04,236
it's going to, before it was


1214
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,236
going by cell, and it was super


1215
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:07,826
tedious to try to wait for it to


1216
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:09,536
go through each cell to get to


1217
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:10,556
the one that I wanted.


1218
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,126
But now, when I go into the


1219
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:14,556
gameboard, it's going by column


1220
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:15,726
instead of by cell, which it did


1221
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:16,876
originally, and so I was able to


1222
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:18,516
use accessibility API to change


1223
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,566
that experience to make it


1224
00:35:19,566 --> 00:35:19,866
better.


1225
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:21,696
So now I can just press my


1226
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:24,246
switch and make my move.


1227
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:28,196
So, let me show you some other


1228
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,486
things that we did.


1229
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:30,976
Let me turn off Switch Control.


1230
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:34,986
And right now, if you're


1231
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:36,986
noticing I have my screen setup


1232
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:38,036
to be a switch too.


1233
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,056
And that's an awesome option for


1234
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,086
testing, because that way you


1235
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:42,436
don't need to set up a switch.


1236
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,716
So, you're just, your phone


1237
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:45,716
works as a switch.


1238
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,446
Okay, so we also made it work


1239
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,086
with a keyboard.


1240
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,226
And so, I mentioned earlier for


1241
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:51,406
that, you needed to do a


1242
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:53,356
selection mechanism, so that way


1243
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:55,586
when I hit the arrow keys, I can


1244
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,256
move by column, and then just


1245
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,246
press space to make my move.


1246
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:03,736
So, providing these options for


1247
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:04,726
these different assistive


1248
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:06,036
technologies really broadens


1249
00:36:06,036 --> 00:36:06,836
into my audience.


1250
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:07,956
It means a lot more people will


1251
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:09,246
be able to play our game.


1252
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:12,576
We were able to make a lot of


1253
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,766
improvements to our game by


1254
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:14,896
testing it out with different


1255
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:16,136
assistive technologies and


1256
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:17,496
accessibility settings.


1257
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:19,116
When you're doing this, it can


1258
00:36:19,116 --> 00:36:20,686
be easy to fall into the trap of


1259
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:22,116
following the letter of the law,


1260
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:23,136
but not the spirit.


1261
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,186
As well as being accessible, you


1262
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:26,466
want your game to be fun to play


1263
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:27,186
for everyone.


1264
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:29,826
The accessibility API offers a


1265
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:31,256
lot of great tools for improving


1266
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,306
that experience.


1267
00:36:33,696 --> 00:36:35,036
Now, you may be thinking about


1268
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:36,606
your own app and how you can get


1269
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,056
started making it accessible.


1270
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:39,926
The three things you can do the


1271
00:36:39,926 --> 00:36:41,556
minute you walk out of here are


1272
00:36:41,556 --> 00:36:43,696
to audit your app, test it out


1273
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:44,756
with different accessibility


1274
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:46,746
settings, and most importantly,


1275
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:48,196
talk to assistive technology


1276
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:48,886
users.


1277
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:52,956
So, we already mentioned this


1278
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:53,986
talk a little bit, but it's


1279
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:54,556
really good.


1280
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:55,456
So, you can learn more about


1281
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:56,766
both auditing your app and


1282
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:57,906
testing it with accessibility


1283
00:36:57,906 --> 00:36:59,746
settings and Auditing your Apps


1284
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:01,296
for Accessibility talk from last


1285
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:01,466
year.


1286
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,916
It's really important to test


1287
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,256
out your game with assistive


1288
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:07,646
technologies, but you should


1289
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:09,126
also try to talk to the users


1290
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,186
who use them every day.


1291
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:11,696
They'll have a firsthand


1292
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,036
experience of what separates a


1293
00:37:13,036 --> 00:37:14,446
good experience from a great


1294
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:14,876
experience.


1295
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:16,316
And they'll probably have a lot


1296
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:17,646
of ideas for how you can make


1297
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:18,836
your game more accessible.


1298
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,366
You can connect with


1299
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:21,666
accessibility users and


1300
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:23,136
developers at our get-together


1301
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:23,456
tonight.


1302
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:25,616
Designing your game for


1303
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:27,296
accessibility really means more


1304
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:28,966
people can enjoy it.


1305
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:31,026
When you're designing for


1306
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,336
accessibility think about how


1307
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,616
accessibility is really a


1308
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:34,206
spectrum.


1309
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:35,576
So, you want to create these


1310
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:37,326
different great experiences so


1311
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:38,966
each player can find out their


1312
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:39,716
own perfect fit.


1313
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:42,606
At the end of the day, your game


1314
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:43,876
will be stronger and richer,


1315
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:45,156
because designing for


1316
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:46,436
accessibility is really


1317
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:47,616
designing for everyone.


1318
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:50,636
You can find out more


1319
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,656
information on and the developer


1320
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:53,136
website.


1321
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:54,226
You can see this session again,


1322
00:37:54,226 --> 00:37:55,426
and I think we have some notes


1323
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:56,406
and information there.


1324
00:37:57,806 --> 00:37:59,386
There's a lot of other related


1325
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:00,886
sessions going on this week and


1326
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:01,886
there's more that you can see


1327
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,426
online from some previous years.


1328
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,656
Thank you and enjoy the rest the


1329
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:05,946
conference.
