00:00:07,516 --> 00:00:16,500
[ Cheers ]

00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:25,896
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:27,726
>> Good afternoon everybody!


4
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:30,256
Welcome to WWDC2017.


5
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:32,206
My name is David Duncan.


6
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:34,536
I'll be joined by Raj Ramamurphy


7
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:35,626
[phonetic] and Kyle Sluder


8
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:35,693
[phonetic].


9
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:37,506
And we're here to talk to you


10
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:39,946
about updating your app for iOS


11
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:40,476
11.


12
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,076
So first a little agenda for


13
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:46,416
what we're going to talk about


14
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:46,906
today.


15
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:48,966
The first thing that I'm going


16
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,116
to be discussing with you is


17
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:52,486
adopting new functionality in UI


18
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,586
kits bars; UI navigation bar, UI


19
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:58,426
tab bar, UI toolbar, and UI


20
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,086
search bar.


21
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:00,736
And we're going to talk to you


22
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:02,216
about how these can update your


23
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:04,135
app to the new looks that we've


24
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,056
introduced throughout iOS 11.


25
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,956
Next Kyle will come up and talk


26
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:11,116
to you a bit about managing


27
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:13,116
margins and insets, changes that


28
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,656
we've made to UI scroll view and


29
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,816
table view will come after that,


30
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:21,286
and we're going to use all that


31
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:22,186
to show you how you can make


32
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:22,686
your app better.


33
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,086
So let's start by taking a look


34
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,936
at the files app.


35
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:29,896
So if you've gotten the chance


36
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:31,616
to install the beta and take a


37
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:33,176
look at the files app, you'll


38
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,586
see some changes that it's


39
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:37,586
taking advantage of from UI kit.


40
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,636
You can see that giant, large


41
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:41,126
title view up there showing the


42
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:42,116
browse feature.


43
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:43,986
You've got a search bar right


44
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:45,246
below it that has a bit of a


45
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:46,446
different appearance from any


46
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:47,596
search bar you've probably seen


47
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:48,526
before.


48
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:51,266
Now the tab bar actually has


49
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:53,066
some changes, but you won't see


50
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,466
them here so let's go ahead and


51
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,696
rotate this to landscape.


52
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:58,496
We've got this brand new


53
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:00,416
appearance for the tab bar, both


54
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,876
in landscape and on iPad, where


55
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,556
we show the icon and the text


56
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:05,316
side by side.


57
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:08,436
And in particular on iPhones the


58
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:10,106
icon is smaller and the tab bar


59
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:11,366
is smaller to give a bit more


60
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,006
room vertically.


61
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:13,836
We're going to discuss how you


62
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:15,576
can customize the icons for


63
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,066
landscape and tab bar as well.


64
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,796
Now things getting smaller can


65
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,826
sometimes be a problem for users


66
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,156
that are hard of vision or


67
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,176
otherwise need a little


68
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,166
assistance to see things


69
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:26,636
clearer.


70
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:28,856
We've got you covered there too.


71
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:32,116
If you turn on larger text then


72
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:34,156
when you long press on one of


73
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:35,996
these items -- this is in tab


74
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:38,356
bar, tool bar, and navigation


75
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,606
bar -- we'll put up this HUD


76
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:43,026
that shows you clearly what the


77
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,206
text is and what the icon is.


78
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,586
And now I'm going to explain how


79
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:48,806
both of these features can be


80
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:50,066
adopted in your app and they're


81
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:50,976
really, really easy.


82
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,126
So there's this class called UI


83
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:56,776
Bar Item that you probably never


84
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,216
thought much about because it's


85
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,406
actually the super class of two


86
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:02,586
important bar item classes in UI


87
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:05,136
kit; UI tab bar item and UI bar


88
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:05,666
button item.


89
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:09,286
And so to customize the image in


90
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,766
landscape on that tab bar all


91
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,946
you have to do is set this


92
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:14,836
property, the landscape image


93
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:17,166
phone property, on any UI tab


94
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:18,906
bar items that you're placing in


95
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:19,656
your tab bars.


96
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:21,446
And of course we'll have support


97
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:22,456
for this in storyboards and


98
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,116
everywhere else, but that's how


99
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,096
you would customize that.


100
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,126
And there are also some inset


101
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,226
properties in case you need


102
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:27,536
those.


103
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,876
For that HUD image we've got


104
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,436
another related property called


105
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:35,736
the Large Content Size Image.


106
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:38,856
Now you can set this, put a big


107
00:03:38,856 --> 00:03:40,186
image in there, it'll appear in


108
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,726
the HUD, but if you're using PDF


109
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:45,236
assets in your asset catalogue


110
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:46,386
it's even easier.


111
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,676
All you have to do is set that


112
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:53,156
preserve PDF data and we'll


113
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:55,566
automatically pick up the PDF


114
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,036
data, resize it larger, and


115
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,406
display it in that HUD without


116
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,516
you having to do anything to


117
00:03:59,516 --> 00:03:59,976
your assets.


118
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:06,426
So if you wanted to learn more


119
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:07,636
about accessibility features


120
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:08,976
such as the HUD and how you can


121
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,526
pick that up, there's the What's


122
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:11,796
New in Accessibility session


123
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:12,946
happening this Wednesday.


124
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:14,356
I recommend you go there to


125
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:15,386
learn all about what's new in


126
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,016
accessibility in iOS 11.


127
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:19,886
And so let's talk next about


128
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:20,956
navigation bar.


129
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,836
How do we get those large titles


130
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,296
that appeared in the files app


131
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,286
and other apps across the


132
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:25,516
system?


133
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:28,926
So first there's a new property


134
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:31,436
on UI navigation bar, prefers


135
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:32,296
large titles.


136
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,566
If you set this to "true" on any


137
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,686
given navigation bar then you'll


138
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,486
start seeing large titles all


139
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,486
across the system -- all across


140
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,136
your application.


141
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:42,796
Now you might be wondering; what


142
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,326
do these other three words that


143
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,556
I've got here on this slide --


144
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:46,476
maybe they're a little hard to


145
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:48,026
see, but automatic, always, and


146
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:48,906
never -- what does that have to


147
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:49,296
do with?


148
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:51,776
Well, there's a second property


149
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:52,996
to control when these appear;


150
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:55,176
the large title display mode.


151
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,346
This is what easily allows you


152
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,546
to determine for each view


153
00:04:58,546 --> 00:04:59,846
control you push onto a nav


154
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:01,126
controller or to a navigation


155
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,436
bar stack when the large title


156
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:03,976
appears.


157
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,516
And let me show you how that


158
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:05,866
works.


159
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:09,046
So we turned on large titles on


160
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,286
this navigation bar and we put


161
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:12,116
an item on there.


162
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,346
It defaults to automatic and


163
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:16,456
automatic means whatever the


164
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,506
current state is, whoever asked


165
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,436
last for that bar to appear,


166
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:21,496
keep it.


167
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,326
Since nothing else is on the


168
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:24,646
stack and we turned on large


169
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:26,226
titles, we have a large title.


170
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,226
But let's go ahead and push a


171
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,516
navigation item that we don't


172
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:30,896
want to display that large title


173
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,996
on and we just set the large


174
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,326
title display mode to "never"


175
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,526
and the large title goes away.


176
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:38,876
Now again we'll push an


177
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:40,506
"automatic," preserve whatever


178
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,126
we have now, and so we don't get


179
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,926
a large title, and then we'll


180
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,286
push "always," and now the large


181
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:47,026
title is back.


182
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,546
And again, we can push an


183
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:50,796
"automatic" and we're all there.


184
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:54,266
Simple. So there are two more


185
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,736
things we want to talk about on


186
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:58,706
navigation item and the first is


187
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,226
how to integrate the search


188
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,486
controller and the new search


189
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,916
bar look with your navigation


190
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,256
bars.


191
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,316
There's a single property again,


192
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:07,726
navigation item search


193
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:08,256
controller.


194
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:09,476
You assign your search


195
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:10,526
controller to the navigation


196
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,476
item and you're done.


197
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:14,556
The search bar is placed


198
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,326
correctly and it behaves just as


199
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,436
it does in a lot of our apps.


200
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:20,636
Now if you've actually gotten a


201
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:22,486
chance to play with "files" or


202
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:23,696
"mail" or some of the others


203
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:24,806
you'll notice that sometimes


204
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:26,396
that search bar stays pegged


205
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,436
when you scroll, sometimes it


206
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:28,186
does not.


207
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,516
In particular in "files" it


208
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:31,216
stays pegged and that's


209
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,346
controlled by this "hide search


210
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:35,266
bar when scrolling" property.


211
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:37,276
It defaults to "true."


212
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:38,686
So, for example in "mail" it


213
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,916
scrolls away, but in "files"


214
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:41,936
they've turned it off.


215
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,346
And so it stays pegged.


216
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:44,396
You can always reach the search


217
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:46,726
bar and it looks great.


218
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,796
So how does all this work?


219
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:51,106
A little bit of behind the


220
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,166
scenes on some of these things.


221
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,156
And the first thing you should


222
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:55,676
know is that a lot of these


223
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,806
interactions are actually


224
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:58,626
mediated by UI navigation


225
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,106
controller.


226
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,226
So if you're taking the


227
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:03,066
navigation bar and assembling


228
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,346
kind of the entire push and pop


229
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:05,746
experience yourself, and not


230
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,476
many people do, but if you are


231
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:08,946
you're not going to get some of


232
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:09,626
these features.


233
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,636
In particular you're not going


234
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:12,576
to get the search controller


235
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:13,186
integration.


236
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,536
You're not going to get refresh


237
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,636
controls hoisting and you're not


238
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,586
going to get rubber bending.


239
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:19,956
Rubber bending is when you start


240
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,456
pulling down, that large title


241
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,496
grows larger, and responds to


242
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:24,086
that scroller.


243
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,606
So that's navigation bar,


244
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:29,386
navigation controller, and those


245
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:30,816
new large title features.


246
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,716
But while we're here making all


247
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:34,826
of these changes we figured


248
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,016
let's actually make some other


249
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,346
changes to help your lives be


250
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,636
easier as well.


251
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:42,756
And so now in iOS 11, UI toolbar


252
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:45,846
and UI navigation bar both have


253
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:47,596
intricate and express support


254
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:47,976
for auto layout.


255
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:54,106
[ Applause ]


256
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:56,266
So what this means is that your


257
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,706
custom bar button items, your


258
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:59,216
custom title of use, can now use


259
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:01,126
layout to express their size to


260
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:03,276
us and get the proper layout


261
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:04,466
that you would otherwise expect.


262
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:06,726
Now there are a few things to


263
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:07,346
keep in mind.


264
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:08,966
One of them is you kind of want


265
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,216
to keep your constraints inside


266
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:10,776
of that view.


267
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:12,546
So if you give us a custom title


268
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:13,496
view you want to make sure that


269
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:15,356
any constraints there only


270
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:16,946
reference that title view and


271
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,566
any of its sub-views.


272
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,776
And this one is kind of big, but


273
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:23,246
it's kind of worth bringing out,


274
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,136
is that when you use auto layout


275
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:26,216
we also assume you know what


276
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,746
you're doing [laughter] and the


277
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:30,866
reason why I bring this up is


278
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,866
because otherwise you end up in


279
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,586
this case where you have to --


280
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,586
you get zero sized views.


281
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,155
So how do you avoid these zero


282
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:39,876
sized views?


283
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:43,155
Well, UI navigation bar and UI


284
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,316
toolbar provide positioning


285
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:44,876
information.


286
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,366
Zero sized views end up becoming


287
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:48,806
because you have some ambiguous


288
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:49,606
constraint layout.


289
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:51,246
And so the position is taken


290
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:51,886
care of for you.


291
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:52,946
You won't get your views shoved


292
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,086
up in an upper left corner


293
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:56,366
somewhere, but you still have to


294
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:57,866
provide sizing for us.


295
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:59,406
And there are three ways you can


296
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,256
do that.


297
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:03,096
You could add constraints for


298
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:04,376
width and height; perfectly


299
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,756
legal, perfectly legitimate.


300
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,536
Do that. You can put whatever


301
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:08,966
else you want in there and


302
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:09,686
you're golden.


303
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:12,376
You could also implement


304
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:13,816
intrinsic content size.


305
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:15,626
That'll also give us as much


306
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,856
information as we need.


307
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:18,446
You go along with the content


308
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:19,336
compression hugging and


309
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:20,586
compression resistance and


310
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:21,706
you're set.


311
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,566
But finally, the most easy way,


312
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,566
for most people, is to actually


313
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,586
make sure that all of your


314
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,286
sub-views are properly connected


315
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:30,486
and set up with auto layout.


316
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,826
And what that means is let's say


317
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:34,956
you have a custom title view and


318
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:36,276
you have a label and a button in


319
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,416
there, if you want to make sure


320
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,726
that you get the proper


321
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,426
horizontal width of that title


322
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:43,556
view you just need to make sure


323
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,426
that there are constraints set


324
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:46,716
up between those labels and


325
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,146
buttons such that the leading


326
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:50,156
and trailing edge, or the width,


327
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,936
of that title view is defined in


328
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:53,046
terms of those two views.


329
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,266
And so that's how you can use


330
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:59,006
auto layout to add precise


331
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,706
control to the size of your


332
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,006
custom title views and bar


333
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:02,706
button items.


334
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,446
Now, to demonstrate all the


335
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:06,656
things we've talked about today


336
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:07,596
we bring up Raj Ramamurphy to


337
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:07,966
give you a demo.

[ Applause ]


339
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:17,396
>> Thanks David.


340
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,986
So as David just explained, we


341
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,956
have a bunch of great new API in


342
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,916
iOS 11 for these new, large


343
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:24,696
navigation bars.


344
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,326
I'm going to walk you through


345
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,226
updating an app for iOS 11.


346
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:30,166
So here's a sample app we're


347
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,176
going to be working with today.


348
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,826
It's a pretty simple app called


349
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:33,586
"Trail Diary."


350
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:35,276
It's just a diary of some trails


351
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:35,776
I visited.


352
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,846
So here we are in the main view


353
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,936
controller, which I called the


354
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:40,016
"memory view controller."


355
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:42,056
Now, if I tap on one of these


356
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:43,666
cells you'll notice I get a


357
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,766
detail view controller.


358
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,586
This contains a photo, a


359
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:47,736
description, and some


360
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:48,646
information about this.


361
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:50,776
There's also a way to add


362
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,046
comments, and we're going to get


363
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:52,986
into that a little bit later,


364
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,276
but for now let's start updating


365
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,436
this app for iOS 11.


366
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,616
One of the first things I'd like


367
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,686
to do is introduce support in


368
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,096
this application for those


369
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,396
beautiful, new large titles.


370
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,136
So let's go ahead and do that.


371
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,826
We'll go over to the navigation


372
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:08,976
-- or sorry -- to the memory


373
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,876
view controller here and we're


374
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:11,726
going to get the navigation


375
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:11,976
controller.


376
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:19,836
Get the navigation bar and set


377
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:22,256
the "prefers large titles"


378
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:24,056
property on the navigation bar.


379
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,516
Now, when we set this property


380
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,216
we get large titles everywhere.


381
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,836
And if I recompile and rerun the


382
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:34,716
application, head back over to


383
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,106
it, and bring up the memory view


384
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:39,316
controller you'll notice we have


385
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:41,356
this beautiful, large title, and


386
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:42,616
since we already have a refresh


387
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:44,206
control that gets hoisted into


388
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,686
the navigation bar and we get


389
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:46,926
the rubber banding experience --


390
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:48,036
everything's looking great.


391
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,386
Now, "prefers large titles" will


392
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:52,266
turn large titles on everywhere.


393
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:54,506
So if I tap back into the detail


394
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,946
view controller you'll see we


395
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:57,546
get a really nice transition and


396
00:11:57,546 --> 00:11:58,386
we have the detail view


397
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:59,716
controller showing a large title


398
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:00,126
as well.


399
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:02,656
Now this is great, but sometimes


400
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:03,876
the large title isn't what you


401
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:04,816
want everywhere.


402
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,966
And so for that, as David


403
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,786
explained, we have the


404
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:10,856
navigation item property, "large


405
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,706
title display mode."


406
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:15,416
So in this view I'd like to show


407
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,596
the standard inline title.


408
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,356
So let's update this view


409
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:19,816
controller to show that.


410
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:22,936
If I go over to the detail view


411
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,186
controller and set its


412
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:26,346
navigation items' large title


413
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,506
display mode to "never," as


414
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:29,786
David showed you before with the


415
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:33,596
stack, if we recompile and rerun


416
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:35,446
the application, we'll start out


417
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,996
with the large title, but if I


418
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:39,586
push view controller now we have


419
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,216
this standard inline title and


420
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,136
you get a great transition


421
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,416
between them and everything's


422
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,166
looking really great.


423
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:46,066
So that's how to use the


424
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:48,246
navigation item properties for


425
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:50,536
showing the large title, but I'd


426
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,806
also like to add search to this


427
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:52,426
application.


428
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:54,496
So I've already gone ahead and


429
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:55,576
configured a search controller


430
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,066
instance and I just need to show


431
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:57,986
the search bar in the


432
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,566
application.


433
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,486
As you may have seen, we're


434
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:01,696
showing search bars in the


435
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,056
navigation in iOS 11.


436
00:13:04,346 --> 00:13:05,476
So let's add that appearance.


437
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,516
If I go over to the memory view


438
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,476
controller again and set the


439
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:12,396
navigation item's search


440
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:13,696
controller property to our


441
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,586
instance -- in this case it's


442
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,926
just called "search controller."


443
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:22,646
Recompile and rerun the


444
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:22,976
application.


445
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,006
You'll notice when the


446
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,226
application comes up into the


447
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,386
memory view controller, we still


448
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:33,796
have the large title, but now if


449
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,236
we pull down we get this


450
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:36,726
beautiful new search appearance.


451
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:38,816
So this app is looking really


452
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:39,166
great.


453
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:42,606
So that's just how to update


454
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,236
some of your bars for the new


455
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,496
appearance in iOS 11.


456
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,496
Now I'd like to bring Kyle


457
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:49,016
Sluder up who's going to talk to


458
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,706
you about margins, insets, and


459
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:50,976
scroll views.


460
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:56,666
[ Applause ]


461
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,166
>> Well done.


462
00:13:59,346 --> 00:13:59,976
Thank you Raj.


463
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:06,156
So in iOS 11 we've made a number


464
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:07,546
of improvements to give you more


465
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,396
information and better control


466
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:10,766
over how your views lay out


467
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,756
their user interfaces.


468
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:13,806
And let's start by talking about


469
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:14,756
layout margins.


470
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:16,756
Layout margins are a portion of


471
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,146
the interior of your views that


472
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:21,506
UI kit gives you as a guide to


473
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:22,666
layout your content and give a


474
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,706
little breathing room between it


475
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:25,556
and the surrounding user


476
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:26,406
interface elements.


477
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,116
And we give this information to


478
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:28,906
you in two ways.


479
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:30,966
The first is a UI layout guide


480
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,736
object, which you can use with


481
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,546
auto layout to position your


482
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:35,026
content.


483
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,116
The second is a set of edge


484
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:38,636
insets.


485
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:40,086
And you can read these from your


486
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,886
view and write to them to


487
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:43,206
customize your layout margins.


488
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:45,926
In iOS 11 we're adding a new


489
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,656
property; directional layout


490
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:48,196
margins.


491
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:49,946
And this allows you to express


492
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:50,996
the layout margins in your


493
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:52,566
views, not just in left and


494
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,126
right terms, but in leading and


495
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:54,556
trailing.


496
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,296
And these two properties are in


497
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,086
sync with each other.


498
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,676
The left property is in sync


499
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,566
with the leading, when you're


500
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:03,106
writing in an LTR or left to


501
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:04,196
right language.


502
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:05,526
And the right property and the


503
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:06,686
trailing property are in sync.


504
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:09,106
So I can do something like write


505
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:10,436
a value to the trailing property


506
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,456
of this view, which will cause


507
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:15,056
its layout to adjust, and then


508
00:15:15,056 --> 00:15:15,896
when I'm running in a right to


509
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:17,806
left language that trailing


510
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,516
space will be put on the left


511
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:21,576
side of the view and my layout


512
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:22,946
code can then read it from the


513
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:23,706
left property of the layout


514
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:23,956
margin.


515
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:30,546
[ Applause ]


516
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:32,046
You may also be familiar with a


517
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:33,336
behavior that has existed since


518
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,596
we introduced layout margins


519
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:36,296
where adding a view to a view


520
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,196
controller would fix its layout


521
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,086
margins to UI kit defined


522
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:40,656
values.


523
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,596
Well starting in iOS 11 these


524
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,236
are no longer fixed values.


525
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:47,736
They're actually minimums.


526
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:49,776
And we communicate the size of


527
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,276
these values to you with this


528
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:53,106
new property, system minimum


529
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:54,106
layout margins.


530
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,806
And you can change your view's


531
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,616
layout margins to any greater


532
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:58,976
value, no changes needed.


533
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:03,976
[ Applause ]


534
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:05,976
But we went one step further and


535
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,826
we added another new property on


536
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:09,496
view controller; view respects


537
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,096
system minimum layout margins.


538
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:14,086
If you set this to "false" you


539
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,156
can actually change your layout


540
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,276
margins to whatever value you


541
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,276
want, including zero, and you


542
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,546
can have full width content in


543
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,256
any view including those that


544
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:21,926
are managed by a view


545
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:22,346
controller.


546
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:27,256
Since iOS 7 we've had these


547
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,306
translucent bars throughout the


548
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:30,746
operating system and we've


549
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:31,966
encouraged you to draw your


550
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:33,486
content through those bars, as


551
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:34,396
you can see happening here in


552
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:35,036
the photos app.


553
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:37,206
The way that you do this is


554
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,596
using the edges for extended


555
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,016
layout property on UI view


556
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:40,476
controller.


557
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:42,326
And what this does is it causes


558
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,096
container view controllers to


559
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:46,676
size your views underneath the


560
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:47,216
bars.


561
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:50,016
By default it applies to all


562
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:53,176
edges and we communicate to you


563
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:55,186
the size of the overhanging bars


564
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,176
via these two properties; top


565
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,556
layout guide and bottom layout


566
00:16:58,556 --> 00:16:58,806
guide.


567
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,176
Starting in iOS 11 we're


568
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:02,916
deprecating these properties and


569
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:03,836
replacing them with a new, more


570
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,396
powerful construct that we call


571
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:05,816
the "safe area."


572
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:11,726
The safe area is a way of


573
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,226
describing the portion of your


574
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:14,826
view that isn't occluded by any


575
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:15,476
content.


576
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:17,826
It's available to you as a set


577
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,695
of insets or as a UI layout


578
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:21,306
guide object.


579
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:24,116
And on TV it incorporates a very


580
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,866
useful bit of information called


581
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:28,226
the "over scan compensation


582
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:28,796
insets."


583
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:30,736
So any view on the screen can


584
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:32,606
layout its content and make sure


585
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:33,836
that it isn't overlapped by the


586
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,126
physical bezel of the


587
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:35,676
television.


588
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:38,156
Now if you have a custom


589
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,726
container view controller, you


590
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,176
might be adding your own bars


591
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:43,506
and you can increase the size of


592
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,096
the -- excuse me -- you can


593
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,916
increase the size of the safe


594
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,096
area insets via this new


595
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:51,036
property; additional safe area


596
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:51,666
insets.


597
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:53,616
And if any of your ancestor view


598
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,396
controllers change their size of


599
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,416
their safe area insets you will


600
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,666
get a call back in two different


601
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,056
ways.


602
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:01,066
Every view can get safe area


603
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,566
insets to change and view


604
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:03,906
controllers can get view safe


605
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:05,226
area insets to change.


606
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:07,816
[applause] Thank you.


607
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:10,456
[ Applause ]


608
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,576
So one really common view that's


609
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:14,086
used with UI view controller is


610
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:14,746
UI scroll view.


611
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:17,026
And in this little sample here I


612
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:18,286
have some text that's inside of


613
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,926
the UI scroll view and contained


614
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:21,636
within a navigation controller.


615
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:24,386
Now traditionally navigation


616
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,706
controllers would impart a


617
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,806
content inset to the scroll


618
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,296
views of their topmost view


619
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:30,766
controller.


620
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:33,156
We're making a really big change


621
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:34,886
here in iOS 11 and we're no


622
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:36,566
longer populating the content


623
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:37,596
inset property through scroll


624
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:37,876
views.


625
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:40,356
Instead we've added a new


626
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:42,176
property, adjusted content


627
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,536
inset, that includes the sum of


628
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,476
the content inset and any


629
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,096
overlap from container view


630
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:48,716
controllers.


631
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:51,376
This means you can use the


632
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:52,856
content inset property for


633
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:54,196
whatever purposes are


634
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:54,886
appropriate for your


635
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,356
application, such as this


636
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,436
additional information about


637
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:00,976
this text here, and we won't


638
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:01,456
change it.


639
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:02,886
And you don't have to worry


640
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:04,266
about saving and restoring any


641
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,906
UI kit provided values and


642
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:07,236
having content underlapping


643
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:08,816
navigation bars or the status


644
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:08,936
bar.


645
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:15,046
[ Applause ]


646
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:16,986
You may be familiar with our


647
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:18,466
auto layout support in UI scroll


648
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,436
view that lets you dictate how


649
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:21,806
big the scrollable region of


650
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:23,286
your scroll view is by


651
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:25,446
constraining sub-views to the


652
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:26,536
scroll view itself.


653
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:28,406
And we've added a couple of UI


654
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:30,056
layout guide objects that make


655
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,026
your layout more clear and more


656
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:33,436
expressive and more powerful.


657
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,756
The first is a UI layout guide


658
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:37,056
object called the frame layout


659
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:37,406
guide.


660
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:39,216
And this layout guide


661
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,096
corresponds to the position and


662
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,486
size of your scroll view in


663
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:44,636
screen space, which means you


664
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:45,976
can do things like constrain the


665
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,126
sub-view, like this page


666
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:48,476
indicator, and it will stay


667
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:50,016
fixed on screen as the user


668
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:50,616
scrolls.


669
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,216
The second layout guide object


670
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,676
we've added is the content


671
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:55,246
layout guide.


672
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:56,786
And you can contain your


673
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:58,146
sub-views in order to influence


674
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,656
the scrollable size of your


675
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,296
scroll view or have things move


676
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:03,456
as the user scrolls.


677
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,806
One really common sub class of


678
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,786
UI scroll view is UI table view


679
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:09,896
and we've made a number of


680
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:11,466
changes here too, the biggest of


681
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:13,446
which is that table views use


682
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,516
self-sizing by default on iOS


683
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,906
11, not on TVOS.


684
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:20,396
This means that your headers,


685
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:23,556
your footers, and your cells are


686
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,676
using estimated sizes.


687
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,066
We've done this by changing the


688
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,076
default value of the estimated


689
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:30,886
size properties on UI table view


690
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:32,576
to this constant, automatic


691
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:33,006
dimension.


692
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:35,916
This means that you need to


693
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,736
ensure that your cells all have


694
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,166
sufficient internal constraints


695
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,396
to tell UI table view how big


696
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:42,296
they should be or you need to


697
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,726
implement the delegate methods


698
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,356
that tell us how big your rows


699
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:45,586
are.


700
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:46,846
You should also implement those


701
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,446
delicate methods for you headers


702
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,536
and your footers.


703
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:52,286
Now maybe you want to link your


704
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,806
application against the iOS 11


705
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,966
SDK, but you're not ready to


706
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:57,186
adopt this new behavior.


707
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:59,026
You can opt out of it by setting


708
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,426
the estimated height properties


709
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,096
on your table views to zero.


710
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:03,926
That will turn off estimated


711
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:06,236
sizes, which will also disable


712
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:06,906
self-sizing.


713
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:11,096
Now you may be familiar with


714
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:12,226
another concept we introduced a


715
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:13,636
while back called the readable


716
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:14,466
content guide.


717
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:16,106
And this is a portion of your


718
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,516
views that if you lay out your


719
00:21:17,516 --> 00:21:18,806
content within, will be


720
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:20,056
comfortable to read even on a


721
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,876
large device like an iPad in


722
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:22,416
landscape.


723
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:25,906
Now by default table views have


724
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:28,106
a separator inset that is within


725
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,146
the readable content area and


726
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,446
this influences the position of


727
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,556
the separators and of the labels


728
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:34,796
in the table use content view


729
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:35,266
itself.


730
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:38,056
And if you change the separator


731
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:41,766
insets' values you would see


732
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:43,586
that the separator inset moves


733
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,596
relative to its readable content


734
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,176
guide position.


735
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,346
Starting in iOS 11 we're


736
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:51,436
changing this and the separator


737
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,226
insets will always be relative


738
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,366
to the edges of the cells


739
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,566
themselves, which are the full


740
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,966
width of the table view, which


741
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,526
means you can set these values


742
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,416
to zero and have full width,


743
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:03,476
full bleed content even on an


744
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:04,866
iPad running in landscape.


745
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:08,006
And this is a table view on an


746
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:10,726
iPhone and if I change the


747
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:12,976
separator inset here you can see


748
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,696
that it is also defined relative


749
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:16,316
to the edges of the cell -- to


750
00:22:16,316 --> 00:22:17,186
the edge of the table view.


751
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:19,416
We've added a new property to UI


752
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,886
table view, separator inset


753
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:23,236
reference, that you can use to


754
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,426
tell us that you actually just


755
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,036
want to adjust the separator


756
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:27,826
inset from its default automatic


757
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:28,246
position.


758
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:31,266
And this works on iPad too.


759
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:34,016
A couple of things to keep in


760
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:34,946
mind about the way the table


761
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:36,056
views interact with the safe


762
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:38,036
area; those automatic separator


763
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:39,646
insets are relative to the safe


764
00:22:39,646 --> 00:22:40,396
area insets.


765
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,476
So by default the entire content


766
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:44,026
of your table view avoids the


767
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:45,346
safe area insets from its


768
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:46,556
ancestor view controllers.


769
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,656
UI table view cell and UI table


770
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:50,966
view header/footer view, which


771
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,076
might be one of the longer names


772
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,936
in the kit, they both have a


773
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,236
content view property.


774
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:56,256
That's where you should be


775
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,456
adding your sub-views.


776
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,636
Both of these classes make sure


777
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,526
that that content view also


778
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,156
avoids the safe area insets.


779
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:05,206
So you should be using UI table


780
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:07,176
view header/footer view for all


781
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,156
of the headers and footers in


782
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:09,896
your table views; table headers


783
00:23:09,896 --> 00:23:11,726
and footers and section headers


784
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:14,196
and footers.


785
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:15,496
We've also brought over the


786
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:17,296
really rich swipe action


787
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,586
functionality from the mail


788
00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:20,776
application to your


789
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:21,476
applications.


790
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:24,176
So on iOS 11 your applications


791
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:25,426
will get the new swipe action


792
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:27,596
look and feel by default, and if


793
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:30,256
you link against iOS 11, you can


794
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:31,636
get full swipe to delete


795
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:32,986
behavior, just like you're used


796
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:33,786
to from the mail app.


797
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:35,306
And if you go ahead --


798
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:36,616
[applause] some people are very


799
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:37,516
excited about this I know.


800
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:39,836
[applause] And if you go ahead


801
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,736
and adopt a few new APIs you can


802
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:43,026
get some really cool features,


803
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:44,736
like images in your swipe


804
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:46,736
actions, or swipe actions from


805
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:47,876
both the leading and the


806
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,646
trailing edges, or a completion


807
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:51,936
handler that lets you cancel the


808
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:52,606
swipe action.


809
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,286
And to show us how to adopt all


810
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:55,886
these features in our


811
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,236
application, Raj is going to


812
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:57,926
come up and give us another


813
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:58,216
demo.


814
00:23:58,406 --> 00:23:58,706
Raj?


815
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:05,906
[ Applause ]


816
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:06,936
>> Thanks Kyle.


817
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:08,576
So we're going to switch over to


818
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:10,506
the demo machine again and as


819
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,136
you can see we've got these big


820
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:13,286
beautiful bars in this new


821
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:13,936
application.


822
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,216
It's looking really great.


823
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:17,116
But I want to show you the


824
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:18,106
comments view controller.


825
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:19,646
Now if I push into the comments


826
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:21,216
view controller here, you'll


827
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:22,266
notice we have some really


828
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,636
interesting comments and we've


829
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,046
got all the comments here in a


830
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,216
comment bar at the bottom.


831
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:29,586
Now our users have been asking


832
00:24:29,586 --> 00:24:31,466
us for one thing and that's time


833
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:31,876
stamps.


834
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,776
And so I went and spoke to our


835
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:35,366
designer and got this really


836
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:37,086
cool design for this awesome new


837
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:37,736
scroll bar.


838
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,376
This scroll bar also indicates,


839
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,506
not only where you are in the


840
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,446
comments view, but also the time


841
00:24:44,446 --> 00:24:45,776
stamp where it's pointing.


842
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,146
So let's go ahead and implement


843
00:24:48,146 --> 00:24:48,346
that.


844
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,606
I'll switch over to the comments


845
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:52,456
view controller and create our


846
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:54,426
scroll bar using a method I


847
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,086
wrote earlier.


848
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:58,176
And when I recompile and rerun


849
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:02,026
the application, scroll down,


850
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:05,656
tap on one of these cells, and


851
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:06,346
into the comments view


852
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:07,936
controller you'll see there it


853
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:08,636
is.


854
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:09,776
So it's looking pretty cool.


855
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,116
It shows you where you are in


856
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:12,296
this comments view controller


857
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:15,436
and the time stamp of the cell


858
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:17,456
that it's pointing at.


859
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:19,776
But, as you might notice, there


860
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:20,606
are a few issues here.


861
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:22,906
The first issue is that this


862
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:24,716
indicator actually overlaps with


863
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:26,306
the table view cell a little bit


864
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:27,466
and so it makes things maybe a


865
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:28,346
little bit hard to read.


866
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:30,886
The second thing is that this


867
00:25:30,936 --> 00:25:32,116
indicator overlaps with this


868
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:33,496
input field here at the bottom.


869
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:36,386
So let's use some new APIs in


870
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:37,856
iOS 11 to help solve these


871
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:38,276
problems.


872
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,596
We're going to use the


873
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,146
additional safe area insets


874
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:44,586
property on UI view controller


875
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,706
to help solve this.


876
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:47,766
So I'll go ahead and unwrap our


877
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:49,956
two views and I'll set our


878
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:51,576
additional safe area insets to a


879
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:52,996
UA edge insets.


880
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,066
So on the top we don't have


881
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:57,136
anything additional to add.


882
00:25:57,996 --> 00:25:59,376
On the left that's the same


883
00:25:59,376 --> 00:25:59,796
story.


884
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:01,976
On the bottom we want to make it


885
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,096
the comment bar's size.


886
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,456
So we'll get the height of the


887
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:07,726
comment bar and on the right we


888
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:08,636
have a property that I've


889
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:10,286
written earlier on the side


890
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:12,516
indicator that gives its


891
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:13,376
preferred width.


892
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,106
So now we've set up our


893
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:17,406
additional safe area insets.


894
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,676
If I recompile and rerun the


895
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:23,846
application, head into the


896
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,316
detail view and again into the


897
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:26,806
comments view controller, you'll


898
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:27,896
notice things are starting to


899
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:28,756
look pretty good.


900
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:31,176
We've got our content inset from


901
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:33,656
the right edge and the scroll


902
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:35,146
indicator's also inset from the


903
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:37,416
bottom edge, but you'll notice


904
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,356
here, down at the bottom, that


905
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:42,406
this comment field actually is


906
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:43,726
inset a little bit from the


907
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:44,646
right edge of the screen.


908
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:48,526
So the reason for that is the


909
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:51,306
comment field's text field is


910
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:53,056
constrained to its super views


911
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:54,046
layout margins.


912
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:57,076
Now in iOS 11 your layout


913
00:26:57,076 --> 00:26:59,046
margins are actually inset from


914
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:01,286
the safe area and because we


915
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,686
added additional safe area


916
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:04,506
insets on the right of this view


917
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:06,316
our layout margins get inset


918
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:06,896
accordingly.


919
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,206
Now most of the time this is


920
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:10,376
going to be exactly what you


921
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:12,476
want, but we do have a property


922
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:14,736
on UI view, "insets layout


923
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:16,746
margins from safe area," which


924
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:17,896
lets you control this property.


925
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:20,236
So for this use case let's go


926
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:20,966
ahead and set that to "false."


927
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:27,836
When I go ahead and do that,


928
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:30,166
recompile and rerun the


929
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:33,906
application, go back into the


930
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:35,256
detail view controller and


931
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,186
finally into the comments view


932
00:27:36,186 --> 00:27:38,056
controller, you'll see things


933
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:38,896
are starting to look really


934
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:39,156
good.


935
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:40,916
We've got our content at the


936
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:41,726
right spot.


937
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:42,836
We've got our beautiful new


938
00:27:42,836 --> 00:27:43,626
scroll indicator.


939
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:45,896
Everything is inset and the


940
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,296
comment field is a full width.


941
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:50,816
Awesome! The next thing I'd like


942
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:53,006
to show you is adding swipe


943
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,436
actions to this application.


944
00:27:55,236 --> 00:27:57,136
So I've decided that I'd like to


945
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:59,216
add the ability to favorite and


946
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:00,126
maybe delete some of these


947
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:00,386
things.


948
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:03,306
So let's go to the memory view


949
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:06,266
controller and add support for


950
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,296
the new swipe actions in iOS 11.


951
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:12,256
So it looks like a lot, but I'll


952
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:12,946
walk you through it.


953
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:15,366
All I've done is implemented two


954
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:17,296
new methods; leading swipe


955
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:18,736
actions configuration for road


956
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,296
indexpath and trailing swipe


957
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:21,646
actions configurations for road


958
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:22,196
indexpath.


959
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:23,646
So let's walk through the


960
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:24,186
leading one.


961
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:26,286
All I do is I create a UI


962
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:27,786
contextual action here, with a


963
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:29,266
style of "normal," a title of


964
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:31,096
"favorite," and a block based


965
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:31,516
handler.


966
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:34,056
I update our favorites state,


967
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,536
using a method I wrote earlier,


968
00:28:35,536 --> 00:28:37,046
and then I call the completion


969
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:39,146
handler with the parameter of


970
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:40,016
"true."


971
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:41,326
Just so everything's looking


972
00:28:41,326 --> 00:28:42,856
right, I'll also set it to


973
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,246
"unfavorite," based on whether


974
00:28:44,246 --> 00:28:45,476
that item's already favorited.


975
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,586
And then I'll set the image to


976
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:49,926
this beautiful star that I had


977
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,026
made earlier and the background


978
00:28:52,026 --> 00:28:53,356
color to this awesome looking


979
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:53,776
orange.


980
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,106
And then all I need to do is


981
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:57,296
create a UI swipe actions


982
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:59,216
configuration using that UI


983
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:00,966
contextual action and return it.


984
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:03,496
The story's pretty much the same


985
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,046
for the trailing actions; I just


986
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,406
use the style of disruptive.


987
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:08,916
So when I recompile and rerun


988
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:13,716
this time, go back over, and


989
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:15,386
swipe, you'll notice we get this


990
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:17,606
option swipe actions and you can


991
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:18,706
even have a swipe action on the


992
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:19,976
leading edge, as you see here,


993
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:21,156
which you were never able to do


994
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:21,456
before.


995
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:24,456
For full -- furthermore, you get


996
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:26,036
full swipe to delete support out


997
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:27,046
of the box.


998
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,166
So all I need to do is swipe all


999
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,596
the way across and it just


1000
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:30,976
works.

[ Applause ]


1002
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,436
So that's a look at some of the


1003
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:40,676
new APIs for margins, insets,


1004
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:42,996
scroll views, and bars in this


1005
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:43,466
demo app.


1006
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:44,726
It's looking really great and


1007
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:46,026
definitely ready for iOS 11.


1008
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:47,736
Now Kyle's going to come back up


1009
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:48,726
to tell you about some related


1010
00:29:48,726 --> 00:29:48,976
sessions.

>> Thank you again Raj.


1013
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:00,456
So just to recap what we've


1014
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:02,026
learned today; we've learned how


1015
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:03,716
to adopt large navigation titles


1016
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,076
and the new integrated search


1017
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:06,706
experience into our applications


1018
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:07,616
for iOS 11.


1019
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,516
We've also learned about some


1020
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:11,936
new improvements to layout


1021
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,296
margins that give us complete


1022
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:15,686
control over our views and the


1023
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:17,616
way they layout, as well as a


1024
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,826
new concept called the safe


1025
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:20,206
area, which tells us about


1026
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:22,006
overlapping contents and things


1027
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,376
like over scan compensation


1028
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:24,446
insets on Apple TV.


1029
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:27,046
We've learned about some new


1030
00:30:27,046 --> 00:30:28,476
enhancements to UI scroll view


1031
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,276
that give us better control over


1032
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:32,456
our content inset and some new


1033
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,286
features in UI table view and


1034
00:30:34,286 --> 00:30:35,526
how it interacts with concepts


1035
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,636
like the safe area.


1036
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:40,096

1037
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,436
