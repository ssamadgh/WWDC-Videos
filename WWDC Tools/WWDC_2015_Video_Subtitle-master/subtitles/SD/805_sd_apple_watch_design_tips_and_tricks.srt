00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,171

2
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:32,066
>> MIKE STERN: Hello, everyone.


3
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:36,656
My name is Mike Stern.


4
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,956
I am a User Experience
Evangelist at Apple,


5
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,646
and it's a pleasure to
be with you here today.


6
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:44,576
So today's session is about
designing for Apple Watch,


7
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:46,886
and in particular we are going
to talk about tips and tricks


8
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:48,476
about how you can do that.


9
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:51,246
Now, on Wednesday I
gave a different talk


10
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:56,086
on the same topic, but it had a
bit of a different nature to it.


11
00:00:56,086 --> 00:01:00,036
And for those of you who weren't
here for that, it's okay.


12
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:01,336
I'm not totally hurt.


13
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,825
But I do want to bring you
up to speed a little bit.


14
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,956
So there were three key
themes for that presentation


15
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:09,396
that I'll review very briefly.


16
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:13,946
Those three themes were Personal
Communication, Holistic Design,


17
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,496
and Lightweight Interaction.


18
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,516
Personal Communication
involves taking what we know


19
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:23,116
about positive and effective
interpersonal communication


20
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:25,016
and using that as a model


21
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,606
for how we design
apps for Apple Watch.


22
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:32,456
Now, interactions on Apple
Watch create a more intimate


23
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:36,006
and personal experience with
technology, and it's important


24
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:39,776
that the apps that you design
for Apple Watch take advantage


25
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:44,136
of that and feel more
intimate and personal as well.


26
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:46,756
Holistic Design is about
blurring the boundary


27
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:49,536
between software and
hardware, and that could be


28
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:52,116
through the visual design
of your app's interface


29
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:54,246
and allowing it to
seamlessly blend


30
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,716
in with the Apple Watch bezel.


31
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,866
It's about harnessing
the capabilities


32
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:01,476
of the Force Touch display
and using it properly.


33
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,746
Same thing with the
Digital Crown.


34
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,196
And the Taptic Engine,
especially now


35
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,455
that we have haptic feedback.


36
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:14,136
You can use these things
to create a more immersive,


37
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,716
sophisticated, and
nuanced experience


38
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:18,746
for the people who
use your apps.


39
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:24,076
And Lightweight Interaction is
about designing for quick looks


40
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:25,536
and fast interactions.


41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,406
It's about taking advantage


42
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,496
of the Watch's unique
position on the user's wrist.


43
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:35,496
So together, these three
themes are the foundation upon


44
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:39,036
which you can design really
great apps, notifications,


45
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,736
and glances for Apple Watch.


46
00:02:41,396 --> 00:02:44,076
And everything we are going
to talk about today relates


47
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:47,296
in some way, some shape or
form, to these three themes.


48
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,936
But this talk is a
little bit different.


49
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,576
Now, in today's presentation,
we are just not going


50
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:55,686
to recycle the things that
we talked about earlier;


51
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:58,836
we are going to get down to the
specifics, the nuts and bolts,


52
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,526
the brass tacks about how


53
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:02,926
to make really great
Apple Watch apps,


54
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,746
notifications, and glances.


55
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,536
And we are going to
do that by talking


56
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:11,526
about the top 10 common pitfalls
that we've seen developers run


57
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,566
into when designing
for Apple Watch.


58
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:18,796
Now, Apple Watch is a new
type of device for Apple,


59
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:22,206
and you know, even for someone
like me, I've never designed


60
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:23,986
for a wearable device, so a lot


61
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,186
of things are a little bit
counterintuitive or new.


62
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,866
So we see these kind
of common missteps.


63
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,586
So there's no issue with
that, but we want to talk


64
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,376
about these things we've
learned along the way.


65
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,286
Does that sound like
a good thing?


66
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:38,076
Are you guys on board with that?


67
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:38,276
[Applause] Yeah?


68
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:39,146
All right.


69
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,446
Cool. Great.


70
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,476
I am really fired up
to talk about this,


71
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:44,656
so without further ado,


72
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:48,576
let's get into the number one
common pitfall, and that's --


73
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:55,486
[Laughter] -- and that is not
a very good user experience.


74
00:03:56,286 --> 00:04:00,716
The number one common pitfall
that we've seen are slow apps.


75
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:04,146
Apple Watch is all
about convenience,


76
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:08,406
so if your app takes too long
to install, or it takes too long


77
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,996
to launch, or pages
take too long to load,


78
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:13,836
that's not very convenient
for people at all; right?


79
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,596
The design of your app's UI


80
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,685
and how you produce graphics
can have a huge impact


81
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,536
on the performance of your app.


82
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:24,786
You want to design
for performance.


83
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:27,936
So whenever possible,
for example,


84
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:30,696
you want to use progressive
loading of pages,


85
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:34,076
and that simply means that you
don't need to make people wait


86
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:36,416
for all of the content
to be ready to display


87
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,166
on a page before you let
them go to that page.


88
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,876
You can bring them to the
page, show a few things,


89
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:44,766
and then show the rest of the
stuff as it becomes available.


90
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,966
You know, seeing this
is pretty disappointing.


91
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:49,606
We want to avoid this.


92
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:52,316
When someone taps a button to
load a new page or they swipe


93
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:54,936
to it, they should get
to that page immediately.


94
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:56,846
It's a reasonable expectation.


95
00:04:57,956 --> 00:04:59,146
So let's look at an example.


96
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:00,296
Let's say we have an app


97
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,396
that simply lists nearby
Apple retail locations.


98
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:08,426
Now, on this screen, we have
a list of all those stores,


99
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:10,486
we have the store name,
we have the address,


100
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:13,266
and we have the distance
from our current location.


101
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,506
Now, all of this information
is going to be present


102
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:20,096
on the detail screen for each of
these stores, so we have a lot


103
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:23,146
of data that's already ready
and stored locally on the watch.


104
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:26,456
So when we go to that page,
we already have a bunch


105
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:27,556
of content to display.


106
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:31,346
Other things, like the store
hours or maybe a description


107
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:33,986
about how to get to the store,
it's all text and it's going


108
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:34,896
to load pretty quickly.


109
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:38,856
Now, perhaps there's also
a photo of this store.


110
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:41,486
We didn't need to
make users wait


111
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:45,996
around until we had the photo on
the Watch just to draw the page.


112
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,426
In fact, it's better
to let people go


113
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:51,986
to the detail page first so they
could see specifically what it


114
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:53,726
is that they would
have been waiting for.


115
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:57,506
I mean, by showing
a photo label,


116
00:05:57,506 --> 00:06:00,766
these labels here make it very
specific about what remains


117
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,216
to be loaded into the page.


118
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,166
And people might not be
interested in looking at photos


119
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,286
at all of the store,
and if that's the case,


120
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:10,036
they have access to the other
information on the page.


121
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:11,516
They can get that
and then leave.


122
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:15,306
Now, if you use progressive
loading like this,


123
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,006
you want to make sure that
you hold open the space


124
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:19,676
for the things that
will eventually load


125
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:22,046
in by using placeholder
graphics.


126
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:25,596
The reason for that is when
things eventually draw in,


127
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,806
you don't want the height
of the page to change


128
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:31,206
because if you were looking at
something like below the photo,


129
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:33,626
all of a sudden it
would jump out of view.


130
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,726
It actually, I guess,
would go down lower.


131
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,236
And that's very disorienting,
so you've got


132
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:40,356
to hold the space open.


133
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,636
Now, if you use this
technique, you should also think


134
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,216
about the way that you've
ordered content onto the page.


135
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:48,456
You want to put things that
are likely to take longer


136
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,656
to load further down
on the page.


137
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:55,156
So with that photo offscreen,
there's going to be more time


138
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:59,066
for it to load in before the
user actually scrolls to see it.


139
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,556
They may never realize that
it wasn't present onscreen


140
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,306
when they had first
gotten to this page.


141
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:08,796
Now the next way to
design for performance is


142
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:10,516
to optimize your graphics.


143
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,596
And the best way to do that
is through compression.


144
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:16,896
When you are producing
graphics, it's important


145
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:20,646
to pick the right compressions
type and use the right settings.


146
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,936
So for example, with photos,


147
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:24,616
most of the time you
are going to use JPEG.


148
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:27,466
JPEG is what we call
a lossy format,


149
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,146
meaning whenever you save
a JPEG, there's some loss


150
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:33,256
to the visual quality or
fidelity of the image.


151
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:35,956
But with moderate
compression, that's okay.


152
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,146
It may not really affect the
perceived quality of the image.


153
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:42,226
Let's say we are going to
compress this photo here.


154
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:45,376
It's kind of blown up, so
it looks a little pixilated.


155
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:47,296
Let's compress this photo.


156
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,356
At the highest quality
setting for JPEG,


157
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:53,126
it's going to take about 125 K.


158
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:57,846
As we lower the quality setting,
we see that the file size starts


159
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:59,586
to drop off pretty dramatically.


160
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,456
At the highest compression
setting,


161
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:05,356
the lowest quality setting,
it's just about 25 K,


162
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:08,016
or about 20 percent of
the highest-quality image.


163
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:11,636
That's a pretty big file
size savings, but it's going


164
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:13,056
to look pretty terrible there.


165
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,946
Usually when you are
compressing JPEGs,


166
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:16,886
you want to find
somewhere in the middle.


167
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,536
As you can see, we
sort of hit a point


168
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:20,956
of diminishing returns anyway.


169
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:24,696
So let's look at how these
compare side by side.


170
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,926
It's pretty hard to tell that
there's actually any difference


171
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:29,496
in quality whatsoever, and


172
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,846
yet we've saved two-thirds
of the file size.


173
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:35,666
You can only really see those
visual artifacts of compression


174
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,586
when you look up close.


175
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:41,135
But that's not how people
experience these images.


176
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,395
That's not how we take them in.


177
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,896
They look at it on a very
high-resolution Retina display


178
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:48,906
on a device that is kind
of constantly moving


179
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:51,136
around a little bit because
it's strapped to their wrist.


180
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:53,776
So it's hard for people
to see those artifacts.


181
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:56,486
Next, let's talk about PNGs.


182
00:08:57,646 --> 00:09:00,596
Now, PNGs are basically the
way most other graphics other


183
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:04,616
than photos are displayed on
most apps, and by default,


184
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:08,426
PNGs use a 24-bit color
palette, which basically means


185
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:10,776
that there's millions of colors
that are at your disposal


186
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,546
for drawing the artwork
in the graphic.


187
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:16,946
But for most graphics like this
icon, that's way more color


188
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,136
than you actually need.


189
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:21,266
So when you save out your
PNGs, you should be aware


190
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:23,626
that there's also an 8-bit
color palette setting


191
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:24,906
that you can use.


192
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:29,766
That just means that you
have 256 colors or less


193
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,566
to draw your images,
but for this graphic,


194
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,496
it's more than enough.


195
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:37,776
In fact, it's only at around
200 colors or less that we start


196
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:40,896
to notice any kind of dithering
or posterization of our artwork.


197
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,956
You want to be really frugal


198
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:46,156
with file-size settings
by using 8-bit pings.


199
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:50,246
As you can see here, the
file size savings are


200
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,366
really tremendous.


201
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:54,746
It's almost a tenfold
decrease in file size.


202
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:59,026
Again, there's no discernible
difference in quality.


203
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,006
When your app has
a lot of graphics,


204
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:05,026
the overall file size savings
can be really tremendous,


205
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:08,156
especially when you have image
sequences for animations.


206
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:11,986
It can lead to significantly
smaller sizes for your apps.


207
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:14,806
So it's important to take
this stuff seriously.


208
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:18,736
Now, next you want to
avoid using transparency


209
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:19,986
when it isn't necessary.


210
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:22,346
Transparency requires
alpha channels,


211
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:24,676
and alpha channels
take up file size.


212
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:26,986
So avoid those unless
you actually need it.


213
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:29,606
Now, sometimes you
do need transparency.


214
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:32,616
For example, this graphic
for the Weather glance,


215
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:36,856
it's composited against a
translucent dark background


216
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,106
that blurs the watch
face behind it.


217
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,636
Because of that, you
need transparency to let


218
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:43,396
that color information
come through.


219
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,306
But a similar icon for the
Weather app doesn't need it.


220
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:50,126
It's always composited
against a black background.


221
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,096
So we can just assume and bake
in that black matte background


222
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:57,296
and not have an alpha
channel at all.


223
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,336
Okay. Now, the last
main technique


224
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:03,486
for optimizing graphics
is to just make graphics


225
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:05,656
at the size you actually
need them.


226
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,286
And this is especially
true when you are sending


227
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:10,036
over graphics at runtime.


228
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,206
There is no sense in sending
over a larger graphic or video


229
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,346
than what you actually need
to display on the Watch,


230
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:20,886
and that's especially true if
portions of it are just going


231
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:22,366
to get cropped out anyway.


232
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:25,276
So make sure images and
videos are the right size.


233
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,336
Okay. So designing


234
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:30,016
for performance means
progressively loading content


235
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:30,486
on pages.


236
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,106
It means ordering things


237
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:35,006
so people don't realize you are
progressively loading content,


238
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:38,546
and optimizing graphics through
compression, no transparency,


239
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:41,726
and using the correctly
sized graphics.


240
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:43,536
Now, for more information,


241
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,506
I recommend watching the
video for this session.


242
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:48,516
There's lot of great, a little
bit more engineering-focused


243
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:51,376
tips and tricks about how
to optimize for performance.


244
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:55,016
Now, there's another
really good technique


245
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,956
for optimizing the
performance of your apps,


246
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,976
and I'd like to share
it with you now.


247
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:02,646
It's a really, really good one,


248
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:06,566
and it involves not
making complex apps.


249
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:08,506
Common pitfall number two.


250
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,796
Now, a little bit earlier
I said I wasn't just going


251
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,846
to recycle content from
my earlier presentation.


252
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,766
That's a little bit of a fib


253
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,216
because I am going
to do that a bit.


254
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:20,806
Apple Watch is not
a miniature iPhone.


255
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,746
This is so important that
I want to say this twice.


256
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:27,486
We've seen developers do this
time and time again, and again,


257
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:29,936
it's a natural thing to
try to take our assumptions


258
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:33,066
and processes for making
apps from iPhone and apply it


259
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,746
to Watch, but it winds up with
apps that are difficult to use


260
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,926
and difficult to navigate.


261
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:42,076
Apple Watch is ideally
suited for quick looks,


262
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:45,546
for convenience, and
brief interactions.


263
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:50,316
So what information and actions
do people really want quick


264
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,836
access and convenient
access to from your iOS app?


265
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:57,116
Make sure that you
focus on the essentials.


266
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,426
Don't overload your app
with too much information


267
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,286
or functionality.


268
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:04,816
This is really a recipe for
poor usability on Apple Watch.


269
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,576
So for example, the Calendar
app on the iPhone does all sorts


270
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:12,036
of things that the Apple
Watch Xalendar app does not.


271
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,996
You can't search in the
Calendar app on Apple Watch.


272
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:17,446
You can't add events.


273
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,946
You can't manage your calendars.


274
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:23,316
And you can't see nearly
as far into the future


275
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,686
or into the past at all.


276
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:30,006
Calendar on Apple Watch
is just a small subset


277
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,676
of the overall functionality of
what you can do on the iPhone,


278
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:35,416
but it's the things that
make sense for the Watch.


279
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,306
Right? You can check your
calendar, what's going on today


280
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,606
and what's happening
in the next few days.


281
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:42,796
You can get a little
bit of detail about each


282
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:43,986
of the events in your calendar.


283
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,076
You can accept, you can
decline invitations,


284
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,526
you can contact the organizer
in case you are running late


285
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:50,376
or you need to cancel
the meeting.


286
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:53,746
This is the things that
make sense on the Watch.


287
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:56,526
Not all of the other stuff
that you can do on your iPhone.


288
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:01,286
Apple Watch apps should
complement your iPhone app.


289
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:02,916
As we just saw with
Calendar, that could be


290
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,856
by providing a small subset
of the overall functionality


291
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,636
from your iPhone on Apple Watch,


292
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:12,356
or it could be extending the
capabilities of your iOS app.


293
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:15,686
So for example, the Camera app


294
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:20,206
for Apple Watch turns Apple
Watch into a viewfinder


295
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:23,916
for Camera on your
iPhone, which allows you


296
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,606
to set your iPhone far away from
you, take a picture of yourself,


297
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:29,766
friends from a distance,
and make sure


298
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:32,076
that everyone's in the frame.


299
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:35,656
It's extending the experience
of the Camera app on iOS.


300
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:37,606
Now, I challenge you to think


301
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:39,816
about how you can
do a similar thing


302
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,966
for your apps with Apple Watch.


303
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,956
How can you extend the
experience of your apps in ways


304
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:46,486
that were not previously
possible?


305
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:52,686
Okay. Common pitfall number
three is tedious navigation.


306
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:56,826
Tedious navigation is the
result of inefficiencies


307
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:59,656
in the user flow that
makes it harder for people


308
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,996
to find what it is that
they're actually looking for.


309
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,286
Now, tedious navigation
often results


310
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:08,256
from choosing the wrong
structural model for your app.


311
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:14,806
There are two structural models,
two core ones, for Apple Watch.


312
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,286
The first one is a
page-based model,


313
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:20,876
and here we just have a series
of pages that are sort of side


314
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:23,246
by side with each other and
you swipe to go between them.


315
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,456
That's the model
that Weather uses.


316
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:28,396
You swipe from city to city.


317
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:33,616
The other structural model
is a hierarchical model,


318
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,316
and in a hierarchical model,
you have a high-level set


319
00:15:36,316 --> 00:15:40,206
of categories or content
summaries, and then you tap one


320
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,116
to go to more detailed
information


321
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,786
or more specific functionality.


322
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:47,356
Stocks is an example
of a hierarchical app.


323
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:50,876
At the top level, we have a
list of stocks and markets,


324
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:53,876
and if we tap on one of these,
it pushes on a child view


325
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:57,266
with more specific information
on the item we selected.


326
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,896
In watchOS, it's not possible


327
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:03,006
to mix these models
with each other.


328
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,526
So you can't start
with a page-based model


329
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:07,476
and then transition


330
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:10,206
to a hierarchical
one at lower levels.


331
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:14,746
And conversely, you can't start
with hierarchy and transition


332
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:16,806
to a page-based model
at lower levels.


333
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,156
The reason for this is
because of screen size.


334
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:25,196
To explain why, let's
look at this child view


335
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:26,846
in a hierarchical app.


336
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,756
So I just highlighted that
little chevron or back arrow


337
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,686
in the top-left corner, and
that's your way of getting back


338
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:34,806
up to the parent view
if you tap that button.


339
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:38,976
But it's a pretty small tap
target, and the hit area


340
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:41,386
for it is not very well defined.


341
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,056
It's a little bit
definitely bigger


342
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:44,936
than the arrow, but not much.


343
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,896
So to make it easier
for people to get back


344
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:50,206
up to the parent view,
you can also swipe


345
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,226
in from the left
edge of the screen.


346
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:55,126
And that will help
you transition back


347
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:56,506
up to the parent
view, as we see here.


348
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,866
Now, the trouble is
in a page-based app,


349
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,185
very similar gestures how you
go to the previous screen.


350
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:07,876
And because the Watch
display size is pretty small,


351
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,276
it's difficult to support both


352
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,445
of those gestures
simultaneously.


353
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:16,516
So you must decide which
model is best for your app.


354
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:20,476
The structure that you choose
should obviously make it easy


355
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:23,465
for people to find what it is
that they are looking for with


356
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,856
as few swipes or
taps as necessary.


357
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,086
Now, usually deciding
between hierarchy


358
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,916
or a page-based structure comes
down to the number of screens


359
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,546
that are in your app and
the type of information


360
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:35,376
that you are displaying.


361
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,296
So a page-based structure
works best


362
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:40,736
when you are showing a flat
collection of information


363
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,386
in which all of the
items are peers,


364
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,596
and page-based apps shouldn't
have too many screens


365
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:50,076
because swiping between them
is a relatively slow way


366
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:51,476
to browse through content.


367
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,266
So Weather meets both
of these criteria.


368
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:58,036
Most people only want to check
the weather for a few cities,


369
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,106
so you don't have
too many items,


370
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,446
and it doesn't feel
cumbersome that you have


371
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,896
to swipe between them.


372
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,636
When it comes to understanding
weather conditions,


373
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:07,456
all cities are basically equal.


374
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,226
There is no need to organize


375
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,286
or categorize them
on some higher level.


376
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,736
On the other hand, hierarchical
apps are better for larger


377
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:18,016
or more complex data structures.


378
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:22,086
People may use the Stocks
app to track dozens of stocks


379
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:23,656
and markets at the same time.


380
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:27,566
By using a top-level list,
navigating to any one


381
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,816
of those individual stocks or
markets is really easy to do.


382
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:32,456
You just scroll the screen,


383
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:35,406
find the one you are
looking for, and select it.


384
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:39,496
Now, the other cool thing
about this is there's a ton


385
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,466
of really useful information
just at this level.


386
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,516
So people may get all of the
information they actually need


387
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,726
without even needing
to navigate at all.


388
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,806
That's really efficient.


389
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:55,266
Okay. So, now just imagine
if we had designed this


390
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,566
as being a paginated
or page-based app.


391
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:01,156
It would take people forever to
get through all of the stocks


392
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:03,466
to go from -- to find the
one that they are looking


393
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,086
for if it was really far away.


394
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:08,156
And hopefully they would start
swiping in the right direction


395
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:10,286
because if they didn't,
they'd have to double back


396
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:12,396
and go all the way
back to the beginning.


397
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,296
Choosing the right model
is really important.


398
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,816
Tedious navigation
can also result


399
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:20,436
from overusing modal sheets.


400
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:25,336
Now, modal sheets support
paging through multiple views,


401
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,296
and I've seen people try to
get around this limitation


402
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,906
of not being able
to go from hierarchy


403
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:33,836
to page-based structures by
using modal sheets instead.


404
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:37,316
Now, this is something that I
would strongly advise against.


405
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,416
First of all, modal sheets
don't display the time,


406
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,026
and we think it's pretty
important that most


407
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:45,626
of the time people can see
the time on their Apple Watch.


408
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:49,916
And the animation of a modal
sheet sliding up is meant


409
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,106
to be a bit disruptive.


410
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:54,546
It's like this separate pane
of information, which slides


411
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:56,546
up over the main
interface and takes people


412
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,176
out of the main app experience.


413
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:00,546
It's meant to signal
a departure.


414
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:02,726
It should feel a
little bit disruptive.


415
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:05,696
So if a primary aspect of
the way people navigate


416
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:08,216
in your app causes these
modal sheet animations


417
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:09,386
to occur all the time,


418
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:12,176
the overall experience is
not going to feel very fluid.


419
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:15,106
It will feel jarring,
disjointed.


420
00:20:16,586 --> 00:20:18,576
Now, another thing
related to modal sheets


421
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,536
and tedious navigation,
is you don't want


422
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:23,056
to have too many
modal sheets sliding


423
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,486
up over each other
or back to back.


424
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:27,256
This is the same thing on iOS.


425
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:29,996
People will start to
feel like they are lost


426
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,226
in this modal experience
that never ends,


427
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:36,056
and they will have difficulty
or feel like it's difficult


428
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:39,006
to get back to the main
experience of your app.


429
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,966
Now, regardless of what
structure you choose,


430
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:44,016
it's important to
keep it simple.


431
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:47,666
So in a hierarchical app,
you shouldn't have more


432
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:51,016
than two levels of
hierarchy, three at the most.


433
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,026
Anything more than
that, and it's going


434
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:54,156
to take people a long time


435
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:55,536
to find the things
they are interested in,


436
00:20:55,536 --> 00:20:58,896
and they will start to feel
lost in your hierarchy.


437
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:02,486
And with page-based apps,
as I was suggesting before,


438
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,546
avoid having too many pages.


439
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:07,646
Again, swiping through all of
these pages will take a lot


440
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,336
of time and feel really tedious.


441
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:14,006
Tedious navigation is really
inefficient navigation.


442
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,546
And there's that design
principle I was talking


443
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,706
about earlier, Lightweight
Interaction.


444
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:20,566
Lightweight Interaction
is really all


445
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:24,976
about efficient navigation, or a
big aspect of it is efficiency.


446
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:32,036
So moving on, the fourth common
pitfall is confusing labels.


447
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:37,296
Now, what I am talking about
here is mostly about page titles


448
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,196
and the Close buttons or Dismiss
buttons for modal sheets.


449
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,256
Let's start with page titles.


450
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,616
Now, a common misconception
is that in a hierarchical app,


451
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:50,026
the title there where it says Do
Not Disturb on the right side,


452
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:53,256
that that's actually a Back
button or Back button label


453
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:54,886
and not a title for
the current view.


454
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:57,376
But that's not really the case.


455
00:21:58,496 --> 00:22:00,416
If we were to use it
as such, we would wind


456
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,316
up having multiple screens
that share the same title,


457
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:05,616
and at a quick glance,
they both are supposed


458
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,616
to look like titles.


459
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:09,176
So you should really
avoid doing this.


460
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:13,836
Now, I understand
why people do it.


461
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,576
This is also wrong
for the same reason.


462
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,676
It's not a Back button,


463
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:20,536
so please don't have
Back here instead.


464
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:25,006
So as I said, I got
ahead of myself.


465
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:27,476
I understand why people
treat it as a Back button


466
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,816
because it originally
resembles a Back button


467
00:22:30,236 --> 00:22:31,876
from an iPhone or an iPad.


468
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:35,276
But on the iPhone or
an iPad, you have space


469
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:38,736
to show both the Back button
and a title at the same time.


470
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,076
Now, in Apple Watch, the
display is much smaller,


471
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,236
so you can't show both.


472
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:45,836
It would be kind of ridiculous.


473
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:49,856
So you have to choose which
one to show, and ultimately,


474
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,956
showing a title is
more important


475
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,186
than showing a Back button.


476
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:55,466
It's more important that people
know what they are currently


477
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:56,786
looking at than what's


478
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:59,326
on the previous screen
or the parent screen.


479
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:04,066
Now, the other common
misconception when it comes


480
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:07,326
to labels relates to
modal sheet Close buttons


481
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:08,926
or Dismiss buttons.


482
00:23:09,716 --> 00:23:11,726
Now, these can be
renamed because,


483
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:14,266
instead of saying Dismiss,
it might be more natural


484
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:17,896
to say Close, or
Done, or Cancel.


485
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:22,496
But however you rename it, it
needs to be clear to people


486
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,636
that these are actionable.


487
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,756
People need to realize that
they can tap that label


488
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:27,676
and it's going to do something.


489
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,536
And not just do anything.


490
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,856
It's actually going to close the
modal sheet and take them back


491
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,146
to the previous screen.


492
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,456
So you don't want to
do something like this,


493
00:23:36,736 --> 00:23:38,246
where you just use
it as a title,


494
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:40,166
because then people are
not going to realize


495
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:42,776
that it's actionable, and they
are going to hunt around and try


496
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:44,126
to figure out how they
are actually going


497
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:45,566
to close the modal
sheet and be stuck


498
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,566
in this screen for too long.


499
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:53,266
And for a variety of reasons,
please, please do not do this.


500
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,576
Right? As I said before,
even in a hierarchical app,


501
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:59,526
you shouldn't treat
this as a Back button.


502
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:01,726
So this is just putting
an angle bracket


503
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:03,026
and the word Back in here.


504
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,146
But this is going to be
confusing for people.


505
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:07,346
First of all, modal sheets
slide up from the bottom


506
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,056
of the screen, they don't
slide in from the right,


507
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:12,656
and you can't use the left-edge
swipe to get back out of here.


508
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:15,456
This is really confusing for
people when they see this.


509
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:21,706
Okay. Now, the fifth next major
common pitfall that we have seen


510
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:24,866
on Apple Watch is
using the menu control


511
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:28,036
for primary navigation
in your app.


512
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:30,806
Now, menus like this one
for Messages are really good


513
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:34,516
for contextual actions,
like making a new message.


514
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:37,976
Or for view mode preferences,
like this one for Calendar


515
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,596
for switching the visual
appearance of your schedule.


516
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:45,806
But when you try to use a menu
for navigation, it causes a lot


517
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:47,076
of usability problems.


518
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:51,326
The main one is that people
just don't know where they are


519
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:54,136
in your app structure or
even that they can navigate.


520
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:57,126
So for example, in
a hierarchical app,


521
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:00,146
that arrow there serves a
really important purpose.


522
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,666
It lets people know about
what the structure is


523
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,696
of the app that they are in.


524
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:07,826
It lets people know that they
are in a hierarchical app.


525
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:11,026
More than that, it lets people
know they are in a child view


526
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:14,936
so they can go back up to access
the navigation for the app.


527
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,096
That's pretty important,


528
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:19,506
that's a pretty fundamental
thing for people to know.


529
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:24,176
Similarly, in a page-based
app, those dots at the bottom


530
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:26,686
of the screen tell
people that they're


531
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:28,206
in a page-based structure.


532
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:31,956
And it tells them how many other
pages there are, it tells them


533
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:33,746
where they are relative
to those pages.


534
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:36,256
It tells them that they
can swipe side to side


535
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,676
to navigate between pages.


536
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:38,946
It's a lot.


537
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:40,306
It's doing a lot; right?


538
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,986
It tells people a lot about
how to interact with the app.


539
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,336
But if you used a
menu for navigation,


540
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,866
there would be no onscreen
visual cues about how


541
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:53,236
to navigate, and like I said,
you wouldn't see any cues


542
00:25:53,236 --> 00:25:54,846
that navigation is
even possible.


543
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:57,776
So you might feel like the
screen you are currently looking


544
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:01,896
at is the only screen
the app has.


545
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:05,006
So it's best to stick with
just straight-up hierarchy


546
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:07,966
or page-based structures
in your app and not try


547
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,416
to use a menu for navigation.


548
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,446
Now, this is a bit of a tangent,
but it's related to menus,


549
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:15,836
so I thought I would
mention it here.


550
00:26:15,836 --> 00:26:17,686
It's sort of a bonus pitfall.


551
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:20,386
You don't have to
pay anything extra


552
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:23,726
for this, but I accept tips.


553
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:26,606
So in menus, like I said.


554
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:31,186
Menus are -- have a very
distinct visual style to them.


555
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,556
The appearance of the buttons
here have dark liner icons.


556
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:40,376
They are situated on these
filled-in lightish gray circles,


557
00:26:40,656 --> 00:26:41,716
and they have light labels.


558
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:44,026
It's a very distinct
visual appearance.


559
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:47,976
If you design your app's
UI to look like this,


560
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:50,546
it's going to confuse
the heck out of people.


561
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:53,766
They might think that they
pressed the display too hard


562
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:55,966
and they are actually looking
at the menu for your app,


563
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,486
and then they realize they
don't want to navigate anywhere


564
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:01,046
or do any of this
stuff, so they try


565
00:27:01,046 --> 00:27:02,796
to close this by
tapping outside.


566
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:05,266
But that does nothing, of
course, because they are not


567
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:08,436
in the menu, so they feel like
your app is frozen on them.


568
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:12,316
Not a good experience
for people to have.


569
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:13,856
Fundamentally, there's
nothing wrong


570
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:17,866
with having a navigation
system in your app


571
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:20,536
that has these large
graphical icons like this,


572
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:23,426
but try to do something
to distinguish it


573
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:26,136
from the appearance of
the menu control itself.


574
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:29,596
So rather than having those dark
icons, light gray background,


575
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:32,136
try adding in your
Global Tint color.


576
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:35,486
Or rather than having
the dark icons there,


577
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:39,076
maybe make them white and do an
outline stroke for the buttons.


578
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:41,646
Or do something more
even different than that.


579
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:44,816
Whatever you do, try to make
it distinct from the appearance


580
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:48,126
of the menu control itself.


581
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:52,506
Okay. So that's it for
menus, and that's it for me.


582
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,426
I actually would love to hand it
over to my esteemed colleague,


583
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,176
Rachel Roth, to take this home.


584
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:57,976
Rachel?


585
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:00,361
[Applause]


586
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:01,416
>> RACHEL ROTH: Thanks, Mike.


587
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,346
Hi, everybody.


588
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:07,596
My name is Rachel Roth, and I
am the other User Experience


589
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:08,776
Evangelist at Apple.


590
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:11,436
So I am going to take you
through the rest of this list.


591
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:15,216
On the Apple Watch,
it is really important


592
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:17,866
that people can quickly
determine what's tappable


593
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,326
and what's not tappable,
and a common problem


594
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,226
that we see all the
time are buttons


595
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:24,636
that don't look like buttons.


596
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:28,216
The Watch has its
own design language,


597
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:30,376
and it's not identical to iOS.


598
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:36,976
On iOS, we primarily rely on
color or position on the screen


599
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:38,536
to tell if something's tappable.


600
00:28:39,946 --> 00:28:44,296
So when a control is placed into
a toolbar or a navigation bar


601
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:46,816
and it's given a different
color, people can assume


602
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:49,126
that it's something that
they can interact with.


603
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:52,206
Like here on Maps, we
know that each item


604
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:53,426
in the corner is tappable


605
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,636
because of its location
and its color.


606
00:28:55,636 --> 00:29:01,266
Now, on Apple Watch, most
controls are put inside


607
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:04,466
of these rounded rectangle
or circular shapes,


608
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,726
and that's because of
the limited space we are


609
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:08,086
dealing with.


610
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:12,206
There just aren't room
to have a dedicated place


611
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,796
like a navigation
bar or toolbar.


612
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:19,016
Everything aside from the
status bar is in one view.


613
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:22,126
So there's no dedicated
place to put those controls.


614
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:27,196
And it's also trickier to rely
on color as a visual indication


615
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:30,856
of interactivity because
page titles are colored


616
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:31,716
on the Apple Watch.


617
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:36,056
And we do this to reinforce
context and also branding.


618
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,226
It aids in usability
because the color


619
00:29:39,226 --> 00:29:42,176
of the titles can help you
understand what app you are in,


620
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,206
especially if you
look away because --


621
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:47,496
to see if your bus is coming
and quickly look back.


622
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:50,806
Here are two apps with
very similar content.


623
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:55,766
We have Yelp on the left, and
on the right is Foursquare.


624
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:58,586
Again, both have
similar content,


625
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:01,616
but because Yelp has
their red branded color


626
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,126
and Foursquare is
more of a pink,


627
00:30:03,606 --> 00:30:09,446
that page title color lets
you know what app you're in.


628
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:10,096
Same thing.


629
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:15,486
We have Timers on the left and
Runtastic Six Pack on the right.


630
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,486
The color really helps reinforce
the identity of the application.


631
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:22,756
A lot of people have said
they are not sure how to set


632
00:30:22,756 --> 00:30:28,896
that color, so that's
the Global Tint color.


633
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:32,496
Now, another convention that we
use on iOS is we add chevrons


634
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:35,856
to things that are tappable,
like we do in table rows


635
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:40,076
of settings and next
to text labels


636
00:30:40,076 --> 00:30:44,586
like the developer
name in the App Store.


637
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:47,916
But if we put chevrons
on the Apple Watch, well,


638
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:50,236
they just take up
too much space.


639
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:54,186
If the label for
voicemail was any longer


640
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,456
or my font size was set larger,


641
00:30:56,816 --> 00:30:59,066
it would cause the text
to wrap or truncate.


642
00:31:00,586 --> 00:31:02,526
And also, they just
become noisy.


643
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:04,856
You are dealing with
a very compact width


644
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,646
on the Apple Watch, so the
chevrons become a distraction


645
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:09,786
from the icons and the text,


646
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,846
and that's the important
information.


647
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:15,516
If you are using the
rounded rectangle shapes,


648
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,936
there's no need to add chevrons
to indicate interactivity.


649
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:22,846
They are going to
instinctively look tappable.


650
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:25,436
Now, another convention that
we use on Apple Watch is


651
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:28,776
to put buttons into a circle,
and without the circle,


652
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:32,616
these phone icons would
look pretty ridiculous,


653
00:31:32,776 --> 00:31:36,656
and they would also seem maybe
more like a status indicator


654
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:38,166
or a decorative embellishment.


655
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:42,486
But the circle makes them
unmistakably button-y.


656
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:45,546
When you are dealing with
these short interaction times


657
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:48,036
and quick decisions,
you really want to --


658
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:50,206
people need to be able to
quickly react to something.


659
00:31:50,206 --> 00:31:51,656
I have a phone call.


660
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,416
Do I want to accept
or decline it?


661
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:56,606
The circles help make
the actions very clear.


662
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,186
But it's not as though
rounded rectangles


663
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:02,986
and circular shapes are these
revolutionary new concepts.


664
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,376
This is where there
is similarity to iOS.


665
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:08,446
We use circles on the iPhone


666
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:10,406
when buttons might
otherwise be ambiguous.


667
00:32:12,246 --> 00:32:13,986
Same with the rounded
rectangles.


668
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:16,506
You see them all the time
with segmented controls


669
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:18,906
and the Buy buttons
in the App Store.


670
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:22,526
In fact, if we didn't have
the rounded rectangle,


671
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:24,476
that Buy button might
be ambiguous,


672
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,076
and if there's one thing
we can all agree on,


673
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:29,656
we want to make it
really obvious how


674
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:32,326
to buy apps in the App Store.


675
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:35,606
So on Apple Watch,
the rounded rectangles


676
00:32:35,606 --> 00:32:39,276
and circles help people quickly
understand what's actionable,


677
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:40,656
and when you are dealing


678
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:42,856
with those really brief
interaction times,


679
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:45,936
like Mike said, you really just
have a couple seconds while


680
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:48,266
someone holds their arm
up before it gets tired.


681
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:50,886
Every fraction of
a second counts.


682
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,906
So you want to be sure to
put anything that's tappable


683
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:57,616
into a rounded rectangle
or circular shape,


684
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:01,206
and just as importantly,
don't use these shapes


685
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:02,846
for anything that's
not tappable.


686
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:06,756
They will look tappable and
confuse people if they aren't.


687
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:11,906
Now, in iOS, we sometimes do
use these shaded backgrounds


688
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:13,826
to group like items together.


689
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:17,466
So it might be tempting
to do something like this


690
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,846
on the Apple Watch,
but if you do,


691
00:33:20,116 --> 00:33:22,026
all of these things
would look tappable.


692
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:25,886
And if the person using your
app thinks they're tappable


693
00:33:25,886 --> 00:33:29,626
and they try tapping and nothing
happens, they're going to assume


694
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,926
that your app is broken.


695
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:33,586
So if you have a
situation like this,


696
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,896
you are much better off
using separator lines


697
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:38,796
to group things together,
just like we do in Stocks.


698
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:41,466
They demonstrate which
items are related,


699
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:43,286
and they'll also
help your eye track


700
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,586
across that horizontal list.


701
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:49,066
So make sure your
buttons look like buttons,


702
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:55,086
and make sure your
noninteractive content doesn't.


703
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,106
Which brings me to
the next item,


704
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:58,966
which is inadequate tap targets.


705
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:02,546
Now, knowing what is
interactive is a start,


706
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:04,916
but if people can't
easily tap those things,


707
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,126
you still have a
usability problem.


708
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:10,516
Designing for Touch is
critically important


709
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,456
on the Apple Watch, especially


710
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:14,985
since someone might be using
your app while they are


711
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:16,696
in motion.


712
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,985
So something like this might
seem usable when you are


713
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:21,896
in Photoshop or in Sketch.


714
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:25,476
You are sitting nice and
stable in your office chair,


715
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:27,606
you've got a nice big
monitor at your desk.


716
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:30,676
And even in the simulator


717
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:34,646
when you are using your
mouse, this seems very easy.


718
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:36,176
But once you get
it on the Watch,


719
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:39,426
it's going to be a problem
to hit those tap targets


720
00:34:39,426 --> 00:34:41,806
if they aren't adequately sized.


721
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:45,106
Scrolling is so easy
on the Watch.


722
00:34:45,136 --> 00:34:46,116
You've got the Crown.


723
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:47,856
It's easy to swipe your finger.


724
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:50,545
So don't be afraid to let
things scroll out of view,


725
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:53,916
especially if that means
you can avoid truncation


726
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:58,386
and make your buttons
really easy to hit.


727
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:01,326
Now, on the Apple Watch, you
want your circular controls


728
00:35:01,326 --> 00:35:07,326
to be at least 80 by 80 pixels
on the 42 millimeter or 75


729
00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:09,546
by 75 on the 38 millimeter.


730
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,236
But there's nothing
wrong with going bigger.


731
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:14,446
That's what Chipotle did.


732
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:18,776
The primary action, the one
thing they want people to do


733
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:20,896
with their Watch app
is order a burrito,


734
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:24,526
so they've got this nice, big
button that does exactly that.


735
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:26,846
I mean, there's no
way you are going


736
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:30,746
to have trouble tapping
that button.


737
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:33,046
Now, when it comes to
the rectangular buttons,


738
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:38,066
you absolutely should not go
smaller than 53 pixels in height


739
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:42,356
on the 42 millimeter
or 50 pixels on the 38.


740
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:44,686
But we tend to go larger
everywhere throughout


741
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,146
the system.


742
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,456
Usually 80 pixels
in height or more.


743
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:52,026
Again, bigger is better.


744
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,376
And always be sure to extend
your buttons to that full width


745
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:57,946
of the canvas, even if
you have a short label,


746
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:01,516
because this is not going to
be as easy to tap as this is,


747
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:03,376
especially when you
are about to step


748
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:04,876
out the door to go for a walk.


749
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,936
Now, in some cases, you may
need to have two buttons side


750
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:14,786
by side, and this will still
work, but you are going to have


751
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,756
to find really short
text labels.


752
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:22,286
And three side by side with text
is really not a good option,


753
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:24,436
even with the shortest words.


754
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:29,536
Now, if you have individual
numbers or single characters


755
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:33,566
or icons, you can get away with
putting three side by side,


756
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,056
but they're still going to
be really close together,


757
00:36:37,466 --> 00:36:39,236
especially on the
smaller-size watch,


758
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:42,726
and this often gives people
trouble tapping accurately.


759
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:46,006
Definitely don't
go more than three.


760
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:48,896
It's highly unlikely that
more than three buttons side


761
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:50,476
by side is going to be usable,


762
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,046
and that will just
frustrate people.


763
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:56,066
So be generous with
your tap targets


764
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,966
because this is the one time
you want to make it easy


765
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,896
for someone to push
your buttons.


766
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:02,776
It's Friday afternoon.


767
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:03,986
We are going for bad puns.


768
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:08,496
[Laughter] Next I'd like to
talk a little about legibility


769
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,846
because it is so
hard to use an app


770
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:13,526
if you can't actually read the
content it's displaying to you,


771
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:17,826
and when you are looking at
fonts in Photoshop or Sketch


772
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:21,106
or even the simulator, it's
easy to get a false sense


773
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,186
of how legible they are.


774
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:24,476
Again, you are sitting
at your desk,


775
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,686
you've got that nice big
display, you are probably


776
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:30,036
in some bright office lighting.


777
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:32,816
Something like this
might look totally fine.


778
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:34,916
But then once you
get it on the Watch,


779
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,176
it's going to look
more like this.


780
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:39,466
That's not legible.


781
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:42,886
Not at a glance,
at arm's distance


782
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,576
when you are moving on a train.


783
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:48,736
Larger type is going
to be easier to read.


784
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:51,876
And you don't just want to
look at this in Photoshop


785
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,226
or Sketch or the simulator.


786
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:59,506
You really need to look at your
apps in context on your wrist.


787
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:02,906
You need to make sure the most
important content is legible


788
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,566
when the person's
going to be needing it.


789
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:08,136
Can you tell the important
information as you are rushing


790
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,176
out the door to catch a bus?


791
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:12,356
Or while you are
actively doing crunches?


792
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:17,526
How about if you are outside on
a sunny day actively running?


793
00:38:18,516 --> 00:38:20,176
People need to quickly
be able to glance


794
00:38:20,176 --> 00:38:22,166
and see the information
that they are looking for.


795
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:26,936
Now, to optimize legibility,
I strongly encourage you


796
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:30,556
to use SF Compact, the
system font for Apple Watch.


797
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,606
Custom fonts are
able to be used,


798
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:37,866
but even at reasonable sizes,
thinner fonts just aren't going


799
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,506
to be as legible as
San Francisco is.


800
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:43,966
And San Francisco was
specifically designed


801
00:38:44,036 --> 00:38:45,586
to be the most legible font


802
00:38:45,586 --> 00:38:47,296
for digital display
that we can make.


803
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:51,346
And I could go on and on
about all the care and detail


804
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:54,496
that went into crafting this
typeface, but it's better


805
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:56,436
if you hear it from
the type team directly,


806
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:58,186
and if you didn't
see the session


807
00:38:58,356 --> 00:38:59,746
that was right before this one,


808
00:39:00,186 --> 00:39:02,686
I highly recommend
checking out the video.


809
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:05,406
It's really fantastic insight
into everything that went


810
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:06,716
into that typeface creation.


811
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:11,136
Now, the best way to
use the system font is


812
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:13,026
to use the system type styles


813
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:17,086
so that you can take
advantage of Dynamic Type.


814
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:20,406
Dynamic Type scales when
people adjust their preferred


815
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:21,326
reading size.


816
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:27,226
Now, if someone changes
their preferred reading size


817
00:39:27,226 --> 00:39:29,886
and your app doesn't adjust
to match that preference,


818
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:32,856
they are either going to
be disappointed, or worse,


819
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:35,306
they may not be able
to use your app at all.


820
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:38,816
Implementing Dynamic
Type is straightforward.


821
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:40,126
You just need to use one


822
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:42,396
of the five text styles
that we have here.


823
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:47,886
And then for each text
setting that someone specifies,


824
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,676
the system will adjust
a number of properties


825
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:54,296
to ensure optimal legibility
and typographic integrity.


826
00:39:55,296 --> 00:40:00,816
We adjust the size.


827
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:02,836
We also adjust the leading.


828
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:06,076
So that's the vertical space
between the lines of text.


829
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:08,526
And we adjust the tracking,


830
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:11,686
which is the space
between the letters.


831
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:17,656
And if you are using a
custom font, you will have


832
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:20,416
to handle all of these
sizing adjustments manually.


833
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:27,906
Now, like I said, we do have
five styles, Headline, Body,


834
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:30,046
Caption 1, Caption
2, and Footnote.


835
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:33,496
It's called Footnote
for a reason.


836
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:37,046
Don't be tempted to use
that for every piece of text


837
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:40,186
in your app just because
it's the small one.


838
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:44,746
Bigger is better when
it comes to everything


839
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:46,976
on the Watch, especially fonts.


840
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:51,936
Now, as Mike was saying
earlier, we really strive


841
00:40:52,036 --> 00:40:54,556
to blur the lines between
the hardware and the software


842
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:58,736
when it comes to Apple Watch,
and nothing wrecks that faster


843
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:01,566
than gratuitously
bright background colors


844
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:03,296
and unnecessary padding.


845
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:07,326
Suddenly the screen feels tiny,


846
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:09,306
and everything is
cramped into the center.


847
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:12,676
You are already dealing
with a small screen.


848
00:41:12,676 --> 00:41:16,016
You need to use every precious
pixel of that for your content.


849
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:19,686
Don't waste it on padding.


850
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:23,036
And bright backgrounds are
the worst because the majority


851
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:25,376
of the platform is on black, so
you are going to get this blast


852
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,736
of color, and you can't
change the background color


853
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:32,366
of the status bar, so it's
always going to be black,


854
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:34,626
which means that your
content area is going


855
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,906
to look even smaller.


856
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:40,446
And I also see a lot of
people putting photos


857
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:43,046
in the background just to
kind of jazz up their app,


858
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:47,846
and while this can be done
well, more often than not,


859
00:41:48,146 --> 00:41:49,976
it's a distraction
from the content.


860
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:53,776
It increases your file size
because you need more images,


861
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:57,416
which affects your launch times,
like Mike was talking about,


862
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:00,376
and it makes the
text harder to read.


863
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,196
Again, you are dealing


864
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:04,836
with these incredibly
short interaction times,


865
00:42:05,266 --> 00:42:06,986
so you want to eliminate
any friction


866
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:08,466
to interaction that you can.


867
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,776
Fractions of seconds have
never been so valuable


868
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:14,836
as they are on the Watch.


869
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:18,486
And while this lack of padding
is very uncomfortable to look


870
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:22,886
at in Photoshop, it does make
me cringe, everything is going


871
00:42:22,886 --> 00:42:24,486
to be great when you
get it to the Watch


872
00:42:24,556 --> 00:42:26,046
because of that hardware bezel.


873
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:28,626
The bezel is the
illusion of padding.


874
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:31,396
So this means you don't
need to add any in.


875
00:42:31,576 --> 00:42:34,876
You can use all of the screen
real estate for content


876
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:37,916
and controls, and you
will have less truncation


877
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:40,796
and text wrapping that way.


878
00:42:40,796 --> 00:42:42,406
And like I mentioned
a few minutes ago,


879
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:45,286
buttons that go edge to edge are
going to be much easier to tap.


880
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:48,506
If your app has a
black background,


881
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:51,366
it's going to blend seamlessly
into that bezel and feel


882
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:52,596
at home on the hardware.


883
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:56,556
It will be so much
easier for people to focus


884
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,076
on your content of your app.


885
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,956
But this doesn't mean you
have to make your app boring.


886
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:05,306
There are so many ways
to carry over branding


887
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:08,736
and add personality without
relying on a colored background.


888
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:11,936
I've got a few great
examples for you.


889
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:16,076
Hailo is one, a popular
taxi app in the UK.


890
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:18,746
They have this recognizable
bright yellow color


891
00:43:18,956 --> 00:43:22,126
and cheery car icon you see
throughout all of their app.


892
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:28,076
Citymapper relies on their green
color for branding recognition.


893
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:31,526
They have the Citymapper
face that they use


894
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,066
as loading graphics,
but most importantly,


895
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:36,476
they carry over their
cheeky sense of humor


896
00:43:36,476 --> 00:43:37,366
that they are known for.


897
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:40,816
Next time you guys need
directions someplace,


898
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:43,456
I highly recommend checking
out the teleport option.


899
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:47,846
Rules! is a really
fun memory game,


900
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,646
and they took the
background texture


901
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:53,766
that they use throughout their
iPhone app, and they've turned


902
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:56,406
that into the button
texture here on Apple Watch,


903
00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:00,426
and they also have these
really adorable characters


904
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:03,156
and charming animations,
so there's no way


905
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:04,706
that you could call
this app boring


906
00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:07,126
or confuse it with
some other app.


907
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:16,136
So there's no need to do
anything like this when you have


908
00:44:16,206 --> 00:44:18,596
so many better options
available to you.


909
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,436
So avoid those bright
backgrounds for embellishment,


910
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,316
and never inset your content.


911
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:27,586
Let the hardware bezel
take care of that for you.


912
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:34,556
But really, none of
these things matter


913
00:44:34,556 --> 00:44:38,996
if people can't find your
app in the first place.


914
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:43,346
Now, unlike iOS, Apple
Watch icons aren't labeled.


915
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:45,526
So it's especially important


916
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:48,096
that people can find your
app just from the icon.


917
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:51,016
And as you've undoubtedly
noticed,


918
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:55,126
the Watch App icons are
circular and much, much smaller.


919
00:44:55,856 --> 00:45:00,476
So that can present some
design challenges as well.


920
00:45:00,676 --> 00:45:05,036
Now, most of these Watch App
icons would be familiar to you


921
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,056
if you have their iPhone
apps on your phone.


922
00:45:09,116 --> 00:45:12,066
Making an exact match
of your Apple Watch icon


923
00:45:12,316 --> 00:45:14,476
to your iOS icon is the best way


924
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:19,336
to help people find
it on the Watch.


925
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:22,586
Citymapper and Nike+ Running


926
00:45:22,706 --> 00:45:26,496
and Procreate all directly
translated their App Icons


927
00:45:26,496 --> 00:45:28,656
for the Apple Watch, and that's


928
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:30,456
because they already
had very simple shapes


929
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:32,416
that would read well in
that circular format.


930
00:45:33,526 --> 00:45:35,716
But I know it's not
always that easy,


931
00:45:36,296 --> 00:45:38,936
so I have some techniques
you can try if you need


932
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:42,526
to make modifications to get
your App icon to read well


933
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:45,186
in a small circle and
still be recognizable.


934
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:48,216
The first thing to do, really,


935
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:50,866
is just simplify as
much as possible.


936
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:54,416
So what can be removed
and still be recognizable


937
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,386
as your brand in your app?


938
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:58,046
Start with text.


939
00:45:58,546 --> 00:46:02,466
Text is going to be particularly
tough at such small sizes.


940
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,796
So can you eliminate
it altogether?


941
00:46:05,956 --> 00:46:07,076
That's what Yelp did.


942
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:10,996
Their burst icon and their
signature red color is enough


943
00:46:10,996 --> 00:46:15,616
to make the app recognizable.


944
00:46:15,616 --> 00:46:18,816
So start by removing the text,
or if you absolutely can't,


945
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:20,096
look for an abbreviation.


946
00:46:20,096 --> 00:46:24,566
And if you have a lot
of detail in your icon,


947
00:46:24,566 --> 00:46:28,666
consider simplifying it because
that will help it be much easier


948
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,186
to read at those small sizes.


949
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:35,136
Take the Twitterific bird,
which many of us recognize.


950
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:39,606
Just scaling it down and masking
it into a circle wasn't going


951
00:46:39,606 --> 00:46:41,266
to work very well
on the Apple Watch.


952
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:45,656
The white space becomes awkward,
and the bird is just not


953
00:46:45,656 --> 00:46:46,826
as recognizable this way.


954
00:46:46,826 --> 00:46:51,716
So the Iconfactory team
redrew the bird to work better


955
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:53,206
in the small circular format.


956
00:46:53,966 --> 00:46:55,926
Now he is facing you dead on,


957
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,176
and a lot of the features have
been simplified or removed.


958
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:03,016
It's no longer got nostrils
on the beak, and the pupils


959
00:47:03,016 --> 00:47:07,126
and the eyebrows are much
simpler graphically rendered.


960
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:11,876
Complex shapes with a lot of
detail will be harder it see


961
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:17,186
at small sizes, so do
everything you can to simplify.


962
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:20,876
Now, unless you have a strong
justification for moving away


963
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:22,276
from your current color palette,


964
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:24,816
you want to retain your
current color scheme


965
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:26,006
and overall visual style.


966
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:29,826
Color is a very strong
branding element,


967
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:32,016
and that will be very important


968
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:35,946
in helping people
find your App icon.


969
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:39,336
What if messages were
suddenly a different color?


970
00:47:40,896 --> 00:47:43,746
You would probably think this
is a different app altogether,


971
00:47:44,246 --> 00:47:46,436
or a beta version,
or a trial version.


972
00:47:48,026 --> 00:47:51,786
So here you can see how
Fanatee simplified the App icon


973
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,186
for their game, Letter Zap.


974
00:47:54,716 --> 00:47:57,326
They removed the text, which
would have been impossible


975
00:47:57,326 --> 00:47:59,256
to read at the small
size on the Watch,


976
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:03,126
and enlarged the lightning
bolt, but most importantly,


977
00:48:03,126 --> 00:48:05,266
they retained that green
and gold color scheme,


978
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,386
which is what makes
it so recognizable.


979
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:13,726
So even though it might seem
scary to remove text or change


980
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:16,146
that icon that you have
been using for so long,


981
00:48:16,456 --> 00:48:20,056
as long as you retain the
overall color and visual style


982
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:23,156
of your App icon, it's still
going to be recognizable.


983
00:48:25,156 --> 00:48:28,526
Now, as Mike said
earlier, it is not a goal


984
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:31,816
to offer all the
functionality of your iPhone app


985
00:48:31,816 --> 00:48:36,446
onto the Watch, so sometimes
using an identical App icon may


986
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,536
not be appropriate.


987
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,656
Your Watch app might offer
complementary functions


988
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:46,066
to your iPhone, so maybe a
complementary Watch App icon


989
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,346
concept might be better.


990
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:52,536
As we were talking about
earlier, the Camera app


991
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:55,166
on the iPhone offers a
ton of functionality.


992
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,246
You can take pictures,
edit them, share them.


993
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,706
But on the Watch, it
really just acts as a remote


994
00:49:00,706 --> 00:49:01,676
for the shutter button.


995
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:06,086
So we could have taken this App
icon and just put it in a circle


996
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:10,006
and called it done, but
it didn't feel right.


997
00:49:10,226 --> 00:49:12,976
Instead, we came up with
a complementary concept.


998
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:18,036
It's still a recognizable Camera
icon, but we've simplified some


999
00:49:18,036 --> 00:49:20,846
of the texture, retained
the color scheme,


1000
00:49:21,196 --> 00:49:23,326
and really emphasized
the shutter button


1001
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:25,186
because that's what
this app does for you.


1002
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:28,816
It presses the shutter button.


1003
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:31,916
Another great example
of this is Sky Guide.


1004
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:35,216
Now, masking their icon


1005
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:37,526
into a circle just
doesn't read very well.


1006
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:42,376
The composition is off, and
it doesn't exactly feel right


1007
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:43,866
because of what the
app does for you.


1008
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:46,966
On the iPhone, Sky Guide is all


1009
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:49,246
about telling you,
What am I looking at?


1010
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,466
What am I seeing
right now in the sky?


1011
00:49:52,346 --> 00:49:54,946
But on the Watch, it's
alerting you when there's


1012
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:57,016
about to be an event
in your area,


1013
00:49:57,496 --> 00:49:59,546
like the International
Space Station might be


1014
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:01,246
about to fly overhead.


1015
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:05,176
So they came up with a
complementary concept


1016
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:08,946
for their App icon, and
it looks great in a circle


1017
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:11,746
and implies an astronomical
event.


1018
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:15,446
But because they're using
similar color scheme


1019
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:18,296
and visual style, the
relationship is very clear.


1020
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:23,126
So if you are struggling
how to adapt your iOS icon


1021
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:25,316
for Apple Watch, try
some of these approaches.


1022
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:29,876
Because none of these Apple
Watch icons are literally the


1023
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:34,046
same as their iOS counterparts,
but the resemblance is clear,


1024
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:36,656
and as a result, the
apps are easy to find.


1025
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:42,586
And as I've said many times, it
is not necessary for your Watch


1026
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:46,906
and iOS icons to be identical
twins, but you do want them


1027
00:50:46,906 --> 00:50:48,036
to look like siblings.


1028
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:54,606
So that takes us to the end of
our list, and as you're working


1029
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:58,656
on your Watch apps, I hope this
will be a handy tool for you


1030
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:01,956
so you can avoid some of those
common usability pitfalls.


1031
00:51:02,746 --> 00:51:04,576
It really has been
amazing for us


1032
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:07,976
to see how many great Watch
apps are out there already,


1033
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:10,526
and we're so excited to
see what you guys come


1034
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,006
up with for watchOS 2.


1035
00:51:13,556 --> 00:51:16,376
We had a ton of great
design sessions this week,


1036
00:51:16,496 --> 00:51:18,306
and the WatchKit Tips
and Tricks, again,


1037
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,906
from this morning was
particularly fantastic.


1038
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,956
And loads of information online,


1039
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:26,216
especially the Designing
Great Apps page.


1040
00:51:26,976 --> 00:51:29,856
It has been a tremendous week.


1041
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:32,936
I hope you guys have had
as much fun as we have.


1042
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:35,556
There's still a few
more hours of labs left,


1043
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:37,426
so go take full advantage
of that,


1044
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:39,286
and we'll see you next year.


1045
00:51:39,286 --> 00:51:39,786
Thank you.


1046
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:43,500
[Applause]
