 Abstract: Controller for the main table view of this sample sample.
 This table view controller works off the AppDelege's data model.
 produce a three-stage lazy load:
 1. No data (i.e. an empty table)
 2. Text-only data from the model's RSS feed
 3. Images loaded over the network asynchronously
 
 This process allows for asynchronous loading of the table to keep the UI responsive.
 Stage 3 is managed by the AppRecord corresponding to each row/cell.
 
 Images are scaled to the desired height.
 If rapid scrolling is in progress, downloads do not begin until scrolling has ended.
