/*
    Theory of Operation
    -------------------
    Some critical points:
    
     1. By the time we're running on the run loop thread, we know that all further state 
        transitions happen on the run loop thread.  That's because there are only three 
        states (inited, executing, and finished) and run loop thread code can only run 
        in the last two states and the transition from executing to finished is 
        always done on the run loop thread.

     2. -start can only be called once.  So run loop thread code doesn't have to worry 
        about racing with -start because, by the time the run loop thread code runs, 
        -start has already been called.
        
     3. Likewise, because -start can only be called once, it doesn't have to worry about 
        racing with invocations of -start.
        
     3. -cancel can be called multiple times from any thread.  Run loop thread code 
        must take a lot of care with do the right thing with cancellation.  Also, -cancel 
        and -start can race.
    
    Some state sequences:
    
     1. no execute (testNoExecute)
    
        [-init]
        [-dealloc]

        This is the case where you create the operation and never run it.  That's just fine by us.
        
        There are no formal sequence points here because neither -init nor -dealloc have logging (-init 
        because you can't tell whether logging is enabled at that time, and -dealloc because, once the 
        object is called, there's no way to collect the log).

     2. no execute, cancel (testNoExecute)
     
        [-init]
        >cancel
        -cancel.winner
        <cancel
        [-dealloc]

        This is the case where you create the operation, cancel it, but never run it.  We specifically 
        want to allow this to make it easier to write clean up code.

     3. cancel before start (testCancelBeforeStart)
     
        [-init]
        >cancel
        -cancel.winner
        <cancel
        >start
        -setState.executing
        <start
        >startOnRunLoopThread
        -startOnRunLoopThread.cancelled
        >finishWithError
        -finishWithError.error
        -setState.finished
        <finishWithError
        <startOnRunLoopThread
        [-dealloc]
        
        I originally thought that this could never happen, but it seems that NSOperationQueue will 
        quite happily start a cancelled operation.
        
        Note that the following sequence /can't/ happen:
        
        [-init]
        >cancel
        -cancel.winner
        <cancel
        >start
        -setState.executing
        <start
        [-dealloc]

        because a) the operation queue holds a reference to the operation until it's finished, and 
        b) the -start uses -performSelector:onThread: to queue a call to -startOnRunLoopThread, 
        and that retains the object.

     4. cancel during start, before schedule (testCancelDuringStart)

        [-init]
        >start
        -setState.executing
        -start.cancelBefore
        >cancel
        -cancel.winner
        -cancel.schedule
        <cancel
        <start
        >cancelOnRunLoopThread
        -cancelOnRunLoopThread.cancel
        >finishWithError
        -finishWithError.error
        -setState.finished
        <finishWithError
        <cancelOnRunLoopThread
        >startOnRunLoopThread
        -startOnRunLoopThread.bounce
        <startOnRunLoopThread
        [-dealloc]
     
        This is what happens if -cancel gets called while -start is running but before -start 
        has scheduled -startOnRunLoopThread to execute.  -cancelOnRunLoopThread is queued 
        before -startOnRunLoopThread, so -startOnRunLoopThread runs second, notices the cancellation, 
        and then bounces.

     5. cancel during start, after schedule (testCancelDuringStart)

        [-init]
        >start
        -setState.executing
        -start.cancelAfter
        >cancel
        -cancel.winner
        -cancel.schedule
        <cancel
        <start
        >startOnRunLoopThread
        -startOnRunLoopThread.cancelled
        >finishWithError
        -finishWithError.error
        -setState.finished
        <finishWithError
        <startOnRunLoopThread
        >cancelOnRunLoopThread
        -cancelOnRunLoopThread.bounce
        <cancelOnRunLoopThread
        [-dealloc]
     
        This is what happens if -cancel gets called while -start is running but before -start 
        has scheduled -startOnRunLoopThread to execute.  -cancelOnRunLoopThread is queued 
        after -startOnRunLoopThread, so -startOnRunLoopThread runs first and does the real work 
        and -cancelOnRunLoopThread runs second and bounces.
        
     6. Basics (testBasics)

        [-init]
        >start
        -setState.executing
        <start
        >startOnRunLoopThread
        -startOnRunLoopThread.start
        <startOnRunLoopThread
        >finishWithError
        -finishWithError.noError
        -setState.finished
        <finishWithError
        [-dealloc]
        
        This is the standard run-to-completion case.

     7. Basics with cancel (testBasicsCancel)

        [-init]
        >start
        -setState.executing
        <start
        >startOnRunLoopThread
        -startOnRunLoopThread.start
        <startOnRunLoopThread
        >cancel
        -cancel.winner
        -cancel.schedule
        <cancel
        >cancelOnRunLoopThread
        -cancelOnRunLoopThread.cancel
        >finishWithError
        -finishWithError.error
        -setState.finished
        <finishWithError
        <cancelOnRunLoopThread
        [-dealloc]

        This is the standard cancel-while-executing case.  -cancelOnRunLoopThread wins the race 
        with finish, and it detects that the operation is executing and actually cancels. 

     8. Basics with late cancel (testBasicsCancelLate)
     
        [-init]
        >start,
        -setState.executing,
        <start,
        >startOnRunLoopThread,
        -startOnRunLoopThread.start,
        <startOnRunLoopThread,
        >finishWithError,
        -finishWithError.noError,
        -setState.finished,
        <finishWithError,
        >cancel,
        -cancel.winner,
        <cancel
        [-dealloc]
        
        The cancellation comes in after the operation has finished.  -cancelOnRunLoopThread is 
        not scheduled because the operation is already in the finished state.  Also note that 
        we call [super cancel] in this case, but that has no effect: -[NSOperation cancel] looks 
        at -isFinished and bounces in that case.

     9. Much delayed cancel (testDelayedCancel)

        [-init]
        >start
        -setState.executing
        <start
        >startOnRunLoopThread
        -startOnRunLoopThread.start
        <startOnRunLoopThread
        >cancel
        -cancel.winner
        -cancel.delay
        >finishWithError
        -finishWithError.noError
        -setState.finished
        <finishWithError
        -cancel.schedule
        <cancel
        >cancelOnRunLoopThread
        -cancelOnRunLoopThread.bounce
        <cancelOnRunLoopThread
        [-dealloc]
        
        This is very similar to case 5 but the thread doing the cancel has been artifically 
        delayed to ensure that the finish happens between the start of -cancel and its end.

    Markup:
        [x]  denotes an emplied sequence point.
        >x   denotes the entry to -[QRunLoopOperation x].
        <x   denotes the return of -[QRunLoopOperation x].
        -x.y denotes a significant point within -[QRunLoopOperation x].
        -x   denotes an otherwise unannotated invocation of -[QRunLoopOperation x].
        (x)  means that the case is tested by the unit test method -[UnitTests x].
