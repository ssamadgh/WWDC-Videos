NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/*! Implements AES encryption and decryption with PKCS#7 padding in a way that's suitable for large data sets.
 *  \details The key difference between this and `QCCAESPadCryptor` is that this operation 
 *      reads its input data from a stream and writes its output data to a stream, rather than 
 *      requiring the data to be in memory.
 *      
 *      In padded AES, the unencrypted data can be of any length wbile the length of the 
 *      encrypted data is always an even multiple of the AES block size (`kCCBlockSizeAES128`, 
 *      or 16).  Encrypted the data will always increase its length (slightly), while decrypting 
 *      it will do the reverse.
 *
 *      This operation supports both EBC and CBC mode.
 *      
 *  \warning In most cases you will want to use AES in CBC mode; to do that securely, set the 
 *      initialisation vector (via the `ivData` property) to some cryptographically sound 
 *      random data.  If you need to use EBC mode, which is generally not recommended, set 
 *      the `ivData` property to nil.
 *      
 *  \note The designated initialiser for this class is private.  In the unlikely event you 
 *      need to subclass it, you will have to make that public.
 *      
 *  \note The operation reads and writes the streams synchronously, making it only suitable for 
 *      use with file streams.  An operation that supported network streams would be significantly 
 *      more complex.
