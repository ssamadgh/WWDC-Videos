00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,076
>> Good afternoon, everyone, and


4
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:30,656
welcome to Integrating Apps and


5
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,016
Content with AR Quick Look.


6
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,176
My name is David Lui, and I'm so


7
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:35,446
excited to talk to you about AR


8
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:35,926
Quick Look.


9
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:37,936
As you all saw yesterday at the


10
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:39,976
Keynote, we brought this new


11
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,726
capability of previewing 3D


12
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:44,476
models in AR space throughout


13
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:45,606
iOS.


14
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:47,436
AR is becoming the tool to see


15
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:48,886
what objects look like in the


16
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:51,096
world, from a new sofa you're


17
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,376
purchasing for your living room


18
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:54,386
to that cute animated character


19
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:55,766
you're reading about in your


20
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:57,016
book.


21
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,546
AR Quick Look was designed to


22
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:01,676
enrich any application on the OS


23
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,836
with AR content with a simpler


24
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:06,266
way to adopt AR previewing for


25
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,986
consistent viewing experience.


26
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:11,426
So, in this session, we'll take


27
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:13,176
a deeper look at what AR Quick


28
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,516
Look is, how to design your app


29
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:17,286
and web page to take advantage


30
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,526
of AR Quick Look, and creating


31
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:22,686
content specifically for it.


32
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:23,706
So, let's get started.


33
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,566
So, let me show you what AR


34
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,116
Quick Look is with the files


35
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:28,366
app.


36
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:30,326
Let's preview the 3D silver


37
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:32,186
pitcher model and push it into


38
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:32,376
AR.


39
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,046
We find the table, and we place


40
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:36,296
the pitcher on the surface.


41
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:38,256
You can see the pitcher on a


42
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:40,146
1-to-1 scale and get a better


43
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,016
understanding of how it fits


44
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:42,726
with your surrounding.


45
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,166
On my table, I have an Apple


46
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,126
mug, some Post-its, and a


47
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,246
kettle, and it looks so


48
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,526
realistic with these items.


49
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:52,916
And what's really amazing is


50
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,106
that you can see the colorful


51
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,016
Post-its reflecting on the lower


52
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,306
body of the pitcher, giving this


53
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,876
illusion that it's actually


54
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:00,316
really there.


55
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:02,586
So, it's really magical how the


56
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:04,016
virtual pitcher blends in with


57
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:04,866
the physical world.


58
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:08,696
To help get my lovely pitcher in


59
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,476
the world, we're using AR Quick


60
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:11,086
Look.


61
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:14,116
The way to preview 3D content in


62
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:14,296
AR.


63
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:16,856
AR Quick Look is built in and


64
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:19,316
deeply integrated into the OS to


65
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:20,766
allow previewing from any


66
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,346
application and websites.


67
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,756
The deep integration comes from


68
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:27,456
us using, of course, Quick Look


69
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,396
technologies and expanding its


70
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:30,996
capabilities to enhance the


71
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:32,906
system experience with AR.


72
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:36,086
The AR portion of Quick Look is


73
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:38,366
available in iOS 12 on ARKit


74
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,716
compatible devices and only


75
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:42,776
object mode on non-ARKit


76
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:43,606
supported devices.


77
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:46,436
You'll see this new AR file icon


78
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,786
throughout the OS to represent


79
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,846
the new 3D file format usdz.


80
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:53,416
Let's invite you to Quick Look,


81
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:56,166
the 3D content in our viewer and


82
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,366
see how it looks like in your


83
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:57,586
world.


84
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,926
So, let's tap on the icon to


85
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:01,986
launch AR Quick Look.


86
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,426
AR Quick Look handles setting up


87
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,276
the AR experience like plane


88
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:07,666
detection, object placement,


89
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:10,326
gesture manipulations, and


90
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:11,776
creating contact shadows.


91
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,126
But these are only a subset of


92
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,926
all the viewer capabilities that


93
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,326
together with rendering a 3D


94
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:19,086
model, provides an immersive


95
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:19,766
experience.


96
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:23,396
So, use AR Quick Look if your


97
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:25,286
goal is to preview 3D objects


98
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:26,746
and push them into the world.


99
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:28,696
By adopting our new system


100
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:30,846
viewer, you got a consistent 3D


101
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:32,476
content previewing experience,


102
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,116
so you don't need to create your


103
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:35,003
own.


104
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:36,776
It's really easy to adopt and


105
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:38,196
integrate the viewer into a


106
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,676
website and application and it


107
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:40,986
could be as simple as embedding


108
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,236
a usdz file if your application


109
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,736
already supports and uses Quick


110
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:44,916
Look.


111
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:47,376
Just as you saw from the


112
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:48,996
previous slide, AR Quick Look


113
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,586
does all the heavy work for you


114
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:52,576
in providing and creating a


115
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:53,906
great AR experience.


116
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,196
And it's truly magical how you


117
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,826
get an amazing AR experience by


118
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,326
just providing the 3D content


119
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:02,036
and we make this super easy for


120
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:02,966
you so you don't have to deal


121
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,486
with any AR specifics.


122
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:07,386
So, how about we see AR Quick


123
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,546
Look in action with the web


124
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:08,826
demo.


125
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:16,196
[ Applause ]


126
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:18,206
So, here, I have the files up,


127
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,096
and I have a catalogue of 3D


128
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:20,606
objects.


129
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:22,656
You'll notice that there's these


130
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:24,286
rich and beautiful thumbnails


131
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:26,146
with the AR badge stamp at the


132
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,366
top right-hand corner, and


133
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:28,156
that's there to tell you that


134
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:29,376
there's an AR experience behind


135
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:29,666
this.


136
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:31,806
So, I have a lot of great models


137
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:33,356
to choose from, but my personal


138
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,926
favorite is this little purple


139
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:36,716
guy at the top right-hand


140
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:37,036
corner.


141
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,576
So, Radar is our bug tracking


142
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,366
software, and if you don't know,


143
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,156
the purple aardvark is our


144
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:43,556
mascot.


145
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,976
So, I'll go ahead and Quick Look


146
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:47,496
the purple aardvark into the


147
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,816
viewer where we can see her in


148
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,886
our studio-like environment,


149
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:54,006
which we call object mode.


150
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:56,426
So, you can really pan around


151
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,466
and see the model from various


152
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,176
different angles.


153
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,316
We can pinch to size an object


154
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,266
and make it look a lot larger


155
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:04,746
and really see the fine details


156
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:05,626
that went into this model.


157
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,506
So, you can see how there's


158
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,196
animation baked into this model,


159
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,186
and AR Quick Look supports


160
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,036
transform animation and skeletal


161
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,706
animation, so the purple


162
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:17,476
aardvark is really lively and


163
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:18,536
animated with personality.


164
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,596
And just like a photo, you can


165
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:22,846
double tap on the model to


166
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:24,206
recess the position and the


167
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:24,576
size.


168
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,346
But of course, the beauty really


169
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:29,056
comes from pushing my purple


170
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,246
aardvark into the world.


171
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,656
So, I'll tap on the AR tab, and


172
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,526
there, the purple aardvark is in


173
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:36,936
the world.


174
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:40,366
And so we were able to place the


175
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,836
model so quickly into the world


176
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,066
because we started the AR


177
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,966
session the moment AR Quick Look


178
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,726
was launched, and we gathered


179
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:48,846
all the feature points of the


180
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:50,386
environment and pushed the


181
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:51,416
objects quickly out into the


182
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:51,736
world.


183
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,116
So, right here, you can notice


184
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:56,676
that the controls are hidden for


185
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,066
a full immersive experience.


186
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,376
Controls like the status bar,


187
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:01,226
on-screen controls and iPhone X,


188
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:03,326
we hide the home indicator.


189
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,526
So, you can go ahead and rotate


190
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,246
the objects using your standard


191
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:09,516
iOS rotation gestures.


192
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:11,396
You can scale the object down


193
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,406
using your two-finger pinch and


194
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,516
scale it larger if you want it


195
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:15,346
to be a lot cuter.


196
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,246
And so, you can see that


197
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,976
animation there where the purple


198
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,856
aardvark is just fixing all my


199
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:23,076
bugs and just slurping them up.


200
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:24,156
So, I can go ahead and


201
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,356
double-tap to reset the size


202
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:27,776
back to 100%, and you can


203
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:30,256
translate the model by just


204
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,576
tapping on it and dragging it to


205
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:32,636
a different place on the table.


206
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:35,786
Or you can tap on it and move


207
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,616
the device around for device


208
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:39,346
movement, really seamless


209
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:39,966
interactions.


210
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:42,446
Of course, since this is an AR


211
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:43,646
experience, we really encourage


212
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:47,536
you to walk around and be really


213
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,946
engaged and immerse and see that


214
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:51,706
animation, see the model that's


215
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:52,686
pushed out into the world.


216
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,476
So, we've also provided a


217
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:58,346
contact shadow.


218
00:06:58,656 --> 00:06:59,846
So, you'll notice right there


219
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,656
just sitting on the edge, this


220
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,176
tells you that the purple


221
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:04,696
aardvark is grounded and placed


222
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:06,096
on that table in the world.


223
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,406
And what makes the aardvark look


224
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:10,096
so amazing right now is that


225
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,966
we're matching the color


226
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:12,206
intensity and the temperature


227
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,516
that's reported by ARKit from


228
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,036
the world, and we're using that


229
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:15,946
with our lighting setup.


230
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,426
So, I think this is really


231
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:19,886
amazing.


232
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:21,226
I want to remember this moment.


233
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:22,366
So, I'm going to go ahead and


234
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:23,646
tap to show the controls.


235
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,686
I'm going to take a snapshot of


236
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:25,976
this.


237
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:29,546
So, right here, I'm going to go


238
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:30,796
ahead and mark up the moment,


239
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,036
and this is really amazing, so I


240
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,126
can save this later and take a


241
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:38,616
look at this.


242
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,046
But with AR Quick Look, we


243
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:46,476
really wanted to make AR


244
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:48,506
accessible to everyone, and we


245
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:49,596
do mean everyone.


246
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,396
Accessibility is one of our core


247
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,536
values, and so we made AR Quick


248
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:55,166
Look work with VoiceOver and


249
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:55,646
switch control.


250
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:56,816
So, let me show you the


251
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:57,826
VoiceOver flow right now.


252
00:07:58,606 --> 00:07:59,406
So, I'll triple click the home


253
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:00,676
button to activate VoiceOver.


254
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:03,596
>> VoiceOver on.


255
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,156
Files. Close.


256
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:06,006
Button. Landscape.


257
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,616
>> So, I navigate over to the AR


258
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:07,936
tab.


259
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,276
>> Home button to the right.


260
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:11,696
AR button.


261
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,276
Selected AR.


262
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:17,046
Radar aardvark is now positioned


263
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:17,586
in the world.


264
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:19,756
>> And what's really cool is now


265
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,466
you get audible feedback for


266
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,796
when my Radar aardvark is off


267
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:24,066
screen.


268
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:26,936
>> Radar aardvark is now off


269
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:27,406
screen.


270
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,126
>> AR when is back on screen.


271
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,886
>> Radar aardvark is now on


272
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:31,376
screen.


273
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,216
>> And this is really amazing,


274
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:35,076
and we really encourage


275
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:38,106
developers and users to really


276
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,076
think about the full


277
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,826
accessibility workflow in your


278
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:42,696
applications and websites as you


279
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,275
adopt and integrate AR Quick


280
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:44,566
Look.


281
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:49,356
[ Applause ]


282
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,196
So, I just showed you AR Quick


283
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,286
Look integrated into the files


284
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,876
app, but that's one of six first


285
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:57,546
party apps to have adopted and


286
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:58,326
integrate the viewer.


287
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:02,806
The others are mail, messages,


288
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,796
notes, news, and Safari.


289
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,496
And the great news is with AR


290
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:11,066
Quick Look built into Safari


291
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,056
itself, developers can integrate


292
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,536
it into their websites by using


293
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:16,856
our notational [phonetic] markup


294
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,106
that I'll talk more about later.


295
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,916
Lastly, you can adopt a viewer


296
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:22,876
into your iOS application to


297
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,156
provide a more immersive


298
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,066
experience with AR.


299
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:29,646
So, sharing a 3D model between


300
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,436
all these apps requires the


301
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,846
models to be bundled up in a


302
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,146
single sharable file.


303
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:36,306
To enable this, AR Quick Look


304
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:39,006
supports usdz, which is a new


305
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:40,536
file format for mobile


306
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,196
distribution of 3D models.


307
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,046
usdz packages all these models


308
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,156
and textures into a single file


309
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,076
for efficient delivery of 3D


310
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,926
content without having to work


311
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:52,226
with reference files.


312
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,326
It's based on Pixar's


313
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,856
open-source universal scene


314
00:09:56,856 --> 00:09:58,916
description format, or short,


315
00:09:59,276 --> 00:09:59,666
USD.


316
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:03,576
And usdz is supported on iOS and


317
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:06,206
macOS, in SceneKit and Model


318
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,726
I/O, and later in the session,


319
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,316
we'll show you how to convert 3D


320
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:12,726
models into the usdz format


321
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,016
using the new usdz Converter


322
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:16,916
tool that ships as part of Xcode


323
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,006
10.


324
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,616
Now that you know more about AR


325
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,056
Quick Look, let's talk about how


326
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,506
to integrate the viewer itself.


327
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,206
You can integrate AR Quick Look


328
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:27,786
in two different mediums.


329
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,776
The first, in an application.


330
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,716
Apps that showcase a lot of


331
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,726
photos and text can provide


332
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,476
better imagery and a really


333
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:36,926
immersive experience with AR


334
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:37,756
Quick Look integrated.


335
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:39,896
And here, we're using Quick Look


336
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:41,516
API to facilitate this


337
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,416
integration, to preview usdz


338
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,066
files, and load them into the


339
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:45,366
viewer.


340
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,086
Second, is in websites in


341
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:48,546
Safari.


342
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:51,106
So, integrating AR Quick Look in


343
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,946
news articles and product pages


344
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,506
of online storefronts really


345
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:55,626
complements the reading and


346
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,496
shopping experience by providing


347
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:58,836
a new way to visualize the


348
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:00,576
content and develop a better


349
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,876
understanding of what you're


350
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,366
actually seeing, and we'll be


351
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:06,046
writing HTML to allow previewing


352
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,986
AR content on the web.


353
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:10,306
So, let's get started with


354
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:11,856
applications and how the Quick


355
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:14,036
Look API is used to provide an


356
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:14,906
AR experience.


357
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,126
So, if you're not already


358
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,026
familiar, let me quickly explain


359
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:19,456
Quick Look.


360
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:21,266
Quick Look is all about


361
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,836
previewing documents like


362
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:26,206
Keynotes, PDFs, images, and now


363
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:27,706
3D model files like usdz.


364
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,376
Quick Look itself is an iOS


365
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:31,786
framework that not only provides


366
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:33,756
support to preview documents,


367
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,126
but also will be really to


368
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,066
create and provide custom


369
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,386
previews for your custom file


370
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:38,846
types.


371
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:40,906
It comes with everything you


372
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:42,206
need to preview documents.


373
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:44,456
You can control the transition


374
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,376
and the different presentation


375
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:47,996
modes for Quick Look, like being


376
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:50,026
embedded inline or incorporating


377
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:51,786
a push navigation flow and the


378
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:53,016
standard modal presentation.


379
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:55,226
And what's really amazing is


380
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:56,856
that security is handled for you


381
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:58,606
where the contents of the usdz


382
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:01,156
file is safely read to present a


383
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:02,746
preview for you.


384
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,566
Now, there's a dedicated endup


385
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,696
session about Quick Look and


386
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:08,006
previewing all file types,


387
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:10,056
including the new usdz file type


388
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:10,916
that I encourage you to check


389
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:10,983
out.


390
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,426
So, let's take a quick look at


391
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:16,716
the preview flow.


392
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:18,006
Here's the apps ViewController


393
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:18,596
on the left.


394
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:20,816
It has a grid of thumbnails for


395
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,076
various 3D models.


396
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:23,376
When someone taps on one of


397
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,896
these thumbnails, I want to show


398
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:25,726
a Quick Look preview of the


399
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:26,886
model for that thumbnail.


400
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,246
The first thing I want to do is


401
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:31,126
create a QLPreviewController.


402
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:32,826
I have instance, I have


403
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,096
ViewController that allows you


404
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:35,046
to preview documents.


405
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,876
And I set myself as a dataSource


406
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:38,706
and a delegate.


407
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,586
So it can ask me questions about


408
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:41,476
what should be previewed.


409
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,876
With that configured, I present


410
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,256
that QLPreviewController.


411
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:47,836
Now, it doesn't appear


412
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:48,766
immediately, however.


413
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,636
It first asks me some questions.


414
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,186
It starts by asking how many


415
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,486
items do you have for me to


416
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:55,826
preview?


417
00:12:55,826 --> 00:12:57,736
And for usdz files, the answer


418
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,096
is one.


419
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,746
Now, it asks me for a URL for


420
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,376
the first item to be previewed,


421
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,846
and I respond with the file URL


422
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:08,316
for my app bundle for the model


423
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:10,046
that was tapped.


424
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,056
Finally, it asks me for the view


425
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,856
to use as a source view for the


426
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:15,356
transition animation for when


427
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:16,296
the preview is presented.


428
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:18,666
And here, I want a seamless


429
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,276
animation from the view that was


430
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:21,576
tapped to the view that was


431
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:22,376
going to be presented.


432
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,306
And so, I return View #3.


433
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,366
With all that configured, we're


434
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:28,606
ready to present our preview


435
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,496
controller, and so it's going to


436
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:31,776
animate and scale up from the


437
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:32,486
view that was tapped.


438
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:35,556
And this is what it looks like


439
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:35,856
in code.


440
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,026
In order to preview and present


441
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,466
documents, we need to


442
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:40,506
instantiate a


443
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,466
QLPreviewController.


444
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:42,856
It's part of the Quick Look


445
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:43,216
framework.


446
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,756
It has a dataSource and a


447
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,346
delegate, which I'll get into in


448
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:47,686
a bit.


449
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:50,016
And then we then present the


450
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,276
previewController modally.


451
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:53,086
Pretty simple, right.


452
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:54,976
So, let's take a look at the


453
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,476
protocol for a dataSource.


454
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,026
So, as I just mentioned, we need


455
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:00,976
to conform to the


456
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,126
QLPreviewControllerDataSource


457
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:03,606
protocol.


458
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,136
This protocol has two required


459
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,976
functions; one to provide data


460
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:08,986
to the Quick Look Preview


461
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:09,406
Controller.


462
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:11,896
The first being, the number of


463
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:13,296
preview items in controller.


464
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,116
And here, you return the number


465
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,086
of items that your Preview


466
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:18,046
Controller should preview.


467
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,406
For AR Quick Look, it only


468
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,966
allows previewing a single


469
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,706
object in one dedicated session,


470
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:25,446
and so we returned the one item.


471
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:27,696
The second function we're


472
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:28,906
implementing is


473
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,196
PreviewController


474
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:32,306
previewItemAtindex.


475
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,396
And here, you returned the one


476
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:35,826
item that we we're requesting to


477
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:36,376
be previewed.


478
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,486
This is the URL where to find a


479
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,176
3D object on disk.


480
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,686
Now, this should look very


481
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:45,646
familiar to a lot of you, and


482
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:46,716
this is because we're using a


483
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:48,276
very similar data source and


484
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:51,566
delicate pattern from UIKit like


485
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:52,766
Table Views.


486
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,166
So, moving to the protocol for


487
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,506
that delegate, there are a few


488
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:57,486
ways to present the preview.


489
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:59,276
AR Quick Look is intended to be


490
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:00,356
presented full screen.


491
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:02,506
To share the same consistent


492
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,166
experience with AR Quick Look, I


493
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,316
recommend you configure your


494
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:06,336
Quick Look PreviewController's


495
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,426
appearance to have the same zoom


496
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:09,346
transition animation.


497
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:11,576
So when the file's up, you can


498
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:12,646
see the nice transition from the


499
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:16,096
thumbnail view to the viewer and


500
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,576
back down as it goes down for


501
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:17,986
dismissal.


502
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:21,616
In code, the easiest and


503
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:22,796
recommended way to achieve this


504
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,196
effect is to implement


505
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:26,276
PreviewController, controller


506
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,546
transitionViewfor item and


507
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:29,476
return a UIView.


508
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:31,986
So, Quick Look does all of the


509
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:33,926
heavy work here for you and uses


510
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:35,466
the UIView to infer the


511
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:36,546
rectangular frame that the


512
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:38,276
animation should start from when


513
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,816
presenting and ending when


514
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,276
dismissing.


515
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:44,206
If possible, I suggest the final


516
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:46,126
or UIView to have a square


517
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:48,436
frame, to have the best seamless


518
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:48,926
transition.


519
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,746
AR Quick Look nicely handles the


520
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:53,506
transition from this view to the


521
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:54,606
full screen viewer on


522
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,696
presentation and dismissal,


523
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,356
creating this effect where the


524
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,166
model just magically appears.


525
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,486
And for an overall better


526
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:05,086
experience, I recommend using a


527
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,726
UI button as the view and


528
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,206
setting the thumbnail as the


529
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:10,086
button's image.


530
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,176
That way, you get visual


531
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:13,926
feedback whenever the view is


532
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:14,966
tapped with the button


533
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:16,806
highlight, and this is extremely


534
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:18,516
important so that the user knows


535
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:20,016
that some action is about to


536
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:20,326
happen.


537
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:24,376
And that is how to integrate AR


538
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:25,866
Quick Look into your iOS


539
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:26,426
application.


540
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,296
It's never been easier to


541
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:29,386
introduce AR preview and


542
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:34,086
capabilities in your apps today.


543
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:35,506
Now, let's talk about


544
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:37,016
integrating AR content on the


545
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:37,296
web.


546
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:40,016
We really want AR content to be


547
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:41,356
accessible online.


548
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:45,056
So, starting in iOS 12, Safari


549
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,246
has built-in support for


550
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:48,976
previewing usdz files in AR.


551
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,586
By hosting usdz files on your


552
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:52,726
website, you got a way of


553
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,556
delivering previews of 3D


554
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,056
objects.


555
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:56,936
So, not only can you read about


556
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:58,366
the object and see it through


557
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:59,556
the image, you can now


558
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:01,246
experience what the model looks


559
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:01,936
like in your world.


560
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,896
So, here, I have a modern


561
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,056
version of my online garden


562
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:08,006
store with various thumbnails of


563
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:08,945
gardening tools I have listed


564
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:09,296
for sale.


565
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:11,965
For better integration of AR on


566
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,836
my web content, I'll use the new


567
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:15,146
HTML markup that I'm about to


568
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:15,826
show you shortly.


569
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:17,756
This opens up and allows


570
00:17:17,756 --> 00:17:19,036
customers to preview my


571
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:20,715
gardening tools before they


572
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,616
actually purchase it.


573
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:24,576
So, by following this markup,


574
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,046
you had a badge that I mentioned


575
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,646
earlier, rendered on the image


576
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,606
in the top right-hand corner,


577
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:30,706
and this is useful and there to


578
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:32,076
tell you that our system viewer


579
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,506
is behind this so you can


580
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:35,246
preview my watering can in AR.


581
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:39,036
So, you can provide your own


582
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:40,636
cover artwork associated to the


583
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:41,996
3D object, and this can be a


584
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,996
portrait shot or nice hero image


585
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,176
like I've chosen for my lovely


586
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:45,926
watering can.


587
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:48,626
And with this flow, we support


588
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:53,066
drag and drop and, of course,


589
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,446
long-press Safari actions from


590
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,356
Safari like Add to Reading List


591
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:58,886
or Copy and Share.


592
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:03,946
And the best part is you get a


593
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:05,766
more immediate and optimized


594
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,626
workflow into AR Quick Look.


595
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:09,276
So, you're not following any


596
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:11,246
links, and you get a response


597
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:13,286
without updating your web URL.


598
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:17,866
The HTML Markup is very


599
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,256
straightforward and simple, and


600
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:19,736
this is it.


601
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,076
So, by adding this attribute,


602
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:23,956
this will turn your webpage into


603
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,266
an AR experience.


604
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,406
The requirement is an a elements


605
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,756
with rel=ar, and this tells


606
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,706
WebKit that this is AR content.


607
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,646
You then provide the link to the


608
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,496
location of the usdz file.


609
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:40,376
Lastly, we have a single child


610
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,636
that is the image element, and


611
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:43,936
this is the cover artwork that I


612
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,576
mentioned earlier about that you


613
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,326
provide as your thumbnail for


614
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,206
the 3D content.


615
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:50,766
The badge will appear above your


616
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,606
thumbnail image inviting you to


617
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,046
preview and it screens the


618
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,496
object in AR.


619
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:59,026
And this can also be done with


620
00:18:59,026 --> 00:18:59,696
the picture element.


621
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,886
Similar to the image element,


622
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:03,446
the rules here are single


623
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,076
picture child of the a rel=ar


624
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:06,386
tag.


625
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,476
The picture itself can have all


626
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:10,676
the children it needs, from


627
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:12,916
being very simple to having very


628
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,326
complicated roles about which


629
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:15,626
child source image it picks to


630
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,496
render based off of device,


631
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:20,756
size, and other platform logic.


632
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,516
usdz content must be served with


633
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,386
the correct media type, and so


634
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:28,896
make sure that the MIME type is


635
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,136
set for these files.


636
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,366
The registration of an official


637
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:33,536
type is in progress.


638
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:35,376
So, in the meantime, WebKit is


639
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,986
affecting both of these media


640
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:40,096
types if you're using Apache.


641
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:43,896
And that's how to integrate AR


642
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:44,386
Quick Look.


643
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,276
The goal was to make it really


644
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:48,356
easy to put AR everywhere, on


645
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,546
not just websites in Safari but


646
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,026
also in apps in iOS.


647
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,006
Now, you might be wondering


648
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:56,676
where can I get usdz content.


649
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,606
I'll invite my colleague Dave


650
00:19:58,606 --> 00:19:59,576
who will talk more about how to


651
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,236
create content for AR Quick


652
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:01,336
Look.


653
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:07,066
[ Applause ]


654
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:08,106
>> Thanks David.


655
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,356
Well, let's start by taking a


656
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:11,726
look at what it is that we want


657
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,246
to achieve with our 3D models.


658
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:15,866
Here, I have a model of a teapot


659
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,506
that I've loaded in AR Quick


660
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:19,256
Look, and we can see that it


661
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:20,976
sits perfectly on the ground, as


662
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:21,966
indicated by its shadow.


663
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,166
It spins around its natural


664
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,356
pivot point, the center of the


665
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,536
bowl, and if I place it in the


666
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,466
world, we can really believe


667
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:30,786
that it's there on the surface


668
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:31,416
in front of me.


669
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,456
We even see the environment


670
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:34,776
reflected in its shiny metal


671
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,076
handle.


672
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,786
So, how do we achieve this


673
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:39,166
effect with our 3D models?


674
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:41,606
Well, when we're creating our


675
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,326
models, there are six things we


676
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,576
need to get right, and we'll see


677
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,826
how to do each of these in the


678
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:46,616
remainder of the session.


679
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:48,566
We need to set the model's


680
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:51,766
placement, we need to set its


681
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,196
physical size to be correct in


682
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:55,316
AR, we need to create any


683
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:56,806
animation we want for our model,


684
00:20:57,646 --> 00:21:00,126
add its contact shadow, modify


685
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,096
its appearance, and then add any


686
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,256
transparency that our model


687
00:21:03,256 --> 00:21:03,706
needs.


688
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:05,676
Once these six things are done,


689
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:07,666
we can optimize and export our


690
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,126
models for use in AR Quick Look.


691
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,836
We'll start with placement, and


692
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,236
there are three things we need


693
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:15,936
to get right in our 3D software


694
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,076
to make our model appear


695
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:17,846
correctly in the world.


696
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:20,536
The first is that the object


697
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:21,916
should face toward the camera,


698
00:21:22,146 --> 00:21:23,046
toward positive z.


699
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:25,986
Secondly, the base of the object


700
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,406
should sit on the ground plane,


701
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,096
the plane where y = 0.


702
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,566
And finally, we should put its


703
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,186
natural pivot point at the


704
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:33,576
origin.


705
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:36,216
So, let's see how that looks for


706
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:36,896
a sample model.


707
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:38,896
Here, I'm in my 3D modeling


708
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:39,326
software.


709
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:41,426
I have the origin at the center.


710
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:43,876
I have positive x heading off to


711
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:46,186
the side, positive y heading up


712
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:48,216
from the origin, and positive z


713
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:51,166
toward the camera.


714
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,706
Now, if I import a model, if I


715
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:54,186
import my teapot without having


716
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:55,936
set it up, we can immediately


717
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:56,936
see there's a problem here.


718
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,126
The model is below the ground


719
00:21:59,156 --> 00:21:59,326
plane.


720
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:01,676
If we look at it from the side,


721
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:02,936
we can see this model has been


722
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:04,236
created around the origin.


723
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,746
So, let's move it up such that


724
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:08,346
its base is set on our plane


725
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:09,366
where y = 0.


726
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,906
And now, it's ready to position


727
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:11,956
in the world on the ground.


728
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:15,046
If we look at it from the front,


729
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:16,686
however, there are still some


730
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:17,986
esthetic improvements we can


731
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:18,426
make here.


732
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:20,056
This kind of looks like a


733
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:21,866
teapot, but it could look more


734
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:22,376
like a teapot.


735
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,766
This is what we think of when we


736
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:26,096
think of a teapot, with a spout


737
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:26,586
to the side.


738
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:28,886
When you're thinking how to


739
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:30,126
position your objects for this


740
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:32,026
optimal recognition, think how


741
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:33,366
you would place that object if


742
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,786
you put it on a shelf or in a


743
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,556
display cabinet.


744
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:39,196
If in doubt, ask a young child


745
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:40,606
to draw the object for you.


746
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:42,416
Chances are the profile they


747
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,496
choose is the one you should


748
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:43,766
use.


749
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:46,686
Now, this profile really


750
00:22:46,686 --> 00:22:47,106
matters.


751
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,156
Not only is it what people will


752
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:50,836
see when your object first loads


753
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,756
in our Quick Look, but it's also


754
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:53,876
the profile that's used for the


755
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:55,506
object's thumbnail, and these


756
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:57,056
two deliberately match when the


757
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,266
thumbnail is in files or in


758
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:58,816
messages.


759
00:22:59,056 --> 00:22:59,976
So, we get that seamless


760
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:01,206
transition between the two.


761
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:03,086
So, choosing a good profile is


762
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:03,786
really important.


763
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:07,076
We'll head back into our 3D


764
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:09,316
software and rotate our model so


765
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:10,346
the spout is to the side.


766
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:13,386
As one final check before we


767
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:15,446
export it, let's take a top-down


768
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:16,826
view and make sure that that


769
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,496
bowl is centered on the origin,


770
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:19,796
so it will spin around the point


771
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,636
we want it to.


772
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:24,276
The second thing we want to set


773
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:25,996
up for our model is its physical


774
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:26,456
size.


775
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,916
Here, I have a gramophone record


776
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,706
player, and size matters here.


777
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:32,406
This record player is designed


778
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:34,086
to play 12-inch records, so we


779
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,106
need to make sure it's the right


780
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:35,786
size in the world.


781
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:38,976
If I export this model and load


782
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:40,766
it in object mode in AR Quick


783
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,496
Look, it looks great because we


784
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:43,756
always scale models to fit in


785
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,146
this mode.


786
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:46,126
But if I place it in the world,


787
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:47,576
we can see there's a problem


788
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:49,136
when I put it next to a 12-inch


789
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:49,496
record.


790
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:50,806
It's far too small.


791
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:52,786
Right now, it's set up to play


792
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:54,416
6-inch records, and they don't


793
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:54,836
exist.


794
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:58,226
So, let's head back into my 3D


795
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,306
software and create a reference,


796
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,566
12-inch cylinder.


797
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:04,016
Now, I know this is exactly 12


798
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:05,636
inches in diameter because I


799
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:06,956
know the units that this project


800
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:07,506
is working in.


801
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:09,896
I can use this reference


802
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,916
cylinder to resize my turntable


803
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,676
and make sure that the platter


804
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:15,196
is exactly the right size to


805
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:16,806
play a 12-inch record.


806
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,316
Having done so, if I re-export


807
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:21,156
my model, it looks exactly the


808
00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:22,646
same in object mode because it's


809
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:23,646
still scaled to fit.


810
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:25,236
But when I place it in the


811
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:27,136
world, we can now see it's the


812
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,796
right size to play this 12-inch


813
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:29,146
record.


814
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:30,776
We could imagine picking it up


815
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:31,656
and placing it on that


816
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:31,976
turntable.


817
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:37,206
Now, not all objects have a


818
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:38,206
natural size.


819
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:40,506
This little guy is Chatterbox,


820
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,026
and he doesn't exist in the real


821
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:42,296
world.


822
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:43,536
He only exists in our


823
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:44,196
imaginations.


824
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,306
But he's pretty cute, and he has


825
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:47,866
a fun animation, and he's good


826
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:48,836
to take a photo with.


827
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,456
So, we've created him at desktop


828
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,196
size, which makes him easy to


829
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:54,396
place in the world in common


830
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,756
environments, then people can


831
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:58,586
resize him, shrink him down.


832
00:24:58,906 --> 00:24:59,956
They can move him around or


833
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,296
scale him up and make him the


834
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:02,466
size they want him to be for a


835
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:02,916
photo.


836
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,216
But by making him desktop size


837
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:06,986
by default, he's always easy to


838
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:07,406
place.


839
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,886
We saw here that Chatterbox has


840
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:13,986
animation, and this is something


841
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:15,236
we recommend you use where it


842
00:25:15,236 --> 00:25:16,536
helps to bring that object to


843
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:18,386
life with an idle animation that


844
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,506
makes it feel more like it's in


845
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:19,906
the world.


846
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:23,266
Note that animations always


847
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:25,556
loop, and the animations you


848
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:26,936
could create can use skeletal


849
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:28,876
and/or transform animation to


850
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:30,906
bring them to life.


851
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,136
Here's another example.


852
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:34,166
This is a cartoon style chicken


853
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,406
character without animation, and


854
00:25:36,506 --> 00:25:38,276
if I place him in the world, he


855
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:40,276
looks pretty cool, but he's kind


856
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:40,756
of static.


857
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:42,146
He doesn't really feel like he's


858
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,446
alive there in the room with me.


859
00:25:44,216 --> 00:25:45,926
So, there's more we can do here.


860
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:48,426
So, if we add a little bit of


861
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:49,686
skeletal animation to our


862
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:50,956
character to make him bob his


863
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:53,376
head, now when we place him in


864
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:55,036
the world, he feels much more


865
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:56,286
realistic, much more like he's


866
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:58,106
there on the table in front of


867
00:25:59,656 --> 00:25:59,736
me.


868
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:01,716
Some tips as you add animation


869
00:26:01,716 --> 00:26:02,306
to your models.


870
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:04,986
Firstly, choose animations that


871
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:06,796
enhance the AR immersiveness,


872
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,946
that make you feel more like


873
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:08,876
that object is there in the


874
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:08,976
room.


875
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:11,826
Now, because people can


876
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:13,306
manipulate your objects, they


877
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,996
can retape them, scale them, and


878
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:17,206
move them around, it's important


879
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:18,296
not to move them away from the


880
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:18,696
origin.


881
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,306
If I create a car that zooms


882
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:22,806
around in a meter-wide circle,


883
00:26:23,486 --> 00:26:24,386
when someone tries to put their


884
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:25,566
finger on that car to pick it


885
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:27,176
up, it's already moved away and


886
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:28,026
zooms somewhere else.


887
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,256
So, that gesture is very


888
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,576
confusing to somebody trying to


889
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:31,496
manipulate that object.


890
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:33,306
So, try and keep those objects


891
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,156
centered at the origin.


892
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:37,536
For the same reasons, try and


893
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:39,176
keep a consistent bounding box


894
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:40,096
throughout the animation as


895
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:40,316
well.


896
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:42,016
Even if the object is at one


897
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:44,036
location, it's much easier for


898
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,606
me to manipulate it if it stays


899
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:46,496
in the same place under my


900
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,116
fingers throughout the entire


901
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:48,496
gesture.


902
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:53,016
As a result, prefer animations


903
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,446
that make sense at a static


904
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:54,936
location.


905
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,516
If you have a T-rex character,


906
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,256
rather than giving it a walk


907
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:00,656
cycle that would make it look


908
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:01,706
like it was running on the spot,


909
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:03,946
make it roar or stamp its feet


910
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:05,316
or something else that makes


911
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:06,526
sense at a static location.


912
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:09,396
Now, there is an alternative.


913
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,826
You can also consider creating


914
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:13,216
animations as self-contained


915
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,636
scenes to help with these


916
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:15,636
gesture manipulations.


917
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:17,256
And let's see an example of how


918
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:17,756
that can work.


919
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,566
Here, I have a swimming koi


920
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:22,236
fish, and it makes sense for


921
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:23,176
this fish to have some


922
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:23,786
translation.


923
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:25,806
So, we created a scene with an


924
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:28,106
aquarium base, and this means


925
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,336
when we place this in the world,


926
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:31,986
if we rotate it, or if we move


927
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:34,256
it, the scene we're manipulating


928
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:36,566
is the scene, not the fish, and


929
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:37,916
so the gesture makes a lot more


930
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:38,176
sense.


931
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:40,916
It also means by having a base


932
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,156
to our scene that we have a


933
00:27:42,156 --> 00:27:43,486
consistent bounding box


934
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:44,876
throughout the entire animation.


935
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:48,846
Another thing that really brings


936
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:49,996
your models to life in the world


937
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,576
is that contact shadow.


938
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,496
Now, note here that AR Quick


939
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,886
Look provides the contact shadow


940
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:56,386
for you.


941
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,536
This means that it can turn the


942
00:27:58,536 --> 00:27:59,976
shadow on and off as you


943
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:00,976
transition between modes.


944
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:03,196
It also means it can apply


945
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,116
ambient lighting conditions to


946
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,836
the shadow as the lighting


947
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:07,616
changes around you.


948
00:28:08,816 --> 00:28:10,606
Because of this, don't bake a


949
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,166
contact shadow into the models


950
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:12,676
you provide.


951
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:14,626
If you do, you'll end up with


952
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:14,976
two shadows.


953
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:19,196
Note also that the first frame


954
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:20,846
of any animation is used to


955
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:22,326
create the shadow for a model,


956
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,596
and sometimes this means it's


957
00:28:24,596 --> 00:28:25,626
important to choose the right


958
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:26,176
first frame.


959
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:29,206
We'll see an example.


960
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:30,556
Here, I have a model of a


961
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:32,536
Newton's cradle, a desktop type,


962
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:34,476
and it has a swinging animation,


963
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:35,716
a transform animation to bring


964
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:36,256
it to life.


965
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:39,356
Now, if we freeze this with its


966
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:41,176
first frame, here the first


967
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:42,046
frame has one of the ball


968
00:28:42,046 --> 00:28:43,796
bearings out to the side, we can


969
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:44,586
see there's a problem.


970
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:47,106
The shadow we've generated from


971
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:48,716
this first frame also has that


972
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:49,986
ball bearing out to the side.


973
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:52,546
And so, if we animate to the


974
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:54,076
other extreme of this animation,


975
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:55,606
at this point, the shadow


976
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:58,486
doesn't really make sense.


977
00:28:58,656 --> 00:29:00,686
Now, because animations loop, we


978
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:01,606
could choose a different


979
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:02,936
starting point, a more neutral


980
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:03,966
one where the ball's in the


981
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:06,016
center and still have the same


982
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,166
animation, the same overall


983
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:07,496
effect.


984
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,676
But now, by choosing a better


985
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:11,386
first frame, our shadow makes


986
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,306
sense throughout the entire


987
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:12,756
animation.


988
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:17,136
One of the biggest things we can


989
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:18,866
modify about our model to make


990
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:20,786
it feel real in the world is the


991
00:29:20,786 --> 00:29:21,806
model's appearance.


992
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:25,486
Now, here, AR Quick Look uses a


993
00:29:25,486 --> 00:29:27,076
Physically Based Rendering, or


994
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:29,206
PBR shader, and this gives us


995
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:30,706
six things that we can modify


996
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,406
about our model's appearance to


997
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:33,836
make it feel more real in the


998
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:34,146
world.


999
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:36,206
We do this by providing


1000
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:37,666
textures, images, for each of


1001
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,866
these six things if we want to.


1002
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:41,996
The first is the model's albedo.


1003
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:43,916
This is the base color of the


1004
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,816
model, its underlying color.


1005
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:48,486
The second is indicating which


1006
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,076
parts of the model are metallic.


1007
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,076
This changes whether they are a


1008
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,836
conductor or an insulator, which


1009
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,126
changes how they interact with


1010
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,236
the physics of light in the real


1011
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:56,596
world.


1012
00:29:58,026 --> 00:29:59,796
We could also specify which


1013
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:01,416
parts of our model are rough or


1014
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:02,996
shiny by providing a roughness


1015
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:03,366
texture.


1016
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,246
We can add in a normal map.


1017
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:08,056
This creates the illusion of


1018
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:09,326
depth and variances within the


1019
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:11,176
surfaces, the model's surface,


1020
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:12,606
without changing the underlying


1021
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:13,026
mesh.


1022
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:16,086
We can add an ambient occlusion


1023
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:17,896
texture to specify where the


1024
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:19,746
model casts shadows on itself in


1025
00:30:19,746 --> 00:30:21,036
the crevices and nooks and


1026
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:21,776
crannies of the model.


1027
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:24,726
And if our model emits lights,


1028
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,306
we can provide an emissive


1029
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:27,916
texture for things like a TV


1030
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,346
screen or a computer monitor.


1031
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:32,276
Now, if you're just getting


1032
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:34,456
started with PBR, we have a


1033
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:35,886
session on Thursday about


1034
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,006
creating PBR-based models for


1035
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:39,826
any AR experience, and I highly


1036
00:30:39,826 --> 00:30:40,726
recommend you check it out.


1037
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,366
For now, we'll take a look at


1038
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:45,306
how these six textures affect AR


1039
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:46,456
Quick Look particularly.


1040
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:49,566
So, I'll start with a model of a


1041
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:50,056
TV.


1042
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,106
Right now, it has no textures.


1043
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:53,586
It's pretty bland.


1044
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:57,356
We'll bring in an albedo texture


1045
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:59,386
to give it some base color, and


1046
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:00,746
it's much more recognizable as a


1047
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:02,786
TV now, but it's still very


1048
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:03,066
flat.


1049
00:31:03,346 --> 00:31:04,426
It doesn't feel realistic.


1050
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:07,976
The next thing we'll do is to


1051
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:10,166
introduce a metallic texture to


1052
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:11,416
make the trim around the TV


1053
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,666
screen and the antenna on top to


1054
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,776
indicate that they're made from


1055
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:15,086
metal.


1056
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:17,266
Note here that our metallic


1057
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:18,946
texture is pretty much black and


1058
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:19,186
white.


1059
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:21,166
Things either are a metal, or


1060
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:21,436
they aren't.


1061
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,206
But the metal still doesn't look


1062
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:25,386
as realistic as we want it to


1063
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,886
do, and that's because the


1064
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,606
metal, like all of the model, is


1065
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:29,766
entirely rough.


1066
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,356
There's no shine, there's no


1067
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:32,916
smooth surfaces on this TV right


1068
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:32,983
now.


1069
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:37,106
To fix that, we'll bring in a


1070
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:39,176
roughness texture, and at this


1071
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,316
point the model really comes to


1072
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:40,626
life.


1073
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:43,076
The metal around the TV screen


1074
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:44,506
and the aerial now looks like


1075
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:44,876
metal.


1076
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,786
It looks like chrome, and the


1077
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:48,486
wood on the top of our TV


1078
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:49,646
actually looks like it has a


1079
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:51,056
varnish or lacquer effect.


1080
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:52,266
We can believe it much more


1081
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:54,686
realistically as a TV.


1082
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:55,946
And roughness is one of the


1083
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,426
biggest points of creative


1084
00:31:57,426 --> 00:31:58,696
control you have over the look


1085
00:31:58,696 --> 00:31:59,936
of your model and how it feels


1086
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:00,646
in the real world.


1087
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,196
And you'll see, we have quite a


1088
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:03,476
lot of variance in our roughness


1089
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,726
texture, even within the same


1090
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,446
parts of the model, to give more


1091
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:07,516
realism and to bring it more to


1092
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:07,736
life.


1093
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,676
Next, we'll add a normal map to


1094
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:14,036
add the illusion of variance,


1095
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:15,866
particularly in the woodgrain on


1096
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:16,846
top of the TV here.


1097
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:18,376
The underlying mesh hasn't


1098
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,286
changed, but it feels more 3D.


1099
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:21,616
Also, on the speaker grill.


1100
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,506
Because we have some crevices


1101
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:26,686
and some hidden areas on the


1102
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:28,076
front of the TV that would cast


1103
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,876
shadows on themselves, we'll add


1104
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:31,516
in an ambient occlusion texture.


1105
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,066
The effect is pretty subtle, but


1106
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,206
it does add to the depth of the


1107
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:36,906
model and make it feel more real


1108
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:37,796
when it's in the world.


1109
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:41,116
And because this is a TV with a


1110
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:43,176
screen, we'll add an emissive


1111
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,056
texture as well to indicate that


1112
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,456
the screen emits light into the


1113
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:46,786
world.


1114
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,356
The effect of this is best seen


1115
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:50,696
when pushing the object into a


1116
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:51,006
room.


1117
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,136
Here, we can see that the main


1118
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:54,706
body of the TV reflects the


1119
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:55,876
ambient lighting conditions of


1120
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,466
the room it's in, but the screen


1121
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:58,016
is brighter.


1122
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,746
It's actually emitting light.


1123
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:02,266
Emissive texture is a fairly


1124
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,606
special case but not something


1125
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,636
you'd use every day.


1126
00:33:05,436 --> 00:33:06,326
But if the object you're


1127
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:07,656
modeling would glow if you


1128
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:09,116
turned the lights off, it might


1129
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,056
be a good candidate for an


1130
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:10,716
emissive texture.


1131
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:14,446
We can also make parts of our


1132
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:15,596
models transparent.


1133
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,366
This is useful for making


1134
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:18,516
objects made out of partly


1135
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:19,296
glass, for example.


1136
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,686
If you do this, be sure to use a


1137
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:24,256
separate material for the


1138
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:25,986
transparent and non-transparent


1139
00:33:25,986 --> 00:33:27,366
parts of your model to ensure


1140
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:28,116
they render correctly.


1141
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:31,366
You do this by providing an


1142
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:32,736
albedo texture that has the


1143
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:34,156
transparency in its alpha


1144
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:34,536
channel.


1145
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:36,666
So, a transparent PNG file, for


1146
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,056
example.


1147
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:40,046
Note that transparency is really


1148
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:41,726
intended for see-through parts


1149
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:43,216
of the model, not for creating


1150
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:44,796
cutouts like a leaf edge or a


1151
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:45,396
butterfly wing.


1152
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:48,896
We'll see this in action for our


1153
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:50,196
TV model from before.


1154
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,336
In addition to the mesh we


1155
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:53,596
already have for the base of the


1156
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:55,806
model, I'm going to add a second


1157
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,436
mesh for a curved screen, a


1158
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:58,416
screen cover that's made of


1159
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,346
glass, with a slight amount of


1160
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,206
dirt on the screen.


1161
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:04,606
Here's how it looks in AR Quick


1162
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:04,816
Look.


1163
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:06,816
We can see that the light


1164
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:08,016
reflects on the screen and


1165
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,505
shines off the curved surface,


1166
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,085
and if we turn it to the side,


1167
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:12,416
we can see the color of the


1168
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:13,596
screen there as well where the


1169
00:34:13,596 --> 00:34:15,346
glass as some grime to it.


1170
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:18,255
We achieve this by using this


1171
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,235
kind of texture for our screen.


1172
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:21,426
It's pretty simple.


1173
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:22,536
It's just adding that small


1174
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:23,126
amount of dirt.


1175
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,666
But crucially, it has the


1176
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,866
transparency in its alpha


1177
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:27,146
channel to indicate that the


1178
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:28,346
screen is see-through, and we


1179
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:29,916
can see the main screen behind


1180
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:29,983
it.


1181
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:33,906
When you are setting up the


1182
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,775
textures for these individual


1183
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:36,326
properties.


1184
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,556
These are the formats to use.


1185
00:34:38,485 --> 00:34:41,166
Albedo should RGB, or RBGA, if


1186
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:41,815
you're also providing


1187
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:42,476
transparency.


1188
00:34:43,126 --> 00:34:44,646
Normal and emissive should also


1189
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:45,146
be RGB.


1190
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,496
And metallic roughness and


1191
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:48,466
ambient occlusion should be


1192
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:48,876
Greyscale.


1193
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:51,896
You can use any image format


1194
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:54,246
supported on iOS, and note that


1195
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:55,676
these textures should be square.


1196
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:56,856
They should be powers of 2


1197
00:34:56,856 --> 00:34:57,266
squared.


1198
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:04,146
So, 2k, 1k, 512 pixels, so on.


1199
00:35:04,426 --> 00:35:06,386
David mentioned earlier that AR


1200
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:07,956
Quick Look is available on all


1201
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:10,756
devices that support iOS 12, and


1202
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:12,036
this is actually quite a range


1203
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:13,176
of devices with different


1204
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:13,816
capabilities.


1205
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,856
Now, because AR Quick Look is a


1206
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:20,076
system-wide extension, this


1207
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,206
means it has to share the


1208
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,736
available system memory with the


1209
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:24,026
applications that launch it.


1210
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:26,046
And so, there's only so much


1211
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,866
memory available to display and


1212
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:28,626
load these models.


1213
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:32,586
To help with this, we recommend


1214
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:34,366
that you create and optimize and


1215
00:35:34,446 --> 00:35:36,376
test your models for high memory


1216
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:38,786
devices like the iPhone 7 Plus,


1217
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:41,706
8 Plus, and X, and the iPad Pro


1218
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:42,816
12.9 inch.


1219
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,956
If you do this, AR Quick Look


1220
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:47,736
will dynamically downsample the


1221
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,346
textures in your model for other


1222
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:50,206
devices of different


1223
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:51,556
capabilities, if needed.


1224
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:53,216
This means you can make the


1225
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,626
devices, your models look great


1226
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,076
on those devices but still know


1227
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:56,776
they'll work everywhere.


1228
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:59,786
Know that the meshes and the


1229
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:01,156
animations won't be modified.


1230
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:02,496
It's only the textures that will


1231
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:02,976
be downsampled.


1232
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:07,576
You're probably thinking at this


1233
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:09,506
point, okay, so how big can my


1234
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:09,986
model be?


1235
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:11,706
How big and complex can my


1236
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:12,286
textures be?


1237
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:15,146
And the answer is there is no


1238
00:36:15,146 --> 00:36:15,626
one answer.


1239
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:17,986
Many factors affect a model's


1240
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:19,786
memory usage, its mesh, and its


1241
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,436
animation complexity, and its


1242
00:36:21,436 --> 00:36:22,576
textures size and count.


1243
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:26,536
But as a guide, for a model that


1244
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:28,716
has a single PBR texture, using


1245
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:30,126
those six textures we saw


1246
00:36:30,126 --> 00:36:32,116
earlier on, if you aim for about


1247
00:36:32,336 --> 00:36:35,606
100k polygons, one set of 2k by


1248
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:38,136
2k PBR textures and about ten


1249
00:36:38,136 --> 00:36:39,956
seconds of animation, this is


1250
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:40,916
typically good for those


1251
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,216
high-memory devices we mentioned


1252
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:42,576
earlier on.


1253
00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:45,976
If in doubt, always test your


1254
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:47,786
model on a device to make sure


1255
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:49,166
that it renders and loads as you


1256
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,116
would expect.


1257
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:53,736
As you optimize your models for


1258
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:55,336
use in AR Quick Look, a few


1259
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:56,906
things to keep in mind.


1260
00:36:57,636 --> 00:36:59,316
Do be sure to freeze any


1261
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:00,656
transforms in your models and


1262
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:01,956
merge any adjacent vertices to


1263
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:03,576
tidy them up ready for export.


1264
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:06,306
And if you can, try and use a


1265
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:08,086
single material and texture set


1266
00:37:08,086 --> 00:37:08,976
for the entire model.


1267
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:11,526
This enables you to optimize how


1268
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:12,866
you pack the different parts of


1269
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:14,456
that model into those square


1270
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:15,396
textures that you're using.


1271
00:37:15,926 --> 00:37:18,666
And if you don't need a texture,


1272
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:21,416
don't include it.


1273
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:22,256
If none of the parts of your


1274
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:23,266
model are made from metal,


1275
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:24,336
there's no need to provide a


1276
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:25,076
metallic texture.


1277
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,866
The default is non-metallic for


1278
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:28,306
any model that's loaded.


1279
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,846
When you're choosing where to


1280
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:32,116
spend your texture budget,


1281
00:37:32,616 --> 00:37:34,236
prioritize the areas that give


1282
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:35,876
most realism to that model.


1283
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:38,046
For some models, that might be a


1284
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:39,646
high-resolution albedo texture.


1285
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,116
For others, it might be better


1286
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,886
spent on roughness or the normal


1287
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:42,976
map.


1288
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:46,636
And remember the pixels actually


1289
00:37:46,636 --> 00:37:48,486
have a physical size in AR.


1290
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:50,856
If you're printing a model of a


1291
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:52,206
thimble, and it's one inch


1292
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,566
across, there's probably no need


1293
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,376
to use a 2k by 2k texture for


1294
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:56,443
it.


1295
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:58,116
Those pixels will be tiny in the


1296
00:37:58,116 --> 00:37:59,186
real world.


1297
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:02,156
And although we want models to


1298
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,986
look great, we also need to


1299
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:05,866
balance texture size and quality


1300
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,846
against file size.


1301
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:08,496
If a model is being downloaded


1302
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:10,056
from a website, we want it to be


1303
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:11,646
a good size for downloading and


1304
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,376
also for sharing via messages


1305
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,006
and mail and other means.


1306
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:18,796
So, with all of that in mind,


1307
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:20,416
how do we make these things?


1308
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:23,276
Well for this, we have a usdz


1309
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:24,026
Converter.


1310
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:26,806
This is a command line tool that


1311
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,976
will convert existing 3D models


1312
00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:30,286
to usdz format.


1313
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:34,516
It ships inside Xcode 10, and in


1314
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:36,556
addition to creating usdz files,


1315
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:38,726
you could also use it to map PBR


1316
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:40,646
textures to the meshes and


1317
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:42,176
submeshes inside those existing


1318
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,476
models.


1319
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:47,226
It's X3 input format, OBJ files,


1320
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:49,706
Alembic files, and existing USD


1321
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:52,736
files, either USDA or USDC, the


1322
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:54,586
ASCII and binary versions of


1323
00:38:55,106 --> 00:38:55,206
USD.


1324
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:58,456
Before we create one, let's take


1325
00:38:58,456 --> 00:38:59,396
a look at what it is we're going


1326
00:38:59,396 --> 00:38:59,736
to make.


1327
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,586
Let's look inside a usdz file.


1328
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,406
In essence, these are


1329
00:39:04,406 --> 00:39:06,146
uncompressed zip archives.


1330
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:09,626
The first file is always a usdc


1331
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:10,016
file.


1332
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:12,236
This contains the model's mesh,


1333
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:13,936
its animation, if it has some,


1334
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,536
and any material definitions it


1335
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:15,726
needs.


1336
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:17,936
And then, the remainder of the


1337
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:19,916
files in the archive are any


1338
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:21,276
textures, any images, like the


1339
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,876
ones we saw earlier on.


1340
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:25,446
If you're thinking of creating


1341
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,666
your own tooling to build usdz


1342
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,406
files, the great news is that


1343
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:30,246
this is that this is an open


1344
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:32,436
format and Pixar have published


1345
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:33,856
the direct specification for


1346
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:36,536
usdz on the graphics.pixar.com


1347
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:37,206
site.


1348
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,446
To create one with a usdz


1349
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:42,486
converter, first note that we


1350
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:44,476
call the tool with xcrun because


1351
00:39:44,476 --> 00:39:45,556
it shifts inside Xcode.


1352
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:47,516
We pass in the name of the model


1353
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:49,436
we want to convert, an OBJ file


1354
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:51,206
in this case, and the file name


1355
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:52,866
of the usdz we want to have the


1356
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:53,706
other end.


1357
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:56,766
To map PBR textures to the


1358
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:59,246
meshes they're in, we use the -g


1359
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:00,816
option, followed by the name of


1360
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,216
one of the groups, a mesh or a


1361
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:03,506
submesh that we want to map them


1362
00:40:03,506 --> 00:40:05,356
to, and then we can provide any


1363
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:06,706
number of these textures for


1364
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:07,456
that particular group.


1365
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:10,326
To map multiple textures to


1366
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:12,036
multiple groups, we can use the


1367
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:13,586
-g option multiple times, as


1368
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:15,126
many as we need, to map all the


1369
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:15,886
textures in our model.


1370
00:40:16,426 --> 00:40:18,406
And if you're not sure what the


1371
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:19,646
groups in your model are called,


1372
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:22,026
you can pass in the -v option


1373
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:23,176
for verbose output.


1374
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:24,496
This will print the names of the


1375
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:26,016
groups that we find in the model


1376
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,596
plus useful other information


1377
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:28,636
about the conversion process.


1378
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,696
In addition to making your own


1379
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,536
models, we've also put together


1380
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:36,546
a gallery of example models that


1381
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:37,826
show good practices for PBR.


1382
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:40,546
If you visit this gallery in an


1383
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:42,706
iOS 12 device, you can tap any


1384
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,306
of these models, open them in AR


1385
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:45,616
Quick Look, and place them in


1386
00:40:45,616 --> 00:40:45,936
the world.


1387
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:48,856
This gallery also showcases the


1388
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:50,186
Safari integration that David


1389
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:50,946
showed you earlier on.


1390
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:53,436
So, if you have iOS 12 on a


1391
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:54,706
device, visit


1392
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:57,966
develop@apple.com/arkit/gallery


1393
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:01,816
and give them a try.


1394
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:05,166
So, in summary, AR Quick Look is


1395
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,016
a system-wide way to view AR


1396
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,466
content in the real world.


1397
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:10,936
It can be integrated into your


1398
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,216
own apps and websites.


1399
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:16,076
It uses the usdz file format for


1400
00:41:16,076 --> 00:41:17,466
3D model distribution and


1401
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:17,856
sharing.


1402
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:21,436
It supports PBR, animation, and


1403
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:24,336
transparency, and you can use


1404
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:25,506
the usdz converter tool that


1405
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:27,366
ships in Xcode 10 to convert


1406
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:29,616
your existing models to usdz.


1407
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:31,676
For more information on the


1408
00:41:31,676 --> 00:41:33,156
subjects in this talk, check out


1409
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:33,936
the session's website.


1410
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:36,306
And we also have ARKit labs


1411
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:36,886
throughout the week.


1412
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:38,036
So, please do bring any


1413
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:39,256
questions you have about AR


1414
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:40,376
Quick Look, and we'd be really


1415
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:41,526
happy to help you answer them.


1416
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:42,846
Thank you.


1417
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:47,500
