morning everyone.

[ Applause ]


4
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:20,186
My name is Mike Stern.


5
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:24,676
I'm Apple's User Experience
Evangelist and I'm really happy


6
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:27,996
to be talking again today
about design for iOS.


7
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,796
Now, if you saw my
talk on Wednesday,


8
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:33,066
you heard me speak a
lot about the difference


9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,326
between iOS 6 and iOS 7.


10
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:39,776
Well today, we're going talk
about Evergreen Design advice.


11
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,486
So this is advice that is
relevant if you're making an app


12
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:48,506
for iOS 7 but it was
relevant for 6 and 5


13
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:53,326
and every version
of iOS before that.


14
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:57,326
So, as many of you know,
we spend a lot of time


15
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:00,616
and energy creating
apps at Apple.


16
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,806
We focus on it, we
want to make sure


17
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:06,196
that user experience
is really fantastic.


18
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:11,866
And I've been a designer at
Apple for seven years and I know


19
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:15,486
at first hand how much care and
thought goes into the design


20
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:18,186
of each one of our
apps, and it shows.


21
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:24,306
Our users have come to expect
experiences that are intuitive,


22
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:33,516
engaging, beautiful, and
sometimes a bit magical.


23
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:41,766
And you guys heard all week long
about the great new technologies


24
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:44,416
that you could take advantage
of for designing your apps.


25
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:48,356
And I hope you guys learned
a lot and have come away


26
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:51,086
from this week really inspired
to try some of these new things.


27
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,596
But the thing I want
to remind you of is


28
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:56,936
that your users aren't going
to judge your apps based


29
00:01:56,936 --> 00:02:01,956
on how many technologies you use
or how many APIs you integrated


30
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:03,756
or how elegant your code is.


31
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,256
The way they're going to
judge your app is based


32
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:11,526
on what enables them to
do, how it makes them feel.


33
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:16,016
So with that in mind, it's
really important that the design


34
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:20,006
of your app has the same
qualities of being intuitive


35
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,396
and engaging and beautiful.


36
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:27,436
And we saw on Monday,
some of the winners


37
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:34,346
of the Apple Design Awards, apps
like ProCreate, WWF Together,


38
00:02:34,556 --> 00:02:37,676
Ridiculous Fishing,
Badland, Yahoo!


39
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:39,186
Weather, and Letterpress.


40
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:45,566
These apps, they set the bar for
high quality user experience.


41
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:51,266
I worked on this a little
bit and I got to see dozens,


42
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:54,206
hundreds of apps
that we considered


43
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:58,166
for the final selection and
it was a really tough choice.


44
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,156
There's so many great apps
being designed for iOS,


45
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,576
many of them only for iOS.


46
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:08,056
But this is tough competition.


47
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:09,546
So how do you get here?


48
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,666
How do you start going
in this direction?


49
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:20,256
Now, I look at a lot of apps
all the time and I see some


50
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:22,766
of the same mistakes being
made over and over again.


51
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,446
And as we know, a lot
of apps get rejected


52
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:30,026
from the App Store
during the review process.


53
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:35,676
In fact, it's one of the top
three reasons why apps get


54
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:37,646
rejected-- why apps
will get rejected.


55
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,306
So, I'd like to head
that off at the pass,


56
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,806
try to provide some advice
to streamline the process


57
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:46,046
and prevent your apps
from getting rejected.


58
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:52,066
And in order to do that, got
a little ahead on myself,


59
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:56,046
we're going to look at 10
common pitfalls that I see over


60
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:56,916
and over and over again.


61
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:00,226
And the first one
is bad app icons.


62
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:04,566
So this is the first place
that most people are going


63
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,636
to encounter your app.


64
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,116
They're going to search for
something and your app is going


65
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,346
to come up in the results
alongside dozens and dozens


66
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:15,386
of other apps, and you have
to standout from the crowd.


67
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:17,536
This is a search for camera,


68
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:19,125
I just did this couple
of weeks ago.


69
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:22,156
And I bet there're some
icons here that are standing


70
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:25,626
out better than others, that
you noticed first immediately,


71
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:26,936
right when we got to the slide.


72
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:29,586
And that's not unlike
what happens


73
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:33,206
when you did the search yourself
at home on your computer.


74
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,436
Things are going to
draw your eye in,


75
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:40,416
and you immediately begin
to make a lot of assumptions


76
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:44,556
about the user experience of
these apps, so you'll look


77
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:46,906
at them and start to
make these inferences


78
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:49,826
about how enjoyable
they're going to be to use,


79
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,716
how intuitive the
interface is going to be,


80
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:54,826
how well it's going
to serve your needs.


81
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:56,546
And I think those are kind


82
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,626
of reasonable assumptions
actually to make from an icon.


83
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,556
I mean, if an icon looks great


84
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:04,806
and it obviously was carefully
crafted, it's reasonable


85
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:09,146
to assume that the rest of the
design of the app is also great


86
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:10,636
and also well crafted.


87
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,316
But it goes beyond that.


88
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,866
People start to make all sorts


89
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,576
of other assumptions
about your app.


90
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,366
How good the technology is.


91
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,426
How secure your data is.


92
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,216
How performant it is.


93
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:24,366
Is it stable?


94
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:29,146
Is it going to have
functionality which is ahead--


95
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:32,236
you know, advanced better
than the competition?


96
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,356
So with that in mind,


97
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:38,526
an app icon is really an
important thing to focus on.


98
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:40,916
And what are the qualities


99
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,536
that distinguish a
really great app icon?


100
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,506
Well, there's two main things.


101
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:50,326
One, it's beautiful and I think
probably more importantly,


102
00:05:50,326 --> 00:05:52,076
it's instantly recognizable.


103
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,196
So how do you accomplish that?


104
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,646
Well, there're six things
that I want to point


105
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,696
out that are important
to keep in mind.


106
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:04,196
I think they distinguish
every great app icon.


107
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:09,336
The first, focus
on unique shape.


108
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,746
These four icons, they
do different things,


109
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:16,146
some are very simple
or with solid colors,


110
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:17,326
or just a clean gradient.


111
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,206
Others are a little bit more
complex but they all start


112
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:24,106
with this very basic
shape, and that allows them


113
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:26,776
to be recognizable
at a great distance.


114
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,476
So you guys in the back


115
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:31,216
of the room right now are
having a really easy time making


116
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:35,386
out what the shape of these
icons is, and that's important.


117
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,776
Icons are seen at
all different sizes.


118
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:42,166
You know, it's not just the
size you see in the store,


119
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,866
it gets smaller on the
home screen and smaller


120
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,076
on the notification center


121
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,536
and it's really small
inside the groups.


122
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:50,196
So you have to make sure
that the imaging you choose


123
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:52,366
for your app icon is kind
of reduce really well


124
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,416
and be clear at any size.


125
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,936
The next step is to just
choose a limited pallet,


126
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,936
one color, maybe two.


127
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:07,856
Now, there're app icons that
have much more than one color


128
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:11,296
or two but it's really
complicated to pull off right.


129
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,456
We'll see an example of it in
a few moments and I'll point it


130
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:17,186
out when we get there,
but notice these icons,


131
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:21,016
just really one color and
it has variations and tone


132
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:24,766
but they stand out,
they're not fragmented.


133
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:30,316
Now, the next one is to
avoid using photography


134
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,246
in your app icon.


135
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,796
I've seen it a number of times


136
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,816
and it never works
out well in the end.


137
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:39,186
So let's take for example,
you're making an app


138
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,496
for wine lovers, to take notes
about the wines they like


139
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:45,866
and share with others.


140
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:49,076
So you might be tempted to
start with something like this,


141
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:53,556
nice glass of red wine
and you just crop it,


142
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:57,446
put some rounded corners on
it, throw a gradient over it.


143
00:07:57,996 --> 00:07:59,516
Does anyone think
that looks good?


144
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:01,526
Looks terrible.


145
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:05,716
So you-- but, you know,
if you want your icon


146
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:09,706
to have these features, that's
fine, just illustrate it,


147
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:13,736
take it to the next level,
hire a good app icon designer,


148
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,156
who can pull this off well.


149
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:18,696
And that's exactly what
the people at Sipp did,


150
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:23,816
hired a really talented
designer named Eddie Lobanovskiy


151
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:27,686
and he made this fantastic
illustration for their app icon.


152
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:32,626
It has the same elements as that
photo, it's got the red wine,


153
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,785
it's got the glass, it's
got the wood texture


154
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:40,956
that evokes the barrel, but
the composition is really solid


155
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,826
and it's also really creative.


156
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:50,376
And these are two values that we
cherished at Apple, creativity


157
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:53,186
and attention to
detail, and of course,


158
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:56,976
the way that red wine swishes
around and forms the letter S,


159
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:03,826
the mnemonic device to
connect with the app name.


160
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,596
All right, so the next one
is avoid a lot of text.


161
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:10,306
In fact, if you can get
away with having no text,


162
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,406
that's probably the
right thing to do.


163
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:16,926
So, let's take a made-up
example to illustrate a point.


164
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,606
This is for a fictitious
hair salon and make


165
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:21,886
up studio called Fuzz.


166
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:25,026
Now, you can have
an icon that's--


167
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:28,396
a logo that's this complicated
and it might work really well


168
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:32,186
in website or in marketing
collateral, on a billboard,


169
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:35,576
but when you reduce it
down to use as app icon,


170
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:39,296
it starts to break down
very quickly especially


171
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:42,936
when you start to think
about all the smaller sizes


172
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,116
that people are going see then.


173
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:47,816
So that was a fake example.


174
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,296
Let's take a more real example.


175
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:52,546
A lot of you guys use this app.


176
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:55,106
It's a great app,
ness, you can use it


177
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:56,976
to find restaurant
recommendations


178
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:59,346
and they have very customized
personal profile based


179
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:00,666
on your own preferences.


180
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:05,196
And they have a really fantastic
logo that's actually really


181
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:07,536
simple, not nearly
as complicated


182
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:08,716
as what we just looked
at before.


183
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:13,906
And they could've maybe just
taken that and reduced it


184
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,296
and used it as an app icon.


185
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:17,986
But that wouldn't
have been good enough.


186
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:21,596
What they chose to do
instead was to pull


187
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:24,326
out just the heart and use that.


188
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,906
It's a really simply shape.


189
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:28,736
Now I was going to call this


190
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,896
out when I was talking
multiple colors,


191
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:33,036
and you can see there
are multiple colors here


192
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:36,876
but the composition of the heart
really holds that altogether.


193
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:41,116
So even at small
sizes, it works well.


194
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:44,816
I've had this app on my
phone for a number of months


195
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:49,706
and it always catches my
attention, it really stands out.


196
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:52,996
In fact, you see a lot


197
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,746
of companies doing
this sort of thing.


198
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:59,226
So for example, Pocket, they
have that little pocket icon


199
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:02,916
with the down arrow and they
use that as their app icon,


200
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,016
it works really well,
or Pinterest


201
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:09,956
with their P that's kind of
like an abstract pin or the S


202
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:13,646
for Snapguide and
the V for Vine,


203
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:15,316
there's some patterns here.


204
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:18,266
But the reason why
there's this pattern is


205
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:20,136
because this works really well.


206
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,546
Now, of course, they bring in
the color from their brands


207
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,236
to give it some unique
personality


208
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:32,096
and they work well
on the home screen.


209
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:36,306
Alright, next up,
accurately portray materials.


210
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:41,046
Now this might be a little
bit surprising given some


211
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:43,466
of the changes that
have taken place,


212
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,026
but sometimes materials
are really important


213
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,036
for your app icon.


214
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:51,926
App icon is the ability
to be expressive


215
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:56,986
to demonstrate your unique value
and personality of your app.


216
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,936
So let's look at Paper.


217
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,876
I mean, the name of
the product is Paper.


218
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:05,426
So it would be sort of odd
if your icon didn't look


219
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:06,786
like it was made from paper.


220
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:11,146
Paper is this brilliant
drawing and painting tool


221
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:14,896
which won an ADA last year and
it's got these amazing brushes


222
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:17,776
and you can-- anything you draw
is going to look beautiful.


223
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:21,356
And so, they demonstrate
that by these careful washes,


224
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:25,626
the watercolor layered
on top of layer of color.


225
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:29,166
They have the crease of
the paper which connects


226
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:32,866
to the journals that you
see inside of application.


227
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:34,756
It's a really nice icon.


228
00:12:35,326 --> 00:12:38,536
And this icon, from
Square Wallet,


229
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,406
it's kind of that hologram
thing that you used


230
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:42,346
to see in credit cards.


231
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,886
I don't know if they still have
them but this is beautiful.


232
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,736
And I know it has
a lot of colors


233
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,786
but it has an overall color
of the sort of cool blue tone


234
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,646
and it's got a really
distinct shape,


235
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:58,756
it's got these concentric
squares


236
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,276
so just it pops really well,
it's easy to make this out.


237
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:05,656
If you're going to go
for a texture like this,


238
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:08,826
this holographic paper,
you really want to sell it,


239
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:11,076
you really want to nail it,
and this icon does that.


240
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,426
Now, this icon from 1Password


241
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,956
and 1Password stores
all your passwords,


242
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:20,196
obviously that's pretty
sensitive information


243
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:23,186
so you want to get a sense
that that data is secure,


244
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:27,636
and this icon conveys that
by looking like a lock or--


245
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,616
sorry, a safe, you
know, it feels strong,


246
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:32,746
it feels impenetrable.


247
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:36,686
So, it's communicating
these emotional reactions


248
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,286
or it's eliciting these
emotional reactions in us


249
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:43,626
and we see it and that's why
they use these materials.


250
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,966
But, again, it's
really realistic.


251
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:52,256
And finally, I came across
this icon when I was looking


252
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:53,946
for some examples
to show you guys,


253
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:57,186
and this is for an
app called LifeKraze,


254
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:58,946
it's kind of a cool app.


255
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:02,986
You set some personal goals and
then you have a team of people


256
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,806
who are in your social
network and they cheer you on


257
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:07,346
and in turn, you cheer them on.


258
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:09,906
And I didn't a get a chance
to confirm this with them


259
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:12,586
but my interpretation of this
is that it's meant to be kind


260
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:13,656
of like a team Jersey


261
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:16,746
or sponsorship kind
of thing, embroidery.


262
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:21,116
But look how amazing
this icon is.


263
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,236
I mean, the texture of the
string, the embroidery,


264
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,166
I'm not even sure
how they made this.


265
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:33,276
[laughter] I've been at
this for a really long time.


266
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:36,976
I want to go out there and
figure out their trick.


267
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,576
So this is brilliant.


268
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:43,246
Again, this is highest
level of artistry.


269
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:47,866
And finally, be creative.


270
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,326
I can't emphasize this enough.


271
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,156
You try to stand out from
the crowd, you're trying


272
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,336
to stand out from the rest.


273
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,756
So take for example this icon
for an app called Routesy,


274
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:57,996
it gives you information


275
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:02,226
about local Muni Transit
timetables and such.


276
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:05,146
This looks like the
old Muni Passes.


277
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:09,576
It's really nice,
it looks pretty.


278
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,006
This icon from Hipstamatic.


279
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:15,516
You guys are familiar with this?


280
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:16,836
Or Evernote Food?


281
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:21,456
Or this icon for Brewski Me.


282
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:25,596
I mean, look at the
perspiration on the glass,


283
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:29,096
in a way that frothy
head foam is


284
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,806
about to just fall
over the edge.


285
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:32,106
It's really dynamic.


286
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:34,666
It has a lot of good
characteristics


287
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:36,756
that we look for
in illustration.


288
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:41,136
And yet, while this is a
really complicated rendering,


289
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,596
it's actually kind of simple
and when you pull back from it,


290
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:48,246
you see it's just a big area
of yellow color in the center


291
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:51,046
with a nice white outline,
stands out really well


292
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:52,236
from multiple backgrounds.


293
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:54,806
Anyone thirsty?


294
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:56,536
I became a little thirsty.


295
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,536
So these are really
creative icons.


296
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:05,066
Now, we'd looked at a range
of icons and I'm going


297
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,646
to show you all the way
for a new phone icon.


298
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,706
It couldn't be more simple.


299
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,616
Just a simple shape and a
gradient up to something


300
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:19,856
which is a little bit more
complicated all the way


301
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:22,436
to something which is this
really detailed illustration


302
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:22,886
for Sip.


303
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:26,986
And these are all valid
approaches to designing icons.


304
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:30,956
They work well for their
respective products.


305
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:36,176
Alright, next bit of
advice, please make sure


306
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:39,016
to check your icon against
multiple backgrounds.


307
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:43,526
It's really tempting, a lot
easier, in fact, to just test it


308
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:44,886
against a black background.


309
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:48,286
But a lot of times, you can't--
you have to account for the fact


310
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:51,066
that these icons are going to
show up against who knows what.


311
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:56,556
And also, put your icons into
a group and then collapse


312
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:59,406
that group and evaluate
how well it's working.


313
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:06,086
So, I'm going to show you
really a cool case study.


314
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,266
This is for an app
called Turnplay


315
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:13,356
and the design work was done
by a company called Ramotion


316
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,576
and what Turnplay is, is this
fun little app that allows you


317
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:20,445
to play your MP3 files,
whatever your music files


318
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:21,925
as though they were vinyl,


319
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:26,195
and that's the whole
sum of this app.


320
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,296
That's what it does and
that what makes it unique


321
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:29,096
and special.


322
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,876
So even when you
select your songs,


323
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,616
they have the sleeves
for the vinyl.


324
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,696
And then this is the turntable
interface that you see


325
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:38,696
when you're playing a record.


326
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,716
This is not a photo.


327
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:44,346
Every pixel here was hand-drawn


328
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:47,006
in Illustrator then
in Photoshop.


329
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:50,626
I mean, this is an exquisite
rendering of a turntable.


330
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:55,626
So when it came time for
them to make an app icon,


331
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,786
they knew they needed to connect
to those characteristics.


332
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,306
They knew they needed to
demonstrate the beauty


333
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,426
of that turntable
interface but they also had


334
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:05,136
to get the symbolism
of the icon right,


335
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:09,176
and so Ramotion started
with sketches.


336
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:11,756
Now, there's a lot of different
approaches to making icons.


337
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:15,246
You could start in a 3D
rendering tool, you can start


338
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:17,476
in Photoshop, you can
do whiteboard drawings.


339
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,526
In fact, that's-- my team
used to do a lot of it


340
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:23,566
when we started app
icons for Apple products.


341
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:27,276
But they started with paper
sketches and the team set


342
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:29,006
out to work out all
these different ideas.


343
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:30,526
And as you could see,


344
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,226
they explored a lot
of different things.


345
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:36,916
All these of icons have a
vinyl record at the heart of it


346
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,336
but then they tried
different compositions,


347
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:43,356
adding different elements,
you can see the hands here,


348
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:47,456
the styluses, different
orientations,


349
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:50,496
a lot of them are top-down but
this one second from the right,


350
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,416
is at a 45-degree angle,


351
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,846
and sometimes the record is
floating above the platter.


352
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,956
Sometimes, there's a-- the hint
of an audience in the background


353
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,076
or the dot pattern
from the platter


354
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:02,466
to tell you what tempo you're
playing your record at.


355
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:05,106
It's really antiquated
technology.


356
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:09,356
How many people have
heard of a turntable?


357
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,266
So, they tried all
these different things.


358
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:15,016
They even tried to do what
we were looking at before,


359
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:18,236
which is to take the first
letter of their app name, the T,


360
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:21,176
and integrate that into
the design, and they came


361
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:25,086
up with some pretty interesting
ideas on how to accomplish that.


362
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:29,186
By starting with sketches,
you're not thinking about color,


363
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,826
you're not thinking about
materials, you're thinking


364
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:34,536
about the core element
of the illustration


365
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:36,146
which is the composition.


366
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,456
It's really important that
your composition is solid.


367
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:43,456
So they kept going, tried out--


368
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:45,896
I don't know what the
fingerprints thing is.


369
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,306
I know you get fingerprints
on vinyl.


370
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:52,046
I'm glad they didn't
go down that route.


371
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:54,356
And finally, they started to
kind of lock in what they wanted


372
00:19:54,356 --> 00:20:01,256
to do and eventually,
they got to this.


373
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:03,316
Really simple, right?


374
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:10,826
Turntable, play, and you can
see they started to think, "Oh,


375
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,556
we're going to have this play
icon in here" but it's going


376
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:16,586
to be like this little sticky
label that goes on the record.


377
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:20,126
But these are concentric shapes.


378
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,356
They're really powerful.


379
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:25,036
This is a strong form
in and of itself.


380
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:31,146
Only from-- only when they
had that did they to start add


381
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,266
in some of the detail.


382
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,186
They started to add
in gradients.


383
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,736
They added in the dot
pattern around the platter


384
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,786
but they didn't make
it totally accurate


385
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:39,616
because that would
have been a mess.


386
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:41,646
I mean, it just would have
been too much detail to work


387
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:44,306
at any size, even 1024 square.


388
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:49,746
They kept adding in a
detail, adding in detail.


389
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:55,066
They gave that play icon that
papery texture so really knew


390
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:56,206
that it was supposed
to be paper.


391
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,026
Shading, highlight.


392
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:02,766
With each successive
version, it really started


393
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,196
to come together more and more.


394
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,676
But never losing sight
of that basic shape


395
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:16,786
that they had started with,
and it works well at all sizes


396
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,486
because they stuck to that,
they stuck to that basic shape.


397
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:25,936
Alright, so that was a
lot of stuff on icons


398
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,976
but it's probably the most
important thing to get right


399
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:30,326
when it comes to visual design.


400
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:32,906
Let's move on.


401
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:38,116
This is Forced Registration,
and for the example,


402
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:40,126
this actually was
shown last year.


403
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:44,776
But a lot of apps do
this kind of thing


404
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:46,356
where they give you two options.


405
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:49,486
You open the app and they
ask you to sign up or sign in


406
00:21:49,486 --> 00:21:53,816
and a lot of people hit the Home
button and delete the app icon.


407
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:59,356
People hate this which is
why it's mind-boggling to me


408
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,486
that it still happens,
but it still does.


409
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:03,576
So let's look at a case study.


410
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,826
This was an app called Fondu.


411
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,176
They used to be in App
Store, they're not anymore,


412
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:12,416
they've been acquired by Airbnb.


413
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:13,906
So all the stuff
I'm going to show


414
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:16,316
that they did obviously was
very successful for them,


415
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:19,056
but they used to
make you sign up.


416
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:22,076
It's a social networking
food app.


417
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:27,356
And they realized that
weren't getting the uptake


418
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,416
in people signing
up and registering


419
00:22:30,646 --> 00:22:32,286
because they would
just do what I said,


420
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:33,936
they would leave right away.


421
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:35,446
They didn't know the
value of the app.


422
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:39,476
So instead, they completely went
away and redesigned their app


423
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,136
to show a few screens
right off the bat,


424
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:45,306
where you can see
something about the features


425
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:47,686
and understand what
purpose this product serves,


426
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:53,146
and only when you got to the end
of it where you given the choice


427
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:54,906
to sign up or to sign in.


428
00:22:55,816 --> 00:23:01,026
But even with that, they
allowed a third choice which was


429
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,636
to continue forward
and get a taste--


430
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:05,626
this is a nice little
bit of copy--


431
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:09,806
and you can use public
features of the app,


432
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:12,136
and so you really
would get a sense


433
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:15,596
for why this app had value,
what was interesting about it.


434
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:19,556
And I recommend that if
you're in a similar situation,


435
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:20,686
you should do the same thing.


436
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,786
You want to allow people
to try before they buy.


437
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:30,786
As a result, they had
a 42 percent increase


438
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,996
in registration shortly after
they made these design changes.


439
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:36,246
As we talked about, they
eventually got acquired,


440
00:23:36,536 --> 00:23:38,916
so do what they did
and allow people


441
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,796
to use your product
rather than forcing them


442
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:41,976
to registrater right
off the bat.


443
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:46,146
All right, so that was
forced registration.


444
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,886
The next pitfall
is Tiny Controls.


445
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:54,096
Now, this is how we could
have designed the WWDC app.


446
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:56,916
We could have made text smaller,


447
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,746
we could have made the rows
smaller, little date switcher


448
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:03,956
at the top, all the buttons
and the nav bar, but instead,


449
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,206
this is what we actually
shipped.


450
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:08,716
Things are-- have
normal metrics,


451
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:10,166
they're a lot easier to tap.


452
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:15,686
If you have greater density
and really small tap targets,


453
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:18,296
it's hard to aim
so that slows you


454
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:20,996
down as you're pointing your
finger towards the screen,


455
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:22,776
it makes you more conscious
of what you're doing.


456
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,976
So while you might see more
stuff on screen at one time,


457
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,916
your app becomes harder to use.


458
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:32,326
It's much easier when you have
really easy to tap targets.


459
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:36,776
You have to design your
products for a fingertip.


460
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,586
I'm surprised when
I see some apps


461
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,406
that have these really
small tap targets and things


462
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:43,406
that are crammed together.


463
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:49,236
It looks like it was designed
for someone who has a cursor.


464
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:53,016
So as you'll see, if you might
read on the HIG, we recommend


465
00:24:53,046 --> 00:24:57,966
that controls are 44 points
tall, and you'll see that over


466
00:24:57,966 --> 00:25:00,726
and over again in the
controls that we have.


467
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:07,726
Now, this number, 44 points,
this goes back, this isn't new


468
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:10,706
to iOS 7 even though I'm showing
an iOS 7 screen right here.


469
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:14,466
The metrics for a lot of our
controls have stayed the same


470
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:18,836
because the size of our
fingers have stayed the same.


471
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:21,786
So you'll see it
over and over again.


472
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:25,896
Nav bar 44 points,
toolbar 44 points.


473
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:30,656
Even the little callout
for the map is 44 points.


474
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:38,266
Now, if you have additional
space like we did for calendar


475
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:41,056
in iOS 6, make your
controls bigger,


476
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:44,866
it just makes them
easier to tap.


477
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:46,846
And we've updated calculator


478
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,996
and now these controls
are bigger still,


479
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:55,366
so they're even easier to tap.


480
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,516
And some apps you use
when you're moving around.


481
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:02,676
This is a Cycling app by Strava,
it allows you track your ride


482
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:06,476
through GPS, and you
want to be able to start


483
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:09,346
and stop this while
you're on your bike


484
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:10,606
and while you're moving.


485
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,986
So this button that
they have for doing


486
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:15,496
that is 120 points in diameter.


487
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:16,706
It's really easy to tap.


488
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:19,856
I wouldn't be surprised actually
if the tap area is bigger


489
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:22,856
than the size of the button.


490
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:25,536
And lastly, when you're
evaluating whether


491
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:30,906
or not a control is large
enough, test it on your device.


492
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,076
There's no substitute for that,


493
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:36,886
you can't make this decision
just sitting at your desk


494
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,036
and tapping the interface
of the phone.


495
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:42,806
Go outside, walk around,
use it as an opportunity


496
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:46,676
to do something healthy, stretch
your legs, get some fresh air,


497
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:51,346
give your eyes a break, maybe
hold a cup of coffee in one hand


498
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:54,336
and try to use your phone, and
see how that works for you.


499
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:56,456
Think it'll be educational.


500
00:26:56,456 --> 00:27:02,626
All right, the next common
pitfall is Hard-to-Read Text.


501
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,996
Now, this is how our WWDC
app could have looked


502
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,976
if we were cruel and insane.


503
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:15,686
[laughter] But why is
text hard to read here?


504
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:19,016
Well, it's hard to read because
the colors are too saturated,


505
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:19,846
they're too bright.


506
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:27,996
The font that I chose, it's not
bad per se, but it doesn't work


507
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:30,026
at a small size,
that script font,


508
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:32,776
it's way too small,
can't make that out.


509
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:37,406
This would have really
stoked the rumor mills


510
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,316
about the new design of iOS 7.


511
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,846
[laughter] We probably
should have done it.


512
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,456
So this is something a little
bit more plausible, right?


513
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,056
I see some stuff more like
this on a common basis


514
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:52,396
and the problem is
just low contrast.


515
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,876
A good metric to use is that
the contrast between text


516
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,516
and background should
be at least 50 percent,


517
00:27:59,426 --> 00:28:03,556
maybe 60 percent in brightness
which is kind of a hard thing


518
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,116
when you're talking about
different colors like red


519
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:08,576
against yellow or something
like that but if you were


520
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:12,296
to desaturate your image and
then measure the colors of gray,


521
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:15,966
that's the kind of delta you
want between the color values.


522
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:20,126
So this is the actual
design for the WWDC app


523
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:23,736
and you can see here the
text is basically black


524
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,726
and the background is
almost totally white.


525
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:29,776
So it's really easy to
read and, of course,


526
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:32,236
the fonts are a nice,
legible size.


527
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:39,546
On Wednesday, I talked about
this screen in the context


528
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:45,356
of type and I want to bring it
up again because for one thing,


529
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:49,456
while there's a lot of different
sizes of type and weights


530
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:52,936
of type, which is really
important for establishing,


531
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:54,946
communicating information
hierarchy,


532
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,536
calling out which things are
more important than others,


533
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,666
it's all the same typeface.


534
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:06,226
And that adds to a sense of
coherency, it all fits together.


535
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:08,296
We didn't just throw
a script font in here.


536
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,966
Now, I really recommend
that you do the same thing.


537
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,066
You can mix and match typefaces,


538
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,606
that's actually an extremely
difficult thing to do.


539
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:18,556
I don't do it 'cause
I don't think--


540
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,296
I usually don't think
it's very successful.


541
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:22,596
I don't know how to
pull it off very well.


542
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:28,496
So we have all these different
styles of type and again,


543
00:29:28,496 --> 00:29:31,896
another plug for dynamic
type 'cause that's how all


544
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:32,696
of this was made.


545
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:34,426
This is really good way to go.


546
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,496
If you use this, you're
going to have great results.


547
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:42,126
Now, the other thing
is we have large blocks


548
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,946
of text they have mailed
from both the 6 and 7 here.


549
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:48,396
And previously, we would
recommend as a baseline


550
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:52,186
that your fonts are 15 points or
higher if you have large blocks


551
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:56,496
of text that people are going
to need to read for a while.


552
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:57,906
Now, that's changed a bit.


553
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,166
We can't just say
make it 15 points.


554
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,026
Now, with dynamic type,
it's all scalable.


555
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:06,306
So these really mean,
what size of body text?


556
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:09,106
But this is the default
size which is large


557
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:11,946
and as you can see,
the font size is larger


558
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:14,806
than what we have before,
and that's something


559
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,486
that we talked a lot
about on Wednesday


560
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:18,626
which is the importance
of legibility


561
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:21,926
and I think even what we were
doing before, our minimum size


562
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,026
for fonts, for body
fonts, was too small


563
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:27,256
and the decision was made
to up it just because it's


564
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:28,866
so much easier to read.


565
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,156
Now, another important
thing about text is


566
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:33,976
that you want to have alignment.


567
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,256
Alignment provides structure.


568
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:41,926
It's the key to making an app
UI feel aesthetically balanced


569
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:44,426
and organized, easy to look at.


570
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:48,156
But beyond that, it makes
it easy to scan text


571
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:49,506
and find what you're
looking for.


572
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:54,066
This UI is static now but a lot
of times, when you're looking


573
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:56,676
at this, you're swiping it
quickly and you're scanning


574
00:30:56,676 --> 00:30:58,746
for text, you're trying
to make out, you know,


575
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:04,266
I'm looking for text from Paul
Brennen or Michelle Humphrey


576
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:07,156
and you have to be able to
see that even as it's moving.


577
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:08,686
Alignment is the key to that.


578
00:31:10,116 --> 00:31:12,416
And another important
about text, again,


579
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:14,486
you'll see a left
alignment, it's very clear,


580
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:19,516
just like before, is
breaking up your content.


581
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:22,636
Don't just slam stuff
together because you want


582
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:25,276
to cram more stuff on the
screen, onto the screen.


583
00:31:25,556 --> 00:31:27,856
You need to break up the
text the people are seeing.


584
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:33,546
It helps you to see connections
between disparate lines of text.


585
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:35,836
So these phone numbers
are grouped together,


586
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:38,456
so I understand that whole
areas about phone numbers


587
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:42,006
which is separate from FaceTime,
separate from sending a message


588
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:44,026
or looking up someone's
address on the map.


589
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,296
Negative space is
the key to that.


590
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:51,106
Use it well, use it liberally
and if it's not enough,


591
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:57,166
use separator lines to even-to
draw even clearer separations


592
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,286
between different
lines of texts.


593
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:04,166
And again, test on a device.


594
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:07,086
The reason why I'm
bringing it up now is


595
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:10,076
because when I'm talking
about contrast, when you look


596
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:12,766
at something indoors, it's
really easy to see all


597
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,706
of the nuances of the
different shades of color.


598
00:32:15,176 --> 00:32:17,966
When you walk outside,
things are very different,


599
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:22,046
colors just compress into each
other, becomes hard to tell


600
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:22,866
that there's differences.


601
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:25,576
So you really want to make
sure that you're evaluating


602
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,666
if you have sufficient contrast
by walking outside and not


603
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:31,566
at night but at 2:00
in the afternoon,


604
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:34,266
when it's really
bright and sunny.


605
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:39,466
And also, there's a lot of great
tools available for helping


606
00:32:39,516 --> 00:32:42,266
to look at UI and
analyze things.


607
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:45,326
LiveView is one of the
oldest, it allows you


608
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:48,666
to just take a design
and send it to a device.


609
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:51,196
Skala View is a great tool.


610
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:54,976
xScope Mirror has a lot
of pixel levels instrument


611
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,286
measuring stuff.


612
00:32:57,306 --> 00:32:59,046
Screenshots Journal
also awesome.


613
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,916
All right, next Ambiguous
Alerts.


614
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:10,536
So we've all seen things
like this, maybe we had it


615
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:13,816
in an earlier version of our
app just for kind of debugging


616
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:16,206
and testing and sometimes
this app makes it


617
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:20,216
through to the final app and
this isn't helpful at all.


618
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:21,956
You have no idea
what's going on.


619
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:23,856
This isn't a real one.


620
00:33:24,226 --> 00:33:29,526
I've changed the names
to protect the innocent.


621
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:33,056
This is a classic, again,


622
00:33:33,736 --> 00:33:37,366
this is real alert
that's-- has existed.


623
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:39,386
What are you suppose to do here?


624
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:46,556
[laughter] Catch-22.


625
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:49,736
So be conscious of that.


626
00:33:50,056 --> 00:33:53,616
This also, obviously it's
funny because, you know, well,


627
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:54,526
you guys all got the joke,


628
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:57,316
but this also demonstrates
something really important


629
00:33:57,316 --> 00:33:59,246
which is that OK,
it's on the left


630
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:00,876
and you never want to do that.


631
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,106
You always want the affirmative,


632
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:05,066
the forward moving
action to be on the right.


633
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:10,666
Now, the best alert is no alert.


634
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:15,585
Alerts are really meant to call
your attention to something,


635
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:17,346
you know, something that
needs your attention


636
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,906
and it makes you aware
of that by popping


637
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:20,255
up this whole thing
in front of you.


638
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:22,556
But oftentimes, that's
unnecessary.


639
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:26,545
So if we showed an alert
every time mail was able


640
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:28,476
to successfully update
its contents,


641
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:31,045
that will get pretty
annoying pretty quick.


642
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,056
So we just have some
status text that tells you


643
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:35,226
when it was last updated.


644
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:37,846
Try to do that.


645
00:34:37,846 --> 00:34:42,286
Try to integrate information
that's updating and changing


646
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:46,686
into your app UI if you can.


647
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:48,295
This is from iOS 6.


648
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,146
This is a really valid point.


649
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:54,146
When you bring up an
alert, label your buttons


650
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:58,016
with the action that
they're going to perform.


651
00:34:58,116 --> 00:35:00,706
People are using your
device-- people are--


652
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:04,236
we're all using these
devices and we're distracted


653
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,376
and we get a phone call, we
might not be paying a whole lot


654
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:08,216
of attention, we might
of skim the question


655
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:10,646
or the message that's
in the alert but we have


656
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,276
to press the button and that
usually focuses our attention a


657
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:14,016
little bit more.


658
00:35:14,316 --> 00:35:17,326
So if we read some text
about the resulting actions,


659
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,626
then it's going to be
a little bit safer,


660
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:21,616
it's more of a guarantee
that people are going


661
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:22,746
to make the right choice.


662
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:26,876
And while we're talking
about that, we should avoid


663
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:30,296
if at all possible, simple
button labels like Yes


664
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:33,066
and No or OK and Cancel.


665
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:35,376
If you can get more
specific, please do that.


666
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:37,246
It's really helpful
for your users.


667
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:40,916
Now, if you've been paying
really close attention on iOS 7,


668
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:41,756
you've actually noticed


669
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:44,156
that that this particular
alert has changed.


670
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:47,856
We added the option to
snooze when you get an alert.


671
00:35:48,786 --> 00:35:51,156
And rather than cramming
too many choices,


672
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:54,156
rather than presenting the user


673
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:55,946
with too many choices
right off the bat,


674
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:59,336
you're given two many
options, just say OK,


675
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:03,386
or to look at what options
are available to you and then


676
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:06,716
and only then do we show
Snooze and to View Event.


677
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:08,766
But again, you can see these
labels are very specific


678
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,706
about what actions
they'll perform.


679
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:17,716
All right, and I already
talked this a little bit


680
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:21,586
but put the affirmative
action on the right.


681
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:25,966
Now, there's a bit of a
disagreement between Apple


682
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:28,586
and Microsoft about what the
right approach is to do here,


683
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:33,036
and in fact, sometimes I chuckle
when I go to an ATM or I look


684
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:36,786
at a website that has this
kind of buttons and I see OK is


685
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:38,826
on the left or Yes
is on the left.


686
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:40,256
I know that the designer


687
00:36:40,256 --> 00:36:43,306
who made it is using
a Windows machine.


688
00:36:43,796 --> 00:36:44,726
That's what they're used to.


689
00:36:45,616 --> 00:36:46,546
Now you will too.


690
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:52,106
And I don't know if we're ever
going to see eye to eye on this.


691
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:54,476
I hope that Microsoft will
come around and see the error


692
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:57,946
of their ways but it's
been a couple of decades


693
00:36:57,946 --> 00:36:59,926
so I'm not going
to hold my breath.


694
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,836
So in the meantime, just
recognize that the people


695
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:06,896
who are using your
apps on iOS are used


696
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,376
to a particular button order.


697
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:11,046
They're used to the affirmative
actions being on the right,


698
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:13,296
the forward moving
action being on the right.


699
00:37:13,826 --> 00:37:18,706
And then finally, sometimes an
alert is not the right thing


700
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:22,046
if someone's about to perform
a potentially destructive


701
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,846
or harmful action.


702
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:27,336
If you delete this
photo, it's gone for good.


703
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:31,256
So it's really important
that users are aware


704
00:37:31,256 --> 00:37:32,746
of the consequence
of their actions.


705
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:38,456
So use an action sheet
in cases like this.


706
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:40,286
And be sensitive to the order


707
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:41,826
that you're putting
these buttons in.


708
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:45,406
The most harmful, the riskiest
action should be at the top,


709
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:48,476
it should be the furthest away
from where your thumb is if it's


710
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:51,856
at the bottom of the device,
and it should also colored red


711
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:54,696
to give you that
reminder, that warning


712
00:37:54,836 --> 00:37:56,436
that there might be
something harmful.


713
00:37:58,206 --> 00:38:01,726
OK, next up, Out-Of-Place
terminology.


714
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:05,826
Now, a big part of making
apps, really easy to use,


715
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,846
really intuitive for a
broad range of users is


716
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:11,946
to not use jargon, not
use technical terms.


717
00:38:13,136 --> 00:38:14,686
And it's hard for us to remember


718
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:17,436
that because we're still
comfortable with that language.


719
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,476
We use it all the time and
sometimes these terms are--


720
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:21,916
allow us to speak
with precision,


721
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:25,026
clarity amongst ourselves.


722
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:28,836
Not amongst the general
population.


723
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:31,926
So we could have called
Airplane Mode Cellular Baseband


724
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,956
but no one would
know what that meant.


725
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:39,056
Equally, we could have said
Add New GPS Indicator to Map,


726
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:41,156
but instead, we just
said Drop a Pin,


727
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:43,686
so much simpler, makes sense.


728
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:45,406
There we are.


729
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,566
Everyone wave.


730
00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:52,956
And if at all possible,
avoid referring to the files.


731
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:57,806
iOS tries to obfuscate
the underlying file system


732
00:38:57,806 --> 00:38:58,766
as much as possible.


733
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:02,936
So in Numbers, they don't
talk about untitled.numbers


734
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:05,956
or Create a New File, it's
Make a New Spreadsheet.


735
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:11,456
Next up, avoid Excessive
Branding.


736
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,826
I see this all the time.


737
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:15,486
I really do.


738
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,966
And if you show me your app
and it has a logo in it,


739
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:21,786
you're hear an earful about
why I think that's a bad I idea


740
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:24,536
because it's usually, the
logo is usually placed


741
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:26,376
in the nav bar, right
at the top,


742
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:28,466
right where the title should be.


743
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,966
So, again, WWDC app.


744
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,826
We could have put
the logo up there


745
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:35,496
but we don't want to do that.


746
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:39,776
It's a terrible idea
because that space is needed


747
00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:42,696
for showing a title to tell
you what you're looking at,


748
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:43,926
tell you where you are.


749
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:49,656
My advice when people say, "Hey,


750
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:51,146
you know what we
put the logo there


751
00:39:51,146 --> 00:39:53,996
because we think it's important
for building brand recognition."


752
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,916
I said, "That's the
wrong approach in iOS."


753
00:39:57,746 --> 00:40:00,166
Sometimes you see a logo
showing up and you get the sense


754
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:01,036
that people are thinking


755
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:03,086
about their app is
though it was a website.


756
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:06,126
And with a website, showing
your logo actually serves a


757
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:08,806
functional purpose,
utilitarian purpose.


758
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:11,346
People can come to your
website from any other place,


759
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:14,746
though a link or wherever and it
helps them stay oriented to know


760
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,676
that they've gone from one place
to another, know where they are.


761
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:21,176
But that's not the case in iOS.


762
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:24,176
In iOS, someone presses your
app icon on the home screen,


763
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:27,046
they saw your logo
probably at that juncture


764
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:29,396
and the whole experiences
of your brand.


765
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:32,956
And if you're now showing
them a logo in place


766
00:40:32,956 --> 00:40:34,796
of showing them some
information which is going to--


767
00:40:35,496 --> 00:40:37,466
the title, which is going
to help them stay oriented


768
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:38,546
and know what they're
looking at,


769
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:41,876
then you're degrading their
user experience so they're going


770
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:45,446
to have a less positive
experience of your brand.


771
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:51,046
All right, enough about logos.


772
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,916
Uninformative back buttons.


773
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:58,486
If at all possible, please
label your back buttons


774
00:40:58,486 --> 00:40:59,526
with something informative.


775
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,066
We don't do this.


776
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:06,256
We're in Settings and this
back button just says Back.


777
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:08,836
The error tells me
it's a back button.


778
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,156
I don't need text to tell
me I'm going to go back.


779
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:13,746
Now, I see a lot
of this and a lot


780
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:15,146
of times the explanation
is that, well,


781
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:18,366
we don't have enough
space to display the title


782
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:22,886
of the parent view, but
look at changing the title


783
00:41:22,886 --> 00:41:25,956
of the parent view or the
child view to make that space


784
00:41:26,246 --> 00:41:28,646
because it's a really
important way to allow people


785
00:41:28,896 --> 00:41:31,226
to have context, to
know where they are.


786
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:37,986
All right, there's a connection
between the back button


787
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:39,916
and the title of
the previous view.


788
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:46,176
And what's more to iOS 7, we
have this really nifty animation


789
00:41:46,516 --> 00:41:48,456
that makes that connection
very clear.


790
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:50,606
So if your back button
said Back,


791
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,246
this wouldn't work very well.


792
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:58,896
So, for example, if we just
said Back here, we wouldn't know


793
00:41:58,896 --> 00:41:59,906
where we're going to back to.


794
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:05,386
We're looking at the info for an
event but where would I go back


795
00:42:05,496 --> 00:42:06,936
to if I press that button?


796
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:10,596
Now, in actuality, what
we have is sets of events.


797
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:13,286
I'm just going to point
this out a little bit


798
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:15,456
because there's actually no
title in that parent view.


799
00:42:15,906 --> 00:42:18,766
It's a segmented control
for filtering favorites


800
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:21,646
or just showing every event
for the schedule this week.


801
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:26,036
But it does connect to
the tab, the Events tab,


802
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:27,466
so it still makes sense.


803
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:31,556
All right, that was
the Back button.


804
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,346
Onto the second to
last common pitfall


805
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:36,636
which is Confusing Animations.


806
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,486
Now I see this all the time.


807
00:42:40,006 --> 00:42:44,656
This is Stocks, and when you
bring up the settings UI,


808
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:47,466
it animates up, slides up.


809
00:42:48,306 --> 00:42:50,906
And when you dismiss
it, slides down.


810
00:42:51,496 --> 00:42:55,136
It's really basic,
really straightforward.


811
00:42:55,136 --> 00:42:55,886
It's symmetrical.


812
00:42:55,936 --> 00:42:56,986
It makes sense.


813
00:42:56,986 --> 00:43:00,286
So now, when it comes again,
we're going to figure it's going


814
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,696
to come up from the
bottom because that


815
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,636
where it seems to have gone to.


816
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:06,486
It's persistence.


817
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:10,046
We imagine it'll still be
there down at the bottom.


818
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:16,016
Sometimes, things will slide
up and then they keep on going.


819
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:19,326
Where did they go?


820
00:43:20,466 --> 00:43:23,146
Apparently, they're going to
fly all the way around the world


821
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:24,836
and come back to the bottom


822
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,926
so that they're there
the next time.


823
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:32,526
Sometimes, you slide up the
Settings and you dismiss it


824
00:43:32,706 --> 00:43:33,686
and it just disappears.


825
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:35,746
That doesn't feel right.


826
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:39,816
It feels like they just forgot
to do the animation to go away.


827
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:45,926
Sometimes, bring up Settings


828
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:48,666
and you get something
totally different.


829
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:53,646
This is-- I picked this one
because Keynote let me do it.


830
00:43:55,226 --> 00:43:58,056
And an iris wipe, that
might have made sense


831
00:43:58,126 --> 00:44:00,946
but it should have come
on in the same way.


832
00:44:01,496 --> 00:44:03,336
OK, it would have been a
really bad idea no matter


833
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:05,096
but you guys get point.


834
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:11,336
And then sometimes, you just
get gratuitous animation.


835
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:16,146
It's distracting.


836
00:44:16,596 --> 00:44:17,486
It's unnecessary.


837
00:44:18,816 --> 00:44:20,176
All right, enough
about animation.


838
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:24,096
So I'm going to end on
Inappropriate Styling.


839
00:44:24,686 --> 00:44:27,576
Now, there's a lot of apps


840
00:44:27,576 --> 00:44:30,326
that have a very distinct
visual style for them.


841
00:44:30,856 --> 00:44:35,216
They might have some real world
materials like wood or fabric


842
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:41,696
and maybe you're making an app
that's for high school students


843
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:43,426
who are learning
about woodworking,


844
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:44,586
learning about carpentry.


845
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:50,566
So maybe the appropriate
background is a wood,


846
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:54,866
kind of cartoonish texture,
it makes total sense.


847
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:56,506
It'd be appropriate.


848
00:44:57,396 --> 00:44:59,666
But the key to understanding how


849
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:02,296
to stylize your app
appropriately starts


850
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:04,496
with understanding
your intention.


851
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:08,136
So in everything I just said
right now, I had a picture


852
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:09,576
of who the app was for.


853
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:13,096
I limited it down to
particular age group


854
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:17,646
who had a particular set of
interests, and I picked a style


855
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,246
that was relevant to them.


856
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,256
That made sense.


857
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:21,346
It was a logical fit.


858
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:25,796
So let's look at some examples,
I think, of appropriate styling.


859
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:31,896
This is the UI for ProCreate,
one of the ADA winners.


860
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:34,496
I feel like I'm shilling
for ADA winners.


861
00:45:35,286 --> 00:45:37,086
This is an appropriately
styled app.


862
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,006
It's a wonderful app.


863
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:44,226
Now every aspect, every decision
that they made around the design


864
00:45:44,226 --> 00:45:48,136
of their UI was done so for
a very specific purpose.


865
00:45:48,636 --> 00:45:52,396
This is a real tool
for real artists


866
00:45:52,606 --> 00:45:54,856
and real illustrators
to do real work.


867
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:59,436
And that user base, they have
some very specific needs.


868
00:46:00,606 --> 00:46:03,706
You want to make sure that
your UI doesn't distract


869
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:07,716
from your ability to see all of
the great details in the drawing


870
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:11,446
that you're making, so it's
dark, doesn't interfere


871
00:46:11,446 --> 00:46:13,576
with that, doesn't jump
out in front of it.


872
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:16,416
And I talked about that
on Wednesday, deference.


873
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:20,166
This, I think, displays that
characteristic, it's deferential


874
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:21,166
to the user's content.


875
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:25,516
And it's got a texture to
it but the texture is matte.


876
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:28,086
If they went with
something glossy,


877
00:46:28,446 --> 00:46:31,476
then they would have these
horizon lines in the reflections


878
00:46:31,476 --> 00:46:34,176
and it would add to the
noisiness of the UI.


879
00:46:35,256 --> 00:46:36,716
So it's appropriately styled.


880
00:46:36,716 --> 00:46:39,346
Let's look at another example.


881
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:41,916
WWF Together.


882
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:47,086
Beautiful app and the theme of
the app is based on origami.


883
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:51,666
You'd make these origami animals
and then you can share those


884
00:46:51,906 --> 00:46:54,516
with your friends on
Facebook or email or Twitter.


885
00:46:55,316 --> 00:46:58,446
And they took that feature,
they took that concept


886
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:01,526
and they applied it and
used it as the style


887
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:02,636
of everything in the UI.


888
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:07,576
So this menu system, it
unfolds like pieces of paper,


889
00:47:08,336 --> 00:47:11,356
and the background, it's a
little bit hard to see here


890
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:13,656
but it's got this
triangle shapes different--


891
00:47:13,856 --> 00:47:17,776
subtly different variations of
light gray to really reinforce


892
00:47:17,776 --> 00:47:20,436
that idea that this
is unfolded origami.


893
00:47:21,646 --> 00:47:22,836
And it totally works.


894
00:47:23,046 --> 00:47:25,336
This is an appropriate style
and it's totally unique.


895
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:27,246
It made sense, it's original.


896
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:29,966
Really original.


897
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:36,216
So imagine, if WWF Together
looked like ProCreate,


898
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:39,866
it was dark serious app.


899
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:45,786
Would that work for the purpose
of WWF Together or visa versa?


900
00:47:46,386 --> 00:47:49,656
You would want ProCreate
to have this bright white


901
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:51,406
origami interface.


902
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:53,096
It'd be really distracting.


903
00:47:54,696 --> 00:47:58,006
So let's look at a specific
example of something


904
00:47:58,006 --> 00:47:59,816
which would be an
inappropriate style.


905
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:03,686
So this is photos from iOS 6.


906
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:06,116
If it had a wood background.


907
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:10,236
Now, at first blush, this
might look really pretty.


908
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:12,036
I think it's a nice texture,


909
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:13,616
I mean there's nothing
wrong with that texture.


910
00:48:13,946 --> 00:48:14,526
It looks awesome.


911
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:19,506
But it competes with
the photos themselves.


912
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,476
It interferes with your ability


913
00:48:21,856 --> 00:48:25,826
to see clearly the content
that you care about.


914
00:48:26,426 --> 00:48:28,046
It's not deferential.


915
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:34,496
So the real UI for iPhoto on iOS
6 or for Photos on iOS 6, sorry,


916
00:48:35,186 --> 00:48:36,676
just has a plain
black background.


917
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:42,336
That's not really a theme
per se but it makes it easy


918
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,356
to see the photos and that's
what's really important.


919
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:50,426
So, again, you have to
think about your intent.


920
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:54,656
Now, that's generally good
advice for anything you do


921
00:48:55,406 --> 00:48:57,586
and especially with
design of your product,


922
00:48:58,826 --> 00:49:00,806
but that's just the first step.


923
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:06,466
So, the designers of ProCreate,
they probably started saying,


924
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:07,946
"OK, who's our app for?"


925
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:09,026
It's for artists.


926
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:10,536
"But what do they need?"


927
00:49:10,756 --> 00:49:13,286
They needed a UI which
is functional, efficient,


928
00:49:13,776 --> 00:49:16,236
gives them quick access
to tools, doesn't distract


929
00:49:16,236 --> 00:49:17,726
from the content that
they're creating.


930
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:20,776
Well, what works for that?


931
00:49:20,966 --> 00:49:21,726
Dark palette.


932
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,496
Let's look at some similar
apps, what did they do?


933
00:49:24,496 --> 00:49:26,616
What are the characteristics
of those apps?


934
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:30,586
So there's a progression of
considerations that you have


935
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:37,036
to go through but nowhere
in there is an allowance


936
00:49:37,336 --> 00:49:42,106
for saying, "I just
like wood textures.


937
00:49:42,456 --> 00:49:43,406
I think it looks pretty."


938
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:47,766
You have to avoid doing that
and think about something


939
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:49,546
which is appropriate
for your users.


940
00:49:50,566 --> 00:49:52,216
It makes sense for
them and your product.


941
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:56,256
So those are the 10 common
pitfalls that I see all


942
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:58,236
of the time in iOS apps.


943
00:49:59,146 --> 00:50:00,786
If you can avoid doing
these things, you're going


944
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:01,826
to be in really good shape.


945
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:07,556
So, I'm just going to
give a plug for the HIG.


946
00:50:08,146 --> 00:50:10,976
I'm just really scratching the
surface with these 10 pitfalls.


947
00:50:11,616 --> 00:50:14,436
There is wealth of
fantastic information here


948
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:19,116
which you can use to reference
and learn all about how


949
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:22,976
to use controls and what rules
to follow, what things to avoid.


950
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:26,716
I really urge you to read it, it
can be kind of dense at times.


951
00:50:27,766 --> 00:50:30,006
I know it's not the most
approachable document


952
00:50:30,006 --> 00:50:33,796
in the world and we're working
on that, but it's fantastic.


953
00:50:34,276 --> 00:50:35,796
I've been designing
for many years.


954
00:50:36,006 --> 00:50:38,586
I worked with people who
are equally experienced


955
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:41,036
and we're always
referencing this document,


956
00:50:41,366 --> 00:50:43,746
we're always pointing each
other in the direction


957
00:50:43,746 --> 00:50:47,056
of some particular passage which
gives us guidance about how


958
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:48,896
to do our job correctly.


959
00:50:49,476 --> 00:50:52,086
I have some final thoughts.


960
00:50:53,336 --> 00:50:57,136
Actually, I just have one
final thought, which is focus.


961
00:50:58,696 --> 00:51:04,146
Now, when we were designing
the WWDC app, we could have put


962
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:07,486
in all sorts of great
features, or all sorts


963
00:51:07,486 --> 00:51:11,486
of additional features like
the ability for you developers


964
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:13,016
to network with each other


965
00:51:13,356 --> 00:51:15,336
or to check the current
weather conditions


966
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:18,696
or provide a guide for,
you know, restaurants,


967
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:20,706
clubs or whatever
in San Francisco,


968
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:24,716
but we didn't do those things
because it would've detracted


969
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:28,146
from our core focus
which was to add videos


970
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:30,226
and to integrate Passbook.


971
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:34,856
And we have a team of some
pretty capable engineers


972
00:51:34,856 --> 00:51:38,976
and designers who
are working on this,


973
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:42,226
but despite that,
this is hard work.


974
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:46,296
And in order to make those
features really work great


975
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:49,216
on the app, we had
to concentrate on it


976
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:52,256
and not get distracted by
doing all these things.


977
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,576
And that's my advice to you.


978
00:51:55,306 --> 00:51:57,176
It's to not bite off
more than you can chew.


979
00:51:57,996 --> 00:52:01,236
Figure out what your app can be
really great at and it's going


980
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:05,876
to just be one thing or two
things, and then devote all


981
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:09,196
of your energy to making
sure that that's rock solid,


982
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:10,866
that that's a better feature


983
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,706
than anyone else
in your category.


984
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:14,746
It's hard work.


985
00:52:14,746 --> 00:52:18,006
Some of the things
we looked at up here,


986
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:19,566
they're not easy to achieve.


987
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:22,196
In fact, a lot of
times, it's important


988
00:52:22,196 --> 00:52:24,476
to recognize the limit
of your capabilities.


989
00:52:25,246 --> 00:52:27,776
Hire a designer to
do your app icon.


990
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:30,346
Hire a designer to do
your app interface.


991
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:34,756
This is complex stuff to really
get right, but if you want


992
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:36,936
to stand out on App
Store, if you want your app


993
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:41,116
to be really successful,
that's what it takes.


994
00:52:41,276 --> 00:52:44,466
So, again, focus on
what you can do well


995
00:52:44,526 --> 00:52:46,666
and knock it out
of the ballpark.


996
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,006
That's all I've got.


997
00:52:49,396 --> 00:52:50,496
Thank you very much.


998
00:52:50,996 --> 00:53:05,640
