>> Good morning, and welcome to


4
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:27,826
What's New in Managing Apple

00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:28,336
Devices.


6
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,646
I'm Todd Fernandez, and I'm very


7
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:31,706
pleased to be here with all of


8
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:32,625
you here in the hall this


9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,906
morning, as well as those of you


10
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:35,506
watching this video now or in


11
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:36,086
the future.


12
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:39,036
I'd like to cover all the things


13
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:40,336
that have changed in the past


14
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:42,036
year, since we last did this at


15
00:00:42,036 --> 00:00:43,796
WWDC 2017.


16
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:46,326
But, before we dive into all of


17
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:47,996
those details, I want to take a


18
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,846
moment to take stock of how far


19
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:52,246
we've come.


20
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:53,926
This year, we are very proud to


21
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:55,656
celebrate 40 years of Apple in


22
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,356
education.


23
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,576
And, it's fascinating to see how


24
00:00:58,576 --> 00:00:59,516
much has changed.


25
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:01,906
From the audacious goal of an


26
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:04,956
Apple 2 in every school in 1978,


27
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:08,396
to an iPad or MacBook in every


28
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:10,546
student's hands in 2018.


29
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,006
But, it's even more important to


30
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,276
consider how much has remained


31
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:15,916
the same over those tumultuous


32
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,626
40 years.


33
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:20,336
Apple had a unique insight into


34
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:21,946
how technology could inspire


35
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:23,086
people and unleash their


36
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:24,146
creative genius.


37
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,536
And, we believed technology


38
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:27,646
could help teachers deliver


39
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:28,896
unique and personalized


40
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,366
experiences to all of their


41
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:31,076
students.


42
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:33,236
We have never stopped believing


43
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:34,926
in this goal, and never stopped


44
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,586
working hard to achieve it.


45
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,756
Over the years, we have created


46
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:40,896
a number of tools to make it


47
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:42,346
easier for schools to put Apple


48
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:43,936
devices into the hands of each


49
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,786
of their students.


50
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:46,446
And, I want to highlight one of


51
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:47,996
those now.


52
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,246
Classroom is now two years old,


53
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:51,966
and teachers really appreciate


54
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,046
the power it puts at their


55
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,596
fingertips to accelerate


56
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:56,656
teaching and learning without


57
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:58,036
technology getting in the way.


58
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,166
But, we want to provide our


59
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,536
tools on whichever OS our


60
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:02,546
customers choose.


61
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:04,296
So, we were excited to announce


62
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:05,596
at our March education event,


63
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:07,396
that Classroom was coming to the


64
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:07,756
Mac.


65
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,186
And, it looks like this.


66
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:12,816
I think Classroom looks


67
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:13,926
fantastic on the Mac.


68
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:15,426
It has the same great feature


69
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,236
set already available on iPad,


70
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:18,846
plus some surprises.


71
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:21,126
But, instead of describing those


72
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:23,016
to you, I'd like to invite Curt


73
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,676
and Raheel up to actually show


74
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:25,086
them to you.


75
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:25,176

00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,036
Team's been working hard to


79
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:35,186
bring the great Classroom


80
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:36,616

81
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:37,616
thrilled to share it with you


82
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:37,966
today.


83
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:40,056
To get started, I can just go to


84
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:41,516
Launchpad, and click on


85
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:41,976
Classroom.


86
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:47,606
As you'd expect in a Mac app,


87
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,186
all the actions in Classroom for


88
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:50,496
Mac are available in the


89
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,896
toolbar, from menus, and with


90
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:53,906
keyboard shortcuts.


91
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:56,186
For example, I can hit Command-T


92
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,856
to bring up my teacher info.


93
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,546
Oh, that photo's a bit much.


94
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,566
Let's go with something a little


95
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,636
more laid back.


96
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:05,726
That's better.


97
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:11,046
I can hit Shift-Command-N to


98
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,806
bring up a new Class sheet.


99
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,456
We have all the great icons and


100
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,646
colors that teachers use in


101
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:16,706
Classroom for iPad.


102
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:18,286
I have enough Classes for this


103
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,946
demo, so I just hit Escape to


104
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:20,646
dismiss that.


105
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:23,976
In the Classes view, I can drag


106
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:24,946
and drop to rearrange my


107
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:25,436
Classes.


108
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:28,446
And, I can just double-click to


109
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:29,426
start a Class session.


110
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,706
In a Class session, we have all


111
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,006
the actions that teachers expect


112
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,316
from Classroom for iPad.


113
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:36,426
They're available in the


114
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,036
toolbar, from the Actions menu,


115
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,456
and of course, with keyboard


116
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:41,106
shortcuts.


117
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,556
And, because this is a Mac app,


118
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,816
and I'm demoing on a Mac, I can


119
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:47,226
use QuickTime to show you what


120
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,496
this looks like from a student's


121
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:49,096
perspective.


122
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:53,026
So, now on your left, we have


123
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:54,666
Classroom for Mac, and on the


124
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,646
right, we have Raheel's student


125
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:57,006
iPad.


126
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:01,136
Let's navigate the students to a


127
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:01,986
website.


128
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:04,136
I hit Command-G to bring up the


129
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:04,946
Navigate sheet.


130
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,546
Now, I could use my mouse to


131
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,246
pick the site to go to here.


132
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,816
I could also use the arrow keys.


133
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:11,966
Let's open this great National


134
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,686
Geographic kids' site.


135
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,766
So, all my student iPads are


136
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,716
taken to this site.


137
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,046
And, I can even click this link


138
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:22,076
to go to the same site in Safari


139
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:22,656
on my Mac.


140
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:24,596
Now, while I'm browsing the


141
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:25,566
site, I might find something


142
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,616
else I want to share with my


143
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,046
students, like this cool Monarch


144
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:28,956
butterfly page.


145
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:32,766
I can click the Share toolbar


146
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,576
item, choose to Share via


147
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:37,276

148
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,686
class, and any manual groups


149
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:39,716
I've created will show up.


150
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:40,976
So, I can share this page.


151
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:53,626
Another thing that I love about


152
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,926
having Classroom on the Mac, is


153
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,216
that it gives me a great way to


154
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:57,666
keep my students on task.


155
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,116
I can see what apps they're in


156
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:00,606
by looking at these icons next


157
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:01,516
to their avatars.


158
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,536
And, through these Smart Groups


159
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,646
that show what students are in


160
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:07,106
each app.


161
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:08,766
It looks like Raheel's getting


162
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,516
distracted.


163
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:11,956
Brooklyn and Ella are still in


164
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,706
Safari, but it looks like


165
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:15,266
Raheel's browsing the App Store.


166
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:16,756
So, I can use another cool


167
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:17,796
feature of Classroom.


168
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,606
If I double-click on Raheel's


169
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,296
avatar, I can see his iPad


170
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:23,806
screen on my Mac.


171
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,006
And, while I'm looking at a


172
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:27,126
student's screen, I can perform


173
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,916
actions on just that student's


174
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,226
iPad.


175
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,226
So, in the Actions menu, I can


176
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:33,516
choose Open App, and then


177
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,326
Safari, and click Open, to bring


178
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:35,976

00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:06,166
there.


194
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:08,066
And, I can click to see a list


195
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:08,936
of shared items.


196
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,706
And, on the Mac, I can tear off


197
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,426
this Inbox, and place it next to


198
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:14,286
my Classroom window.


199
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,206
And, this is great, because I


200
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,366
can get at the items that my


201
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:17,696
students are sharing with me,


202
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,036
while still keeping an eye on


203
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:19,936
the class as a whole.


204
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:22,706
And, I can double-click to open


205
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:23,746
any shared items.


206
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:25,766
Well, that's a great bear photo,


207
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:26,296
Raheel.


208
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,256
>> I know, right?


209
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,826
It's unbearably great.


210
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:28,976
>> Indeed.


211
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:34,176
[ Laughter ]


212
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:36,326
Besides Smart Groups, I can also


213
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:37,906
create groups manually in


214
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:38,566
Classroom.


215
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,596
I'll hit Command-N to bring up


216
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:42,286
the New Group sheet, enter a


217
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:45,416
group name, and select the


218
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,426
students to include.


219
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,576
Manual groups are a great way to


220
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,956
get different groups of students


221
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:53,146
started on different tasks.


222
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,896
When I'm done with my class


223
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:58,136
session, I can hit End Class.


224
00:06:58,606 --> 00:06:59,436
That ends my session.


225
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:00,396
I'm presented with this great


226
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:01,166
Summary view.


227
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,716
I can see all the apps that my


228
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:04,556
students used during class, and


229
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:06,246
for each app, a timeline of when


230
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:08,336
they were in that app.


231
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:09,996
I also see all the shared items,


232
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,186
like the great bear photo.


233
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:14,026
And, for each student, I get a


234
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,796
timeline of all the apps they


235
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:16,876
were in, and when they were in


236
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:17,616
those apps.


237
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:19,856
So, that's Classroom for Mac.


238
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:21,756
We think with drag and drop,


239
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:24,386
keyboard navigation, toolbar


240
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,546
items, the menus and the tear


241
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,576
off inbox, the teachers are


242
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:28,786
going to love the power and


243
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,256
convenience of having Classroom


244
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:31,106
on their Macs.


245
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,016
And, of course, any macOS Mojave


246
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,566
app would not be complete


247
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:36,976
without support for Dark Mode.


248
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,146
So, that's Classroom for Mac.


249
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,626
It's available in public beta


250
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,366
now, and from the App Store this


251
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:46,726
fall.


252
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:47,356
Thank you.


253
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:47,976
Todd?


254
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:52,776
[ Applause ]


255
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,316
>> Thank you very much, guys.


256
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:55,686
Doesn't Classroom really look


257
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:56,556
great in Dark Mode?


258
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:57,806
I think teachers are really


259
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:58,646
going to appreciate having it


260
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,676
here, on their Macs.


261
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:02,096
Now, while education has been


262
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,436
part of Apple's DNA from the


263
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,126
very beginning of our company,


264
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:06,946
over time we've broadened our


265
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:07,856
audience to include the


266
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:08,606
enterprise.


267
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:11,646
And, in 2018 and beyond, we want


268
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:12,846
to empower people in both


269
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,546
schools and businesses around


270
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,346
the world to manage all of their


271
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:18,676
Apple devices, from iPad to


272
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,796
iPhone to MacBook to Apple TV,


273
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,066
as well as all of their apps,


274
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:23,856
whether they're in the App


275
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,396
Store, or custom enterprise


276
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:25,816
apps.


277
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,756
With the same technologies and


278
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,646
tools running on whichever OS


279
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:30,376
they choose.


280
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:32,846
And, that's why today I'm going


281
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,796
to organize the content, first


282
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,635
covering all the developments


283
00:08:36,635 --> 00:08:38,885
organized by the common features


284
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,285
available on all our OS's.


285
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,046
And then, continue through


286
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:44,275
capabilities specific to one or


287
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,026
more OS.


288
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,216
And, just to give you a little


289
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:48,606
bit of a legend ahead of time,


290
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,376
you'll see new badges up in the


291
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:51,796
upper right-hand corner on


292
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:53,576
slides where all of that content


293
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,126
is new in our fall releases.


294
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,986
There will also be specific


295
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:58,636
version badges on some slides


296
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,756
for things that have already


297
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,946
shipped in one or more releases,


298
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:04,296
and if there's a slide that has


299
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:06,076
some with version badges, and


300
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,636
some bullets without, everything


301
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:09,166
without a version badge is new


302
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,056
in a fall release.


303
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,156
So, with that, let's get


304
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:12,676
started.


305
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:14,846
The first thing is to get your


306
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,996
devices enrolled for remote


307
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:16,546
management.


308
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:18,646
And, schools use Apple School


309
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:19,616
Manager to do that.


310
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:21,956
Take advantage of the device


311
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:23,526
enrollment program to enroll all


312
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:24,806
of their devices with the


313
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:25,986
correct MDM server.


314
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:27,766
And, I'd like to bring you up to


315
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,486
date on all the changes in Apple


316
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,826
School Manager over the past


317
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:31,116
year.


318
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:33,726
First, I want to call out, is


319
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,386
now every student-managed Apple


320
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:37,266
ID comes with 200 gigabytes of


321
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:37,976
iCloud storage.


322
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,936
[ Applause ]


323
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:40,466
Definitely.


324
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:43,026
Creating more great content,


325
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,876
presentations and documents.


326
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:46,686
We've also made it much easier


327
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,836
for schools to create and


328
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,396
distribute passwords for those


329
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:50,596
student accounts.


330
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:53,406
We've dramatically modernized


331
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:54,946
and streamlined the experience


332
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:56,776
of purchasing apps and books in


333
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,136
bulk, as well as managing those


334
00:09:59,136 --> 00:09:59,966
licenses over time.


335
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:01,976
Being able to transfer them from


336
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,426
one content manager to another,


337
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:05,806
both within a location, and to


338
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,566
another location, as your needs


339
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,096
change.


340
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,816
And then, finally, a big


341
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:12,916
customer request was to enable


342
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,396
you to set a default MDM server


343
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,746
for a particular device type,


344
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:18,636
making it very easy to manage


345
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:20,236
all of your Macs with one MDM


346
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,966
server, and all of your iOS


347
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,096
devices with another.


348
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,456
But, we didn't want to just make


349
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,136
all this great experience


350
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,856
available to schools, we also


351
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:30,566
wanted to bring it to the


352
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:31,346
enterprise.


353
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:32,816
And so, I'm pleased to let you


354
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,156
know that we have now created


355
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:35,636
Apple Business Manager as well.


356
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:38,276
It offers the same great


357
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:39,836
features to manage accounts,


358
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:42,426
purchase apps and books, and


359
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:44,806
manage device enrollment, with


360
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:46,386
one important caveat on the


361
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:47,026
accounts.


362
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:48,676
Apple Business Manager allows


363
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:49,766
you to create accounts for all


364
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,246
of your administrators to manage


365
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:53,236
these other features, but it


366
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:54,436
doesn't not support creating


367
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,716
managed Apple ID's for all of


368
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:56,466
your employees.


369
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:59,116
It does offer the same, great,


370
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,476
integrated apps and books


371
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,926
purchasing experience, including


372
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,296
the license management features,


373
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,116
and all of the new features for


374
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:06,326
managing device enrollment.


375
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,716
And, it should very familiar to


376
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:09,826
anyone who's ever seen Apple


377
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:10,496
School Manager.


378
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:13,616
To allow you to create accounts


379
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:14,856
for your administrators,


380
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,396
purchase and manage your apps


381
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,606
and books licenses, and manage


382
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,326
your MDM servers, including


383
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:24,626
default MDM type.


384
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,336
So, until this week, Apple


385
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:28,556
Business Manager has been in a


386
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:29,246
private beta.


387
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,956
But, I'm excited to let you know


388
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:32,966
if you haven't seen the


389
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:33,876
announcement already, we


390
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:34,776
actually launched the United


391
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:37,146
States yesterday, and our global


392
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,456
launch will be in two weeks, on


393
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:38,976
June 20th.


394
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,296
[ Applause ]


395
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:43,686
We're very excited about


396
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,586
bringing all of this to, this


397
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:47,376
integrated experience to all of


398
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,386
our enterprise customers.


399
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:50,546
So, where and when will all that


400
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:50,936
happen?


401
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:53,906
Well, today, Apple School


402
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,416
Manager is available in 34


403
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,576
countries, and that's our global


404
00:11:57,576 --> 00:11:58,616
launch in two weeks.


405
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,666
But, we didn't stop there.


406
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,406
I'm very excited to announce


407
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:03,816
that in fact, this summer we're


408
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:05,556
also going to expand into 31


409
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:06,936
more countries around the world,


410
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:09,226
bringing us to 65 with support


411
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:10,726
for Apple School Manager and now


412
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:11,786
Apple Business Manager.


413
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:14,206
We're also adding book support


414
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:16,116
in Canada and Germany, which


415
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:17,616
currently only support apps.


416
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,796
So, I know the map looks great.


417
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:22,346
You can kind of see where the


418
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,516
expansion was, but I thought it


419
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:24,726
would be much easier to actually


420
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:25,916
see a list of countries, so you


421
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,456
can see if your country will now


422
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,406
have support for Apple School


423
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:30,376
Manager and Apple Business


424
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:30,806
Manager.


425
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:32,876
And, one thing I noticed,


426
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:33,636
looking at this list of


427
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,406
countries-- this is a World Cup


428
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,766
year-- that seven of these


429
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:38,076
countries actually have a team


430
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:40,086
in the World Cup, unlike, sadly,


431
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:42,236
my country, United States, but


432
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,496
that means I'm in the market for


433
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,026
a new team.


434
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:44,976
So, go Iceland.


435
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:49,636
[ Laughter ]


436
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,286
I wanted to tell you also about


437
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,596
another expansion of one of our


438
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,096
deployment program features.


439
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:56,276
You can add credit to your


440
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,206
account via purchase order to


441
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,396
allow you then to purchase apps


442
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:00,126
and books later.


443
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,576
Purchasing from either Apple or


444
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:03,336
a reseller.


445
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:06,156
And, we have just launched last


446
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,466
week in 10 new countries in


447
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:07,766
Europe.


448
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:09,436
Again, here's the list.


449
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,616
I believe that doubles our


450
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,426
access to this program as well.


451
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,346
The next slide is an evergreen


452
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:15,986
topic.


453
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,346
Every year we add new Setup


454
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:18,726
Assistant panes in one or more


455
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,086
of our OS's, and this year is no


456
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:20,656
exception.


457
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:22,176
And, we continue to want to


458
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,436
enable organizations to


459
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,846
configure the experience they


460
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,346
provide to their users as they


461
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:27,616
set up their devices.


462
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:30,136
So, in the spring's release, we


463
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:31,876
added a new privacy pane on all


464
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:32,726
three OS's.


465
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,666
We also added a new iCloud


466
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,106
storage pane for macOS.


467
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:41,096
And, two new panes for tvOS.


468
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,596
And, in iOS 12, there'll be new


469
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:45,746
panes configuring some of the


470
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,196
new features, some of which you


471
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,366
heard about earlier this week.


472
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:49,976
We want to continue to give you


473
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,376
that option to get your users


474
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:53,526
right to the desktop or home


475
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:54,836
screen as quickly as possible.


476
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,746
So, next, I'd like to cover two


477
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,396
updates for how MDM servers


478
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:00,746
should handle both enrolling


479
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,516
devices, as well as ongoing


480
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:04,476
communication with each of those


481
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,716
enrolled devices, starting with


482
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,496
Apple Push Notification service.


483
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,926
So, if your MDM solution is


484
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,496
still using the Legacy Binary


485
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:15,216
Provider API, we definitely want


486
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,676
you to adopt the new, modern,


487
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:18,896
HTTP/2 API, which is far more


488
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:19,836
capable and efficient.


489
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:21,856
You can read all about it in the


490
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:23,486
Communicating with APNs section


491
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:24,986
of the Networking documentation.


492
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:26,926
And, since I brought up


493
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:28,306
documentation, I wanted to take


494
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,736
a moment here to calm the waters


495
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,226
about the MDM and Profile


496
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:34,016
documentation.


497
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,146
The documentation team is going


498
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:37,096
through a publishing tools


499
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,176
transition, and the disclaimer


500
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,056
that you might have noticed


501
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:41,076
looking at the documentation


502
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,566
this week is not an indication


503
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,096
of any change in commitment to


504
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,106
providing up-to-date


505
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,706
documentation for all these


506
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:47,376
technologies.


507
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,536
In fact, the only reason you saw


508
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:50,596
that disclaimer is because we


509
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:52,456
did update both guides on Monday


510
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,336
for both the MDM protocol, and


511
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:55,486
the Configuration Profile


512
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:57,356
reference to cover the changes


513
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,746
I'm going to talk about today.


514
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:02,866
So, next topic is security.


515
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:03,906
There'll be number of these


516
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:04,926
throughout today's session.


517
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:06,416
This is something that Bob


518
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,046
talked about last year, that we


519
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,296
were going to begin requiring


520
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:10,916
transport security this year.


521
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:12,336
And, in fact, we're going to do


522
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:14,446
that in both iOS and macOS this


523
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:14,636
year.


524
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,466
Your SCEP server should make


525
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,076
sure to advertise its


526
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:20,686
capabilities, so that we know


527
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,296
what the highest level of


528
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,506
security you support, and don't


529
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,386
have to fall back to a lower


530
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,286
security encryption algorithm.


531
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:30,966
We stopped supporting DES last


532
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:31,206
year.


533
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,146
Definitely supports one of the


534
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:35,326
modern and much more secure


535
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,296
algorithms.


536
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:39,106
This year, I also wanted to give


537
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,406
you a note on how you can verify


538
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,496
that your server is ready for


539
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:43,116
this transition as we roll out


540
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,246
the new versions of iOS and


541
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,036
macOS this year.


542
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:48,796
You can use NSCurl against each


543
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:49,906
of the URL's that your server


544
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:52,126
supports, and verify that there


545
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,156
are no issues that the


546
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:54,466
diagnostics find.


547
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:58,096
Now, let's turn to the new


548
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,596
management controls, commands


549
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:00,256
and settings.


550
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:01,686
And, I'd like to start, again,


551
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:02,576
with everything that's supported


552
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:04,066
on two or more of our OS's.


553
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,766
You may have heard about some of


554
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,806
the new password features that


555
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:10,316
we're introducing in this fall's


556
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,146
iOS and macOS releases.


557
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:13,376
And, of course, we want to


558
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:15,046
enable you to manage them, via


559
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:15,626
profile.


560
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:17,896
So, the great new automatic


561
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,766
strong passwords and AutoFill


562
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:21,416
features within Safari and


563
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,086
within apps, we have a new


564
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:24,616
password AutoFill restriction


565
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,366
that also covers the existing


566
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,606
Safari AutoFill feature and


567
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:29,176
restriction.


568
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:32,016
We've also added a new password


569
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:34,066
sharing restriction that covers


570
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,936
all versions of the password


571
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:37,476
sharing feature, including the


572
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:39,156
previous WiFi password sharing.


573
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:40,936
And, this restriction prevents


574
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,306
you from sharing your password


575
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:42,996
with others.


576
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,376
The last bullet on the slide,


577
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:46,856
password proximity requests.


578
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,106
This restriction actually is


579
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,536
supported on tvOS as well,


580
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,646
because this feature, or this


581
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,436
restriction, prevents your


582
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,016
device asking others for their


583
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:56,566
password.


584
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,236
And, if you didn't attend, you


585
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:01,306
can check out the video of the


586
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:02,696
password and AutoFill session


587
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:03,736
which occurred earlier this


588
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:03,996
week.


589
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:08,146
We added a new restriction to


590
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:09,685
prevent users from modifying the


591
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:11,326
Bluetooth restriction last fall.


592
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:13,226
And, in the spring, we added a


593
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:14,336
new MDM command to actually be


594
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:15,866
able to set the value of that


595
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:16,256
setting.


596
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:17,896
And, I'm even more pleased to


597
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:19,256
let you know that it's not in


598
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,935
Seed 1, but I saw the change go


599
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:22,776
in yesterday, that this command


600
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,146
will now work even if you have


601
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:25,296
that restriction in place.


602
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:26,786
And, we think this will be great


603
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,546
for schools deploying Classroom,


604
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:31,366
and in other situations where


605
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,336
you want to make sure that


606
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:33,796
Bluetooth is enabled, or


607
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:36,066
disabled, as the case may be.


608
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,176
Big customer request, we have


609
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,556
enabled OAuth authentication for


610
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:42,856
exchange accounts configured via


611
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:43,386
profile.


612
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,986
That's in iOS 12, and in macOS


613
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:47,316
Mojave.


614
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,256
And, a really big one, managed


615
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:52,056
software updates that we brought


616
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:53,566
to both OS's this spring.


617
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,246
Thank you.


618
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:56,706
One person's excited about that.


619
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,376
And when I talked-- just because


620
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,656
I'm excited about it, talk a


621
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:01,776
little bit more in detail.


622
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:02,936
It consists of two different


623
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,786
restrictions, one to enable the


624
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:06,286
feature in the first place, to


625
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,436
put the device so that it will


626
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:09,826
delay when the user will see a


627
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:11,216
new update once we release it.


628
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,456
And, an optional parameter that


629
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:14,436
you can configure the delay


630
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:16,816
period from 1 day to up to 90


631
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:17,276
days.


632
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,586
If you don't specify that


633
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,426
setting, it defaults to 30 days.


634
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:25,466
The scheduleOSUpdate command has


635
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:26,746
been supported on both platforms


636
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,696
for a long time, and on macOS,


637
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:29,666
it's always allowed you to


638
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,896
specify which update you


639
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,336
actually wanted to install on


640
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:32,626
that Mac.


641
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:35,286
But, in iOS 12-- I'm sorry, this


642
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,626
spring, in iOS, we added the


643
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,106
ability to specify a version


644
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:41,436
number for just the iOS version


645
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:42,456
that you have tested with all


646
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,716
the software important for your


647
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,006
organization's devices.


648
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,356
Wq also added a new Apple


649
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,036
software lookup service, so that


650
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:50,976
your MDM server can look up the


651
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,536
eligible versions for a


652
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:53,766
particular device at a


653
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,576
particular time.


654
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:56,996
And, we have documented that API


655
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:58,806
to look that up, so that your


656
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,426
MDM solution can populate the UI


657
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:01,516
presented to the admin.


658
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:07,376
It's in the MDM protocol guide.


659
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:09,126
Alright. And, that brings us to


660
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:10,416
the end of our common section.


661
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,496
And now, I'd like to talk about


662
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:12,936
some iOS-specific changes.


663
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:14,806
Again, starting with security.


664
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:17,206
Now, some of you may have heard


665
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,986
about this change that we


666
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:21,356
started to make in iOS 11.3, and


667
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:24,056
now it's back in 11.4.1, and iOS


668
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:24,376
12.


669
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:25,836
And, of course, we wanted to


670
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:27,096
make this manageable as well,


671
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,296
beyond the switch that's in the


672
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,916
UI in iOS 12.


673
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,206
So, there's a new restriction


674
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,616
that allows you to control this


675
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:35,946
feature, and whether USB


676
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:37,226
accessories can still connect


677
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,496
devices if they're locked.


678
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,316
And, of course, Configurator


679
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:42,996
kind of relies on devices being


680
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:44,856
able to connect via USB, so we


681
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:46,056
have implemented a special


682
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:47,486
behavior for those devices.


683
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,216
When Configurator prepares a


684
00:19:49,216 --> 00:19:51,596
device to supervise it, but not


685
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:53,346
enroll it in MDM, it will


686
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:54,976
automatically install a profile


687
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:56,776
that installs this restriction,


688
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:58,566
and allows those devices to


689
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,386
continue connecting to the Mac


690
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:00,976
running Configurator.


691
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,186
Alright. Another topic which is


692
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,326
not new, we've talked about it


693
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:10,076
for a number of years, last year


694
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:10,686
Prodop [assumed spelling] told


695
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,266
you that we are going to start


696
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,226
honoring the certain set of


697
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:15,746
restrictions which were created


698
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:17,366
before supervision existed, but


699
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:18,736
really should only be honored on


700
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:19,876
supervised devices.


701
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:21,886
I want to make clear that these


702
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,356
restrictions are not going away.


703
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,366
They're still going to be


704
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:27,086
usable, but they will only be


705
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:28,886
honored on supervised devices.


706
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:31,156
But, after hearing your


707
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:33,716
feedback, we decided to delay


708
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,226
one more year, and we'll make


709
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:36,516
this change next year to help


710
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:37,926
make a smooth transition.


711
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:39,366
And, we've also come up with an


712
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:40,786
upgrade and migration policy


713
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:41,746
that we think will further


714
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:43,086
smooth this transition.


715
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:46,236
Essentially, if a device which


716
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:48,446
is not supervised has one or


717
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:49,716
more of these restrictions in


718
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,576
place, they will continue to be


719
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,896
honored even after upgrading to


720
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:55,966
the iOS version that includes


721
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:57,666
this change until they're wiped.


722
00:20:58,846 --> 00:20:59,876
So, we'll remember, and we'll


723
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:00,976
continue to allow you to use


724
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,366
them until that device is wiped,


725
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,506
allowing you to time your


726
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,476
refresh more conveniently.


727
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,066
Of course, any new device


728
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:08,816
configured, or if you wipe the


729
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:09,696
device and restore from a


730
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,076
backup, they will get the new


731
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,466
behavior, where each of these


732
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,086
restrictions is only honored if


733
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,156
the device is supervised.


734
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,456
But, of course, if you're wiping


735
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:17,506
a device, that's a great


736
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,536
opportunity to go ahead and


737
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:19,586
supervise it before you


738
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:20,786
configure it again.


739
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:24,596
Just to refresh your memory,


740
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:26,816
this is the list with one minor


741
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:28,146
change that we took advantage of


742
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:28,966
the fact that we're giving you


743
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:29,736
one more year.


744
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,576
That in fact, the three Siri


745
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:33,966
restrictions should also only be


746
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,396
honored on supervised devices,


747
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:37,986
so this is the list, and we


748
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:39,436
really mean it this time.


749
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:40,386
We're going to do it next year.


750
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,106
Be prepared.


751
00:21:44,456 --> 00:21:46,326
Alright. Managed Open In, it's a


752
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:48,726
great feature, most-- more used


753
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,416
in enterprises, and we've made a


754
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,686
number of improvements, both in


755
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,746
iOS 11.3, and iOS 12, to make


756
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:56,866
sure that the boundary we've


757
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,466
established between managed apps


758
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:00,796
and unmanaged apps and sharing


759
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:03,086
files and data between them is--


760
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,386
behaves the way everyone would


761
00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:04,856
expect.


762
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:07,346
This included making the context


763
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:09,076
API respect the boundary in iOS


764
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:09,856
11.3.


765
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:11,606
Which of course was exactly what


766
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:13,496
many customers wanted, but we


767
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,536
know that that did have some


768
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,196
challenges for some


769
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:18,076
organizations that were


770
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,616
deploying in a specific way.


771
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:21,076
And, I'd just like to make


772
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,056
clear, that if you are using


773
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:24,786
Managed Open In, and want a


774
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,676
managed app to manage Contacts,


775
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,606
you need to deploy that managed


776
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:29,816
Contacts source as a managed


777
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:30,356
source.


778
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,666
Alright. Now, let's turn to some


779
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,336
of the new settings we've been


780
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:37,566
adding in this year's software


781
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:38,036
releases.


782
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:39,616
A bunch of things we added in


783
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:40,766
iOS 11.3.


784
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,776
I already mentioned allow USB


785
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:44,826
accessories while device is


786
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:47,246
locked restriction, completing


787
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,646
our set of restrictions to allow


788
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,946
you to get classroom behavior on


789
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:53,406
a supervised device, even if


790
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,756
it's a teacher-created class.


791
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:57,276
We'll talk a little bit more


792
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,966
about the remote pairing later


793
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,176
on in the tvOS section.


794
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,156
And, that last one I really


795
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:03,276
wanted to mention, because this


796
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:04,746
is, again, another long-standing


797
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:06,736
customer request, that both


798
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:07,906
schools and businesses love the


799
00:23:07,906 --> 00:23:09,656
Home Screen layout payload, but


800
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:11,216
they were also using WebClips.


801
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,956
And now, in iOS 11.3, you can


802
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:15,496
use WebClips in Home Screen


803
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:15,976
layout payload.


804
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:19,776
[ Applause ]


805
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:22,706
Thank you very much.


806
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,396
Moving on to the changes in iOS


807
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:24,756
12.


808
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:26,486
Added a couple of new


809
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,196
notification types to the


810
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:29,236
Notifications payload.


811
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:30,716
And, another big customer


812
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:33,296
request, we had a lot of schools


813
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:34,556
in particular that wanted to


814
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:35,646
prevent students from changing


815
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:37,126
the date and time, and there's a


816
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,296
new restriction that essentially


817
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:41,156
turns on set date and time


818
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:43,116
automatically on supervised


819
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:43,686
devices.


820
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:45,626
Now, this feature will, of


821
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,826
course, only work if we can


822
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,296
reach the time server, or a cell


823
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,116
tower, or location services is


824
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:50,516
enabled.


825
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,826
But, with that caveat, we think


826
00:23:52,826 --> 00:23:56,866
this is going to meet the need.


827
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:57,876
We've also made a lot of


828
00:23:57,876 --> 00:23:59,356
improvements to how S/MIME is


829
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,316
managed for Mail and Exchange


830
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,016
accounts configured via profile.


831
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,156
Giving users more flexibility


832
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,496
about when to sign and encrypt,


833
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,566
as well as an important changes


834
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,406
to allow them to update the


835
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,526
certificates that they're using


836
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:13,436
for either feature.


837
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:15,216
Even when their account has been


838
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:16,316
configured via profile.


839
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:18,926
We also took the opportunity to


840
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:20,216
rename a number of keys to


841
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:21,326
clarify the purpose.


842
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,556
Of course, the existing keys are


843
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:23,626
still honored for now.


844
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:24,326
But, please check the


845
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:25,956
documentation and update your


846
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:26,816
implementations.


847
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:30,436
There's also a number of new


848
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,596
settings in the VPN payload for


849
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,636
configuring IKEv2 connections,


850
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,796
managing your DNS server


851
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:38,316
settings.


852
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:44,396
And, one important option that


853
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:45,586
we added to the Erase Device


854
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:46,086
command.


855
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:48,226
Allows you to skip proximity set


856
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:49,156
up on your way back through


857
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,506
Setup Assistant, further


858
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:51,756
configuring the device


859
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,076
enrollment experience for an end


860
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:53,486
user.


861
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,226
This is really important for


862
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:57,716
deployments for guests that are


863
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,056
using your devices, and if


864
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,256
you're using device enrollment


865
00:25:00,256 --> 00:25:02,306
to provide a fresh experience


866
00:25:02,306 --> 00:25:03,636
for each new guest using that


867
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:05,486
particular iPad or other device.


868
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:08,216
Thank you, Eric.


869
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:12,406
And, finally, due to macOS


870
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:13,966
server deprecation, we have


871
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:15,336
removed support for the macOS


872
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:16,956
server account payload in iOS


873
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:17,336
12.


874
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:18,946
If you're still using some of


875
00:25:18,946 --> 00:25:20,006
those services as you're


876
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:21,506
transitioning to a new solution,


877
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:23,846
you can replace those account


878
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:25,006
configurations with normal


879
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:25,846
account payloads.


880
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:28,806
Next, I'd like to give you a few


881
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:30,516
tips on troubleshooting issues


882
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:31,876
with delivering and executing


883
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,296
MDM commands on enrolled iOS


884
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:33,846
devices.


885
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,076
There are a number of logging


886
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,396
profiles which you can obtain at


887
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:38,206
the link at the bottom of the


888
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:38,716
screen.


889
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:40,496
And, all of the URL's are going


890
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:41,376
to be available at the More


891
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,636
Information link, which will be


892
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:43,766
at the end of the session, so


893
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:45,006
you don't have to feverishly


894
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:45,836
copy those down.


895
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,306
Depending on what type of a


896
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:49,346
problem you're investigation,


897
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:51,006
you can install either both the


898
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:52,576
MDM and/or the Apple Push


899
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:54,626
Notification service profiles.


900
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:56,236
Once you've reproduced the


901
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:57,866
problem, you can get those logs


902
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,106
using Console or Apple


903
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:00,026
Configurator 2.


904
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:02,696
And then, look through the logs


905
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:04,386
by process, depending on what


906
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:05,096
kind of a problem you're


907
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:05,796
investigating.


908
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,666
Whether you're looking at


909
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:09,936
communication, or connection


910
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:10,656
issues.


911
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:13,466
Installing profiles or apps, or


912
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:14,616
working with Shared iPad.


913
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:19,356
Now, next I'd like to turn to


914
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:20,586
cover some topics that are a


915
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:22,176
particular interest to app


916
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:23,306
developers, who would like to


917
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:24,406
sell their apps to schools and


918
00:26:24,406 --> 00:26:24,936
businesses.


919
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:26,896
Or, as I like to call it in


920
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,096
honor of the biggest fan of


921
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:30,336
initial iPhone, say it with me,


922
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:31,576
the developers, developers,


923
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:32,576
developers section.


924
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,166
I'll first cover some topics


925
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,556
specific to education apps,


926
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:38,986
before continuing with some


927
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:40,246
topics for enterprise apps.


928
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:43,536
At our education event in


929
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,666
Chicago in March, we announced a


930
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,986
brand-new app for teachers


931
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:47,906
called Schoolwork.


932
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,936
Schoolwork allows teachers to


933
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:52,456
easily share content with their


934
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:54,686
students, leveraging the power


935
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:55,596
of your apps.


936
00:26:56,086 --> 00:26:58,766
And then, they can view student


937
00:26:58,766 --> 00:26:59,956
progress across all of their


938
00:26:59,956 --> 00:27:01,296
work within those great apps.


939
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:03,356
Helping them to tailor


940
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:04,806
instruction to the needs of each


941
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:05,676
of their students.


942
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:08,686
And, also allowing them to


943
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,126
collaborate and provide instant


944
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:11,466
feedback on what their students


945
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:13,396
are learning quickly, and where


946
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:14,206
they might need a bit more


947
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:14,666
support.


948
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:17,956
Now, all of this is based upon a


949
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:19,316
new framework called ClassKit.


950
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:21,806
And, that's where you come in.


951
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:23,726
Apps which adopt ClassKit


952
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,106
integrate with Schoolwork in


953
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:26,466
order to help teachers discover


954
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:27,726
assignable activities within


955
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:29,686
your app, to take students


956
00:27:29,686 --> 00:27:31,236
directly to the right activity


957
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:32,316
for what they're supposed to be


958
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:32,946
working on.


959
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:34,616
And, most importantly to


960
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:36,376
securely and privately share


961
00:27:36,376 --> 00:27:38,136
that progress data as they work


962
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:39,726
through those tasks with their


963
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:40,326
teachers.


964
00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:42,416
Now, they had a session


965
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:43,486
yesterday, and I encourage you


966
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:44,496
to watch their video.


967
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,106
Alright. While I have,


968
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:48,456
hopefully, your attention, I'll,


969
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:49,766
you know-- MDM developers are


970
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:51,546
developers too, so this is


971
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:52,556
really more for them.


972
00:27:52,946 --> 00:27:54,116
But, I wanted to make sure I


973
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,146
kept their attention.


974
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,316
They didn't start tuning me out.


975
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,506
So, the Roster API is how MDM


976
00:27:59,506 --> 00:28:01,226
servers can get class


977
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:02,656
information from Apple School


978
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:03,156
Manager.


979
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:06,096
And, we have had this class name


980
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:06,916
field for a while.


981
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,346
And, we want to encourage you to


982
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:10,176
use that as a display name in


983
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:12,036
your MDM console, as well as


984
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:13,526
what you pass along to Classroom


985
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,096
via the education payload, the


986
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:16,456
configure managed classes.


987
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:18,146
This is because Schoolwork is


988
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,656
using that field, and we'd like


989
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,686
to achieve a consistent


990
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:21,986
experience for teachers using


991
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:22,676
both apps.


992
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:24,516
The reason you might not be


993
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,086
already doing this, is because


994
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:27,916
of class name's history.


995
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:31,056
Before January, it was there in


996
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:32,326
the API, but we actually didn't


997
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:33,006
return a value.


998
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:35,926
In January, we began returning a


999
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:37,236
value that was derived using


1000
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:39,006
logic in Apple School Manager.


1001
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:41,976
But, this month, we're going to


1002
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,296
start allowing administrators to


1003
00:28:43,296 --> 00:28:45,036
configure that name based on how


1004
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:46,756
the school names their classes,


1005
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:47,956
and what the teacher will expect


1006
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:49,436
right within Apple School


1007
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:49,876
Manager.


1008
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:51,656
So, again, if you're not


1009
00:28:51,656 --> 00:28:52,756
currently using that to


1010
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:54,136
configure the education payload


1011
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:56,586
for Classroom, please start, so


1012
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:57,706
we can achieve that great


1013
00:28:57,706 --> 00:28:58,806
experience for teachers.


1014
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:03,826
Want to, again, remind you about


1015
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:04,596
shared iPad.


1016
00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:06,486
If you want your app to be used


1017
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,796
in Shared iPad, need to make


1018
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:10,226
sure that it doesn't depend on


1019
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,756
any data being available locally


1020
00:29:11,756 --> 00:29:12,616
on a new device.


1021
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:14,046
When a student moves, and signs


1022
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,486
into a new Shared iPad.


1023
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,116
Persist all of the app data to


1024
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:19,376
the cloud, whether that's our


1025
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:20,396
cloud, or your cloud.


1026
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:22,366
And, while we'd, of course,


1027
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:23,706
prefer that you test your app on


1028
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:25,326
a real Shared iPad, you can


1029
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:27,886
simulate this by deleting all


1030
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,756
the local data, and then making


1031
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:30,836
sure that your app still works


1032
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:31,076
well.


1033
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:35,376
Also like to encourage you to


1034
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:37,336
adopt managed app configuration.


1035
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:38,276
There are thousands of


1036
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,136
developers who have, and have


1037
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,096
created a number of shared


1038
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:43,076
schemas that can make it-- your


1039
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:44,306
app much more friendly to


1040
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,176
education and enterprise, by


1041
00:29:46,176 --> 00:29:47,516
enabling them to create a


1042
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:49,956
customized experience for their


1043
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,536
employees or students, to


1044
00:29:52,536 --> 00:29:54,356
customize the look of the app,


1045
00:29:54,356 --> 00:29:56,706
or to prepare some custom data


1046
00:29:56,706 --> 00:29:58,176
to warm up the app so they get


1047
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,516
the right experience at first


1048
00:29:59,516 --> 00:29:59,936
launch.


1049
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:04,206
Here's the URL for the site to


1050
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:04,956
learn all about it.


1051
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:06,946
Again, that will be available on


1052
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,536
the More Information page later


1053
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:08,816
on.


1054
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,146
We also have a number of great


1055
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,456
enterprise partners, who've


1056
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:16,216
provided SDK's to make the power


1057
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:17,666
of their services available to


1058
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:18,426
your apps.


1059
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:21,606
From IBM's Watson to allow you


1060
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,326
to do machine-learning models,


1061
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:26,746
and we have great pages on our


1062
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,266
developer.apple.com website.


1063
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,206
They're really hard to figure


1064
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:30,716
out, because they're slash and


1065
00:30:30,716 --> 00:30:31,546
then the company name.


1066
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,246
But, I encourage you to check


1067
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,366
those out, and see what you can


1068
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,356
do within your apps.


1069
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:39,626
And, finally if your app depends


1070
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:41,636
on network performance, for some


1071
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:42,996
time now, we've enabled you to


1072
00:30:42,996 --> 00:30:45,396
configure that with profiles for


1073
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,956
enterprise apps and MDM


1074
00:30:46,956 --> 00:30:47,586
solutions.


1075
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,606
But, this year we've added a


1076
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,226
number of new quality of service


1077
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,486
keys to allow you to fine-tune


1078
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:53,276
it even further.


1079
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:55,816
Encourage you to check out the


1080
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:58,586
networking session, if your app


1081
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,806
is sensitive to network


1082
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:00,846
performance, to find out how you


1083
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:02,036
can achieve the best performance


1084
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:02,876
on our platforms.


1085
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:05,506
And, that brings us to the end


1086
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:06,826
of our iOS-specific section.


1087
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,766
So, following the pattern


1088
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:10,886
established by this week's


1089
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:12,416
keynote, let's turn next to


1090
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:12,726
tvOS.


1091
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:15,566
Now, with tvOS, we, over the


1092
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,296
past number of years and


1093
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:18,526
releases have been playing a


1094
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:19,446
little bit of catch up and


1095
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:20,326
adding some of the great


1096
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:21,766
features for device management


1097
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:23,416
that we had previously had for


1098
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:24,466
iOS and macOS.


1099
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,256
And, I'm very pleased to let you


1100
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:27,376
know that we continued to do


1101
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:28,016
that this year.


1102
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:30,696
This spring, adding the ability


1103
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:31,806
to configure content


1104
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,116
restrictions, just like you can


1105
00:31:33,116 --> 00:31:34,366
on iOS and macOS.


1106
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:38,266
And, enabling you to lock down


1107
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:40,396
which app, or which devices, can


1108
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:41,916
use the Remote app to manage a


1109
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,036
particular Apple TV.


1110
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:44,616
This is great in the classroom,


1111
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:46,066
so that the teacher can just


1112
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:47,496
have the Remote app on her


1113
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:49,886
phone, and you cannot need a


1114
00:31:49,886 --> 00:31:51,076
physical remote in the


1115
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:51,616
classroom.


1116
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:53,946
No student would ever get up to


1117
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:54,956
no good with one of those.


1118
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,186
And, perhaps, even more


1119
00:31:58,186 --> 00:31:59,746
important, some great key


1120
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:00,646
features of the device


1121
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:01,606
management experience.


1122
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:02,976
Being able to install App Store


1123
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:04,236
apps on Apple TV.


1124
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:05,976
Thank you.


1125
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:08,976
[ Applause ]


1126
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:11,126
And, being able to update to the


1127
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:13,036
latest version of tvOS via MDM


1128
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:14,806
command, just like another Apple


1129
00:32:14,806 --> 00:32:14,976
device.


1130
00:32:15,061 --> 00:32:17,061
[ Applause ]


1131
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:17,486
Thank you.


1132
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:20,226
And, we think that combining


1133
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:21,576
these new features with some of


1134
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,466
the features that we've added


1135
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:25,556
over the past few releases, you


1136
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:26,856
can do some amazing things with


1137
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,546
Apple TV, on its own, and in


1138
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,716
combination with other Apple


1139
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:30,296
devices.


1140
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:31,906
Provide new experiences to your


1141
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:32,396
guests.


1142
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,156
So, to illustrate the


1143
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:35,956
possibilities, I'd like to


1144
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:37,336
welcome you to the entirely


1145
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:38,996
fictional Hotel Cupertino.


1146
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:40,936
Such a lovely place.


1147
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:43,616
Where each enrolled Apple TV is


1148
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,286
programmed to receive commands


1149
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:46,626
from the hotel's MDM server.


1150
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,036
For example, including updating


1151
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:49,976
to the latest version of tvOS.


1152
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:55,126
And, installing a custom


1153
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:56,276
enterprise app to allow your


1154
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:57,116
guests to manage their


1155
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:59,366
experience, including ordering


1156
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:01,136
of room service, when they get a


1157
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:02,526
hankering for pink champagne on


1158
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,406
ice, or informing them about


1159
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:05,706
options for exploring the area.


1160
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:08,906
You can also provide your guests


1161
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:09,706
with great entertainment


1162
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:11,386
options, when they're actually


1163
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:12,846
spending time in your room, by


1164
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:14,016
installing App Store apps.


1165
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:16,976
And, this is the time when I


1166
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:18,826
would love to share a clip of my


1167
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:20,016
favorite show, Game of Thrones,


1168
00:33:20,016 --> 00:33:21,166
with you, but we don't have time


1169
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,086
for that right now.


1170
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,646
So, assuming your guests


1171
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:25,246
actually ever leave the room,


1172
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:27,296
and take some photos, they can


1173
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,526
of course, use AirPlay to share


1174
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:31,466
those photos, and display them


1175
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:32,936
on the big screen in the room


1176
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:33,806
you've provided to them.


1177
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:36,996
So, this is just one example of


1178
00:33:36,996 --> 00:33:38,426
what can now be done with Apple


1179
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:40,056
TV by managing it remotely.


1180
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,356
But, of course, there are many


1181
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:42,556
other types of businesses that


1182
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:43,626
could take advantage of these


1183
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,396
capabilities to provide amazing


1184
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:46,896
experiences to their guests,


1185
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,356
including integration with the


1186
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:49,706
Apple devices they're already


1187
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:50,426
bringing with them.


1188
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:52,096
We look forward to seeing the


1189
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,016
fruits of your creativity, even


1190
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:55,246
if it doesn't involve dragons.


1191
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:58,226
So, that brings us to the end of


1192
00:33:58,226 --> 00:33:59,336
our tvOS section.


1193
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:02,186
And, last but not least, macOS,


1194
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:03,536
just like in the keynote.


1195
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,276
So, let's start right at the


1196
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,026
beginning, installing macOS.


1197
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:10,025
And, I'd like to make everyone


1198
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:11,476
aware of the great new command


1199
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:12,866
added to the macOS installer


1200
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:13,896
this spring, called


1201
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:14,936
startosinstall.


1202
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,726
If you're installing from and to


1203
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:18,926
your computer startup disk, you


1204
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:19,835
can use this command.


1205
00:34:20,636 --> 00:34:22,406
And, it supports all the latest


1206
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:23,106
Mac hardware.


1207
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,966
It also includes some great


1208
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:25,906
features that allow you to


1209
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,346
install packages on top of the


1210
00:34:27,346 --> 00:34:28,716
freshly installed macOS.


1211
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:31,156
And, an option to start fresh,


1212
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,005
and erase that partition before


1213
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:34,646
you install the new version of


1214
00:34:34,646 --> 00:34:35,106
macOS.


1215
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:38,386
Of course, once you've installed


1216
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:39,565
the OS, you want to get enrolled


1217
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:40,496
for remote management.


1218
00:34:41,156 --> 00:34:42,386
And, we received some feedback


1219
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:43,246
from some of our enterprise


1220
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:45,216
partners in particular, that


1221
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,696
they really prefer the iOS


1222
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:47,746
experience, and felt it was more


1223
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:48,456
user friendly.


1224
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:49,446
So, we're going to take that


1225
00:34:49,446 --> 00:34:52,235
feedback, and simplify, and make


1226
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,096
the macOS MDM enrollment


1227
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:55,596
experience match iOS.


1228
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:57,566
It's not in Seed 1, but you will


1229
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:58,976
see it soon in macOS Mojave.


1230
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:04,366
I told you there were more


1231
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,176
security topics.


1232
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:05,986
Here's another one.


1233
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:08,186
We want to strongly encourage


1234
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:09,386
our MDM partners to take


1235
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:10,896
advantage of this new capability


1236
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:13,296
to make enterprise app manifest


1237
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:14,486
delivery more secure.


1238
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:17,136
The transition is easy because


1239
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:18,296
we're continuing to support the


1240
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:20,106
existing installApplication MDM


1241
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:21,396
command to install enterprise


1242
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:23,766
apps, but we really want you to


1243
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:24,886
switch to one of the new methods


1244
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:25,786
using the new


1245
00:35:25,786 --> 00:35:27,466
installEnterpriseApplication


1246
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,106
command as soon as possible.


1247
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,036
There're two options.


1248
00:35:31,246 --> 00:35:32,486
You can either specify the


1249
00:35:32,486 --> 00:35:33,556
manifest right within the


1250
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:34,536
command, inline.


1251
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,496
Or, you can specify certs that


1252
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:39,056
we'll use later to pin our


1253
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:41,146
request to fetch the manifest.


1254
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:45,526
Please read up about this, and


1255
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:47,496
make the switch as soon as you


1256
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:49,786
can.


1257
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:50,936
Now, this is not actually a


1258
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,706
change so much, because none of


1259
00:35:52,706 --> 00:35:54,446
these six payloads ever worked


1260
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:56,146
to install in a system profile.


1261
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,636
But-- because they only make


1262
00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:58,916
sense in a user context.


1263
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:00,706
But, next year, we're going to


1264
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:02,546
start treating installing any of


1265
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:03,596
these payloads in a system


1266
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:05,106
profile as a hard failure.


1267
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:06,916
So, you have some time to


1268
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:07,926
prepare for that, and make sure


1269
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:10,556
you're not already doing that.


1270
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,086
Now, let's talk about some of


1271
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,186
the new things we've added in


1272
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:15,516
this year's macOS releases.


1273
00:36:16,236 --> 00:36:17,886
Big customer request, you can


1274
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,916
now mark generated private keys


1275
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,376
as not exportable, so the user


1276
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,556
can't get access to them on


1277
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:22,816
their Mac.


1278
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:25,876
We added content caching last


1279
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:27,676
fall in macOS High Sierra.


1280
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:28,976
And now, you can configure it


1281
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:29,666
via profile.


1282
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:31,726
And, we've added a number of new


1283
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:33,176
controls for managing how smart


1284
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:34,596
cards are used on your


1285
00:36:34,596 --> 00:36:35,606
organization's Macs.


1286
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:35,836
Thank you.


1287
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:36,926
Smart cards.


1288
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:44,296
Last fall, we introduced a new


1289
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,696
concept for enrollments on Macs


1290
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:48,226
called user-approved MDM.


1291
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:51,856
And, this is to protect features


1292
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:53,056
that should really only be


1293
00:36:53,056 --> 00:36:53,876
available on an


1294
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:55,646
organization-owned Mac, and be


1295
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,566
tied to affirmative consent from


1296
00:36:57,566 --> 00:36:59,426
a user or an admin, and not


1297
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,816
configured via rogue script.


1298
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:04,156
The first example was the kernel


1299
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:05,366
extension permissions.


1300
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:06,846
And, we introduced this in


1301
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:09,426
10.13.2, although user-approved


1302
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:11,016
MDM enrollments was not actually


1303
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:13,176
required until 10.13.4.


1304
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,796
There will be more security


1305
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:17,296
features that will fall into


1306
00:37:17,296 --> 00:37:17,986
this group.


1307
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:19,456
So, this is something that's


1308
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:21,076
going to be with us, and in


1309
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:22,226
fact, next thing I want to talk


1310
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:23,316
about also requires


1311
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:24,156
user-approved MDM.


1312
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:26,386
And, that's the additional


1313
00:37:26,386 --> 00:37:28,696
support we made for testing apps


1314
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:30,446
for high stakes testing apps on


1315
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:32,256
the Mac, so they can achieve the


1316
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,406
controlled environment that they


1317
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:33,936
require.


1318
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:37,086
That support requires both an


1319
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:39,506
entitlement, as well as a Mac


1320
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:40,956
which has a user-approved


1321
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:41,396
enrollment.


1322
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:46,076
And, just like for iOS and tvOS,


1323
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:47,116
I'd like to give you some tips


1324
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:48,626
on troubleshooting issues with


1325
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,116
communicating with enrolled


1326
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:50,786
devices.


1327
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:53,296
Similarly, you can install the


1328
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:54,846
right logging profile for a


1329
00:37:54,846 --> 00:37:56,126
managed client, or again, Apple


1330
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,456
Push Notification service.


1331
00:37:58,346 --> 00:38:00,826
Get the logs using Console, and


1332
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:01,996
it's a lot simpler-- you can


1333
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:02,956
just filter for the Managed


1334
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:04,146
Client process on the Mac.


1335
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:05,956
But, I also wanted to highlight


1336
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:07,416
the profile's command line tool.


1337
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,726
It's a Mac, we're got Terminal.


1338
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:10,436
You can, of course, use it to


1339
00:38:10,436 --> 00:38:12,686
install and remove profiles, but


1340
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,076
it also has some great features


1341
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:16,656
for verifying your deployment.


1342
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:18,936
The first we added this spring,


1343
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:21,486
allows you to verify whether the


1344
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:22,936
enrollment is user-approved,


1345
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:24,756
with the profile status command.


1346
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,356
And, new in macOS Mojave,


1347
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:29,536
there's a validate command that


1348
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:32,386
allows you to confirm, or tells


1349
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:34,886
you any differences between the


1350
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,536
device enrollment profile in the


1351
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:38,046
cloud, and what's actually


1352
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:39,256
configured on the device at that


1353
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:39,626
moment.


1354
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:40,816
So that you can more easily


1355
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:43,296
detect when your change that you


1356
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,526
know you've already made in the


1357
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:46,566
cloud hasn't been reflected on


1358
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:48,296
the Mac yet, or the device has


1359
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:49,326
become unconfigured.


1360
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:52,076
So, that brings us to the end of


1361
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,186
our content for today.


1362
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:54,716
And, I'd like to quickly sum up


1363
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:56,226
some of the takeaways for the


1364
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:57,346
different groups, and different


1365
00:38:57,346 --> 00:38:58,316
audiences for this talk.


1366
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,836
Administrators, we hope you love


1367
00:39:00,836 --> 00:39:03,316
having access in more places for


1368
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:04,616
Apple School Manager, and now


1369
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:06,316
Apple Business Manager to manage


1370
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,586
all of your organization's


1371
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:09,836
accounts, devices, and apps and


1372
00:39:09,836 --> 00:39:10,316
books.


1373
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:13,136
Take advantage of all those new


1374
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:14,396
device management capabilities


1375
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:15,436
that we've talked about today.


1376
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:17,316
And, prepare for the security


1377
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,416
changes that will impact your


1378
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:19,086
deployments.


1379
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:22,606
For MDM developers, of course,


1380
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:24,226
we need you to support all these


1381
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:25,406
new features, because the


1382
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,516
administrators won't be able to


1383
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:27,896
take advantage of them until you


1384
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:29,096
do, in the solution that they've


1385
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:30,216
already paid you for.


1386
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:33,596
Please get on adoption of those


1387
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:35,146
security features to help us


1388
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:37,326
make sure that we are keeping


1389
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:39,086
the communication between


1390
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:39,966
enrolled devices and your


1391
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:41,756
product as securely as possible.


1392
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:44,726
And, finally, app developers.


1393
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:46,366
Take advantage of all these


1394
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:47,426
great technologies that we've


1395
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,856
made available to you on our


1396
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:50,326
OS's from ClassKit and Shared


1397
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:52,626
iPad for schools, to managed app


1398
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:53,856
configuration for all kinds of


1399
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,406
apps, and then the enterprise


1400
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:56,816
features for enterprise apps.


1401
00:39:57,226 --> 00:40:01,026
We have a number of labs, one


1402
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:01,976
later today after lunch.


1403
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:03,356
And then, tomorrow morning.


1404
00:40:03,906 --> 00:40:04,926
And, if you'd like to learn more


1405
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:06,156
about the new password and


1406
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,386
AutoFill features, they also


1407
00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:08,546
have a lab tomorrow afternoon.


1408
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:10,676
And, with that, I'll thank you


1409
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:11,566
for your attention, and hope you


1410
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:12,236
enjoy the rest of the show.


1411
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:12,976
Thank you very much.


1412
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:15,508
[ Applause ]
