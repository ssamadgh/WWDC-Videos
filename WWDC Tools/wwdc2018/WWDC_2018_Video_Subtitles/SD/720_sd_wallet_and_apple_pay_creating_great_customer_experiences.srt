00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:25,926
[ Applause ]


3
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,526
>> Welcome, and hello.


4
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:29,606
I'm Ben Chester, a software


5
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:30,746
engineer on the Wallet and Apple


6
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:31,156
Pay team.


7
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:32,836
And, I'm here today to talk to


8
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:34,556
you about how to create great


9
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,206
customer experiences using


10
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:36,996
Wallet and Apple Pay.


11
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:38,936
And to do that, we're going to


12
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,666
cover four topics, and see a


13
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,786
fantastic demo from my


14
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:42,186
colleague.


15
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:45,496
Firstly, we're going to cover


16
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,686
some of the key things that have


17
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:47,686
happened in the last year.


18
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:51,266
Secondly, how to create great


19
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,446
experiences with Apple Pay,


20
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:53,406
using some of the new


21
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:54,356
enhancements we're announcing


22
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:54,676
today.


23
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:57,876
Thirdly, how to get the most


24
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:58,526
from passes.


25
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:00,396
There's some updates to designs,


26
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:01,886
and some new changes you can


27
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:03,106
adopt for richer content.


28
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:06,096
Finally, we will talk about


29
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:07,626
digital to physical commerce.


30
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:09,106
And, to do that I'm going to


31
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,816
show you an example that we use


32
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:12,166
every day at Apple Park, the


33
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,556
Caffe Mac's app, and some


34
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:13,866
others.


35
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:15,826
So, let me first start by


36
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,686
telling you about Apple Pay


37
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:17,146
Cash.


38
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,696
Apple Pay Cash makes it easy to


39
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,736
get paid, and pay friends and


40
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:23,846
family using iMessage.


41
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,776
Now, you can pay in-store, with


42
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:27,956
apps, and on the web.


43
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,776
And, it's available in the U.S.


44
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:33,026
Most importantly for you, ensure


45
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,006
you accept Discover debit in


46
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,356
your apps, and with your payment


47
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,486
processor, so you can take Apple


48
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:38,996
Pay Cash.


49
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:41,886
Another feature that we


50
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,256
announced last year, that is


51
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:45,306
even a greater option, is inline


52
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:45,746
setup.


53
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:48,626
Now, inline setup lets your


54
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,666
users with no cards set up one,


55
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,576
and then return to the purchase


56
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:53,526
in one step.


57
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:56,276
All you have to do is always


58
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:58,236
show the Apple Pay button if the


59
00:01:58,236 --> 00:01:59,176
device supports it.


60
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:02,116
If the user has no cards, you


61
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,386
can use the Set Up with Apple


62
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:05,576
Pay button, shown here, to make


63
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:06,836
it even clearer to the user.


64
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:08,826
Now, when the user taps that


65
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,846
button, the setup flow is


66
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:12,226
presented inside of your app,


67
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:14,996
which reduces the risk of users


68
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:16,186
leaving your experience.


69
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,686
And, this is commonly known as


70
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:18,306
abandonment.


71
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,896
And, to support this, no


72
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:21,916
additional work is required from


73
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:21,983
you.


74
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,666
Once the card is set up, it


75
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,056
returns the user to the purchase


76
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:27,606
immediately.


77
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,206
We even automatically activate


78
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:31,146
the card via SMS.


79
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:34,206
Now, even with all of this, it's


80
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,686
still faster than manual entry.


81
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,396
And, you should adopt this in


82
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:38,506
your apps, if you haven't


83
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:39,606
already, for a great user


84
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:40,196
experience.


85
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,876
That's not the only feature we


86
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:43,796
announced in the last year.


87
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,326
To help with faster checkout, we


88
00:02:46,326 --> 00:02:47,716
also introduced error handling,


89
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:48,796
and that's been great for


90
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:49,266
developers.


91
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:53,006
Error handling gives you control


92
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,346
over nonfatal errors in the


93
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:55,046
Apple Pay Sheet.


94
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:57,386
And, this allows you to provide


95
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,806
your own custom error messages


96
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:00,906
to the user for billing and


97
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:01,626
shipping issues.


98
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:03,596
And, that's so they can more


99
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:05,256
easily resolve those issues, and


100
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,136
get back to purchasing.


101
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:08,286
And, that's great for higher


102
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:08,766
conversion.


103
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,176
Now, some tips for error


104
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:11,596
handling.


105
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:13,776
One thing we want to make clear,


106
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,096
is that it's still important to


107
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,296
expect fuzzy data.


108
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,826
The user has one set of data in


109
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,196
Apple Pay, and that's shared


110
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:23,136
across many apps and websites.


111
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,826
And, we don't want the user--


112
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:26,586
don't want to force the user to


113
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:27,836
conform to everybody's


114
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,616
individual business logic, as


115
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,066
that requires the user to


116
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,716
reenter information, which just


117
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:35,406
increases friction, and will


118
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:36,866
reduce your overall conversion


119
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:37,026
rate.


120
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:39,856
Instead, you should do your best


121
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:41,276
to accept a range of inputs.


122
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,416
For example, Zip and Zip + 4.


123
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,196
And, infer what details you can


124
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,066
from other fields such as city


125
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,036
and state from Zip.


126
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:52,016
Now, that's not all the features


127
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:52,566
that we announced.


128
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,556
We also launched in some new


129
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:54,106
countries.


130
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,546
And, you may remember this slide


131
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,186
from last year.


132
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,996
Well, this year, we're


133
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:00,746
introducing the following


134
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:03,596
countries, and we're also coming


135
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:04,796
to Norway and Poland soon.


136
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,906
Now, that's a great range.


137
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:08,996
But, one country I want to talk


138
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:10,426
about in particular, is China.


139
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:14,386
This year, we've taken Express


140
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,596
Transit to China, launching with


141
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,046
Beijing Transit, and Shanghai


142
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:18,486
Transit.


143
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,296
Now, this works fantastically.


144
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,106
You can buy a card directly from


145
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:23,186
Wallet, and get going


146
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:23,666
straightaway.


147
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:26,626
But, Transit is not limited to


148
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:27,256
China alone.


149
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,556
You can use Apple Pay to ride


150
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:30,736
throughout the world, anywhere


151
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,016
credit and debit cards are


152
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:33,966
accepted, such as Moscow and


153
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:34,216
London.


154
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,466
Well, that's it from updates


155
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,466
from the last year.


156
00:04:38,186 --> 00:04:39,656
Let's talk about creating great


157
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,886
Apple Pay experiences.


158
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,916
What is a great experience with


159
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,976
Apple Pay?


160
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,126
Well, it's one that is easier,


161
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,636
by allowing the user to checkout


162
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:52,376
as early as possible, with what


163
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,366
we call upstreaming.


164
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,426
It's one that is faster, by


165
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:57,816
making Apple Pay the default


166
00:04:57,816 --> 00:04:59,226
payment option, with what we


167
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:00,026
call defaulting.


168
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:03,056
And, clearer by making the Apple


169
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,986
Pay flow as simple as possible,


170
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,706
with what we call streamlining.


171
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:08,946
Now, I want to go through each


172
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,376
of these, starting with


173
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:10,896
streamlining.


174
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,996
Here we see a fantastic example


175
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:14,536
of streamlining.


176
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,766
The Apple Pay button is directly


177
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:17,846
placed on the product page.


178
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:20,446
And, this makes it so easy, as


179
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,946
Apple Pay is [inaudible] the


180
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,396
user's flow as possible.


181
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:26,866
Now, if your experience instead


182
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,426
is focused on multi-item


183
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,556
checkout, then placing the Apple


184
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,166
Pay directly on a product page


185
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:33,936
might not work so best for you.


186
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:35,986
Instead, you should focus on


187
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:36,866
Express Checkout.


188
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,566
In this example, the customer


189
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,956
has the option to checkout with


190
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,256
Apple Pay right from the basket,


191
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,146
and the user should be able to


192
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,186
reach this checkout from


193
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:46,276
anywhere in your flow.


194
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:48,716
And, you can combine both of


195
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,216
these experiences for the best


196
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,566
results, if that does make sense


197
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:52,916
for you.


198
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,656
Whenever you use this Apple Pay


199
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,496
button, it's critical to use the


200
00:05:58,496 --> 00:05:59,966
one provided in the SDK.


201
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,456
Let me tell you why.


202
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,766
Well, it's localized in all


203
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:05,646
device languages.


204
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:07,406
And, it's available in a number


205
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:08,346
of styles and colors.


206
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:10,896
It scales across all the


207
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:13,726
supported devices, and any


208
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:15,186
changes that we make, you're


209
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:15,946
going to get for free in the


210
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:16,236
future.


211
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,156
It's also supported all the way


212
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:22,016
back to iOS 8.3, and WebKit 10.1


213
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,446
on iOS, and macOS 10.12.1.


214
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:27,296
However, we're heard that the


215
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,606
button does not always fit all


216
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,476
of your needs, and so today,


217
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:31,936
we're announcing three new types


218
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:32,586
in iOS 12.


219
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:33,876
And, I want to show you them


220
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:34,646
now.


221
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:37,896
The first one is Book with Apple


222
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:38,116
Pay.


223
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,536
Now, you should use this when


224
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:42,106
booking a hotel, or with a


225
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:43,036
ride-sharing service, for


226
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:43,416
example.


227
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,336
Simply pass the new Book type to


228
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:47,546
start using it.


229
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:51,896
Secondly, Subscribe with Apple


230
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:52,126
Pay.


231
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,416
Use this for subscription-based


232
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:54,976
purchases.


233
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:56,856
Pass the subscribe type.


234
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:00,696
And, thirdly, Check out with


235
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:01,136
Apple Pay.


236
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:03,406
This is best used if you have


237
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,136
multiple references to checkout


238
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:06,446
on the same page.


239
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,736
Now, this really makes it clear


240
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,676
to the user exactly which


241
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:13,276
checkout performs Apple Pay.


242
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:15,806
That's not all the changes to


243
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:16,176
the button.


244
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,736
You know that we love rounded


245
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:20,016
corners and continuous curves,


246
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:21,496
but we understand that not


247
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,496
everybody shares exactly the


248
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:24,316
same feelings, and so this year,


249
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:26,026
we're allowing you to control


250
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,956
the corner edits of the button.


251
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:30,506
You can configure this however


252
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:32,066
you see fit to match existing


253
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,926
styles of your apps or websites.


254
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,166
If you want square corners,


255
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,556
simply set the button radius to


256
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:38,876
0.


257
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:42,126
And, if you set no value, our


258
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:43,266
existing corner radius will be


259
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:43,626
used.


260
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:46,306
Now, similarly, on older


261
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:47,436
versions, the button will


262
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:48,756
fallback to using the current


263
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:50,416
rounded corner radius, ignoring


264
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,526
any value that you've set.


265
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:55,616
The new types and corner radius


266
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:56,746
are available in iOS 12 today.


267
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,156
And, they're coming to WebKit in


268
00:07:58,156 --> 00:07:58,896
a future release.


269
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,856
Most importantly, fallback to


270
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,706
using older types on unsupported


271
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:04,166
versions.


272
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:05,756
Consider that cascade.


273
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,326
Using the new types will help


274
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:09,596
your customers purchase more


275
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:10,896
easily and clearer than ever


276
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:11,356
before.


277
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:14,206
Now, the placement and use of


278
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:15,836
the Apple Pay button is one way


279
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:16,786
to make checkout easier.


280
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,756
But, that benefit to customer


281
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,186
experience can be multiplied if


282
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:22,826
you combine this with guest


283
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:23,286
checkout.


284
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,086
Now, you should think about


285
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:29,086
guest checkout as your user's


286
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,056
first experience.


287
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,076
Now, blocking first-time


288
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,976
purchase increases friction,


289
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:35,226
which can lead to abandonment,


290
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:36,046
as we described earlier.


291
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,446
The user should want to create


292
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:41,596
an account with you, not have it


293
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,066
forced upon them.


294
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:45,006
Apple Pay offers you a great way


295
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:45,586
to do this.


296
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,926
You can use data from the Apple


297
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,456
Pay sheet post-purchase to make


298
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:51,776
account creation easy.


299
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:53,876
I want to show you an example of


300
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:53,966
that.


301
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:56,856
As soon as the purchase is


302
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,526
complete, and the confirmation


303
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:00,226
is displayed, account creation


304
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:00,806
is now offered.


305
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:02,986
User's email address from the


306
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:04,726
Apple Pay transaction has been


307
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:06,146
used, and all the user has to do


308
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,746
is enter a password to confirm


309
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:08,636
the creation of the account.


310
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:11,426
You can make this even easier,


311
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,356
using password AutoFill, and the


312
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:14,846
enhancements that we've added in


313
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:15,306
iOS 12.


314
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,106
So, that's everything for


315
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:19,596
upstreaming.


316
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:21,596
Now, let's cover making things


317
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:22,416
faster with defaulting.


318
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:27,006
Most important thing about


319
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:28,756
defaulting is that your users


320
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:30,426
will look for and expect Apple


321
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:30,656
Pay.


322
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,066
So, you should make purchasing


323
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:36,116
faster by setting Apple Pay as


324
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:36,776
the default option.


325
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,326
And, Apple Pay is a great


326
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:40,876
default option, because it has


327
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:41,496
the user's most up-to-date


328
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:41,976
customer information.


329
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,196
Even if the user has no card set


330
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,476
up in Apple Pay, as we showed


331
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:48,896
earlier, it still makes a great


332
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:49,186
option.


333
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:51,426
Let's see an example of


334
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,236
defaulting in action.


335
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:55,366
Here we see Apple Pay as the


336
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,166
default option right at the top,


337
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:58,896
and the Buy with Apple Pay


338
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,686
button is clearly visible, and


339
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:01,836
easily reachable by the user.


340
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:04,716
If you apply these guidelines,


341
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:05,896
you can make it faster than ever


342
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,106
for your users to checkout with


343
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,996
Apple Pay.


344
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,606
So, that's easier and faster


345
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,046
ways, but let's look at how to


346
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,656
make things clearer with


347
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,196
Streamlining.


348
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:19,856
Most important piece of


349
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,136
information about Streamlining


350
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,536
for you, is to prefer customer


351
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,576
information from Apple Pay.


352
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,686
Users have this data already set


353
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:29,486
up, and you can make their


354
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,966
experience clearer by using it.


355
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,496
When you request user's data,


356
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:36,256
it's important to only request


357
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,036
relevant fields.


358
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:38,966
Any additional fields that you


359
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:41,236
add will only make things more


360
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:41,576
difficult.


361
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:45,016
If data is needed that Apple Pay


362
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:46,476
does not support, you should


363
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:47,496
collect this before checkout


364
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:47,966
begins.


365
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:50,186
For example, the number of items


366
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:51,576
of a particular product, or a


367
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:52,766
voucher code.


368
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,256
Now, this year, we've helped to


369
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,176
streamline the Apple Pay


370
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,496
experience even further, by


371
00:10:58,496 --> 00:10:59,416
making two changes.


372
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,676
The first one I want to talk


373
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:03,896
about is zero total support, and


374
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,436
I want to show you why that's


375
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:05,936
important.


376
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:09,436
Here we see the Apple Pay sheet


377
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,546
with a discount being applied,


378
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,226
and the total is above zero.


379
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,096
But, if that discount had


380
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:15,376
brought that all the way down to


381
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,516
zero, we've previously not been


382
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:18,486
able to present this sheet.


383
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,786
Well, now we do.


384
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:22,556
You can see the discount has


385
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,476
brought the total to zero.


386
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:24,956
Apple Pay sheet can still be


387
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:26,896
used to collect the necessary


388
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,356
shipping details, and other


389
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,536
information you need for the


390
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:29,956
purchase.


391
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:33,616
And, zero totals also work well


392
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:34,416
with subscriptions.


393
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:37,566
If the introductory month is


394
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,456
free, you can make this clear to


395
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:40,656
the user with a zero total.


396
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:43,736
Now, remember, it's important to


397
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,316
clearly state the price of the


398
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:47,146
subscription, as well as the


399
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:48,436
promotional discount they can


400
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:48,766
receive.


401
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,696
Zero total support is available


402
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:53,516
in iOS 12 today.


403
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,996
And, it's coming to WebKit in a


404
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:55,666
future release.


405
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:58,116
Make sure to fallback to


406
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,896
existing behavior on older


407
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:01,236
versions, where zero total is


408
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:01,966
not supported.


409
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,466
Now, the second way we have made


410
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,546
the experience more streamlined


411
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:08,446
in iOS 12, is with three new


412
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:09,356
supported networks.


413
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,656
And, this means you can filter


414
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:12,896
the cards in the Apple Pay sheet


415
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:13,976
more granularly.


416
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,326
And, there are three new


417
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:19,726
networks: Electron, Maestro, and


418
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:19,936
VPay.


419
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:23,906
It's important for the best


420
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,736
possible experience to accept as


421
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:26,896
many networks as you can.


422
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,666
These are available in iOS 12,


423
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:31,666
and coming to WebKit in the


424
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,016
future.


425
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,436
So, we've covered ways to make


426
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,046
things easier, faster, and


427
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:39,006
clearer with Apple Pay.


428
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,206
I hope you will try these all


429
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,416
out, and make your experiences


430
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,156
better than ever, using our new


431
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:44,716
enhancements.


432
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:47,586
One final topic I want to cover


433
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,936
is Apple Pay on the web, and the


434
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,076
WC3 Payment Request API.


435
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:54,976
Apple worked closely with a W3C


436
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:57,106
working group over the past few


437
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,126
years to help develop the


438
00:12:58,126 --> 00:12:58,926
Payment Request API.


439
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,286
Now, that it's announced, you


440
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:02,366
may be wondering if you should


441
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,966
be using that, or our existing


442
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,136
Apple Pay JavaScript API.


443
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:07,776
Let's compare the benefits of


444
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:09,396
using one over the other.


445
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,246
The Payment Request API is a


446
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:14,486
cross browser solution, however,


447
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:15,866
it's important to know that


448
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,526
Apple Pay is only supported on


449
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:18,006
Safari.


450
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:20,486
If you choose the Payment


451
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,096
Request API, you do miss out on


452
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:24,236
some of the following features.


453
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:26,816
Error handling with custom error


454
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,046
messaging, as I showed you


455
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:28,326
earlier.


456
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,266
But also, automatic selection of


457
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,016
affiliated and cobranded cards.


458
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:35,716
And, therefore, your ability to


459
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:37,326
adjust prices of the user's


460
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:38,236
selection of these cards.


461
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,726
In markets and regions where


462
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,436
it's important, phonetic name


463
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:43,616
collection is also not


464
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:44,046
supported.


465
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:46,626
And, the Apple Pay JavaScript


466
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,216
API has a wider range of


467
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:50,386
support, going back to iOS 10,


468
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:51,696
and macOS 10.12.


469
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,566
Now, you should evaluate what


470
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,326
makes sense for you.


471
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:56,666
And, if you choose the Payment


472
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,976
Request API, consider using the


473
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:01,036
Apple Pay JavaScript API as a


474
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,316
fallback for older clients.


475
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:05,406
To make it even easier to get


476
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:06,796
started with the Apple Pay


477
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,446
JavaScript API, today we're


478
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,456
launching a demo page.


479
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,106
Let me show you that.


480
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:13,996
The demo page walks you through


481
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,326
all the steps required to get


482
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:15,656
set up.


483
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:17,636
And, it all starts with the


484
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:18,196
Apple Pay button.


485
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:20,936
You can configure sizes, and


486
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,916
styles, and locale, and see how


487
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,856
they change in real time.


488
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,856
The code required to drill the


489
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,776
button is dynamically updated


490
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:28,126
below.


491
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:30,656
And the page even allows you to


492
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:31,906
test out the Apple Pay purchase


493
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:32,096
flow.


494
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,746
Simply configure the JSON in the


495
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:38,066
request inside the page, and the


496
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,436
Apple Pay button there will be


497
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:40,456
used to present the payment


498
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:40,676
sheet.


499
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:43,276
The results of the authorization


500
00:14:43,276 --> 00:14:44,706
and success or failure are


501
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:46,126
displayed to you directly.


502
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,036
Now, it's important to note,


503
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:49,726
your cards will not be charged


504
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:50,596
when you do this.


505
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:53,456
It's a great resource to get


506
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:54,666
started, and I hope you try it


507
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:54,876
out.


508
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:57,656
The demo page is available here


509
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:58,276
online today.


510
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:01,216
And, that's everything we have


511
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,326
for covering Apple Pay today.


512
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:03,836
So, now I want to move on to


513
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,236
talking about getting the most


514
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:05,836
from passes.


515
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,356
Passes are where it all began


516
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,496
for us, and they hold a very


517
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,536
special place in our hearts.


518
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,436
And, we have some fantastic


519
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,166
improvements I'm going to tell


520
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:15,576
you about.


521
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:17,146
But first, I just wanted to


522
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:18,566
recap what makes passes so


523
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:18,916
special.


524
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,126
They are so easy to use


525
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:24,066
contactlessly or with a bar


526
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:24,306
code.


527
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:26,776
And, they're synced across all


528
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:28,096
your devices using iCloud.


529
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,896
And, we're able to intelligently


530
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,616
show them on the lock screen and


531
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:33,766
in Search for quick access.


532
00:15:34,286 --> 00:15:36,886
And, they continue that seamless


533
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,036
Apple Pay experience into the


534
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,476
physical world, which works


535
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:40,976
great for tickets, movie passes.


536
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,736
Those are great reasons why you


537
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,486
should use passes.


538
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:47,246
But, how do you get the most


539
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,316
from passes for your users?


540
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,356
Well, to do that we're going to


541
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:51,146
cover four topics.


542
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,736
And, we're going to start by


543
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:55,316
talking about adding passes to


544
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:55,696
Wallet.


545
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,526
And, we have some best practices


546
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:58,386
that you can follow.


547
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:01,406
Secondly, making passes look


548
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:01,776
great.


549
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,766
There's some new design options,


550
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:05,476
and some tips for making passes


551
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:06,856
work across all your devices.


552
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:10,746
Thirdly, rich pass content.


553
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:13,006
New ways to make your passes


554
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,126
more deeply integrate with the


555
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:15,936
system.


556
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,696
And, finally, contactless


557
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:19,786
passes, and how you can get


558
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:20,836
started.


559
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:21,936
So, let's begin with adding


560
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:22,676
passes to Wallet.


561
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,606
Many of you have seen or


562
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:26,026
experienced the full model UI


563
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,676
that was presented to add


564
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:28,336
passes.


565
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:29,136
But, there's a better way.


566
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:33,636
For almost all situations, we


567
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:34,996
recommend using our automatic


568
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:35,896
pass adding API.


569
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:39,176
To use this, simply call the


570
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:40,436
addPasses function in


571
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:42,226
PKPassLibrary, with the array of


572
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:43,306
passes you intend to add.


573
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:45,636
Now, this presents a simple


574
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,356
alert to the user, requesting


575
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,536
them to add or to review those


576
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:48,926
passes.


577
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:51,166
And, that's much less friction


578
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,146
compared to the full-screen


579
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:52,556
model UI.


580
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,026
And, the user still has the


581
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,666
option to review the passes in


582
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:56,946
full.


583
00:16:57,436 --> 00:16:58,536
And, you should handle that in


584
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:00,656
the completion, and present that


585
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:01,926
viewController if requested.


586
00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:03,936
In the demo you're going to see


587
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:05,226
later, you'll see how this


588
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:06,146
improves the experience.


589
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:08,586
So, let me tell you about some


590
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:09,656
other best practices to follow


591
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:10,415
for adding passes.


592
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,435
Now, we suggest adding passes


593
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:15,586
that were created outside of


594
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,596
your experience, when the user


595
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:18,465
enters the app for the first


596
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:19,526
time, if they're coming from an


597
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:20,566
unsupported platform.


598
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,185
They've not previously had the


599
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:23,376
opportunity to add those passes,


600
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:24,866
and that's a great time to offer


601
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:25,156
it to them.


602
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,476
And, you should add related


603
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:30,286
passes to Wallet in a group, to


604
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:31,006
reduce the friction.


605
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:33,536
And, you can make it easy for


606
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:34,836
people to quickly add passes


607
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,546
that they do not have from your


608
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,016
order history views, or previous


609
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,006
transactions, for example.


610
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:42,006
And, from those same views, if


611
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,446
your user has a pass in Wallet


612
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:44,946
already, you should link them


613
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:45,626
directly to it.


614
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,496
So that no matter where the user


615
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:48,966
starts their journey, in Wallet,


616
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:50,816
or your experience, they can get


617
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,686
to the pass.


618
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:54,056
If you follow all these tips,


619
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:55,666
and use automatic pass adding,


620
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,146
your users will love passes.


621
00:17:57,646 --> 00:18:00,226
But, how do you make a pass that


622
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:00,866
looks great?


623
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:04,536
Most important information for


624
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:06,946
you is that the pass fields that


625
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:08,836
you display to the user should


626
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,496
have the relevant and critical


627
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:12,596
information on them.


628
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,386
And, there're things that the


629
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:14,586
user definitely needs.


630
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:16,856
And, you can make them stand out


631
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:18,016
by using vibrant colors.


632
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,966
And, you should design a pass


633
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,266
that looks great across all your


634
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:22,846
devices.


635
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:26,836
Now, to do that, you want to


636
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,796
avoid reproducing existing


637
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,506
passes, physical ones.


638
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,816
We have some great templates,


639
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:35,156
and layout options to make these


640
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,016
fields stand out and make sure


641
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,426
that your entire audience can


642
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:41,236
work with these passes as


643
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:41,846
they're accessible.


644
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,926
And, secondly don't encode user


645
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,256
information inside the strip


646
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,286
image that we can see here.


647
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:50,226
You should reserve that for the


648
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:50,736
fields.


649
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,266
That's particularly important on


650
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:53,706
Apple Watch.


651
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:55,956
Because there's no space to


652
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:56,686
display that.


653
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,216
And, the fields are front and


654
00:18:58,216 --> 00:18:58,546
center.


655
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,776
Similarly, the thumbnail image


656
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,976
is also not displayed, and the


657
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,146
user cannot access the pass


658
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:05,476
details.


659
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,316
So, but we know sometimes


660
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,606
there's information that's


661
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:11,856
difficult to put all on the


662
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:12,556
front of pass.


663
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,006
And so, today we want to make


664
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:15,036
things a little bit easier for


665
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:16,986
you by adding additional row


666
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:17,416
support.


667
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:20,426
Let me show you that in action


668
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:21,456
first.


669
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:23,506
Here we see a new third row


670
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:24,346
enabled, showing the section and


671
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:24,906
the start number.


672
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:28,966
Now, that's a great way to layer


673
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,526
additional content, when your


674
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:31,896
existing information is already


675
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:32,526
a little bit long.


676
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,776
And, this is really easy to add


677
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:35,416
to your passes.


678
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:36,566
Let me show you how to do it


679
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:36,936
with a pass JSON.


680
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,216
Here we see the new row key be


681
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,696
using the auxiliaryFields, by


682
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,046
setting a 0 or a 1.


683
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:46,816
You can indicate that the field


684
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:47,796
should be split over the two


685
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:48,966
locations on the front of pass.


686
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,176
"Row" can only be used in the


687
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:57,336
auxiliary fields, and only for


688
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,666
event ticket-type passes.


689
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:01,106
We support values of 0 and 1,


690
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:02,506
and that's going to be coming to


691
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:02,976
you in a future seed.


692
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:06,216
On older versions, "row" will be


693
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:06,626
ignored.


694
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,256
And, in that case, auxiliary


695
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:10,366
fields will be displayed on one


696
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:13,206
row, up to a limit of 4 fields


697
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:13,626
per row.


698
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,096
So, make sure you consider this


699
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,166
when designing your passes.


700
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,996
And, test across supported


701
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:20,206
devices and versions.


702
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:24,476
So now, we've got passes in


703
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:25,756
Wallet, looking great.


704
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:27,906
How do we make that content even


705
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:28,186
richer?


706
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:31,346
Let's get the most from a pass.


707
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:33,266
You can include information that


708
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,696
the system can leverage to


709
00:20:34,696 --> 00:20:35,816
provide the user enhanced


710
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:36,506
experiences.


711
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,326
And, one of those you may


712
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:39,306
already know about, is


713
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:39,836
relevancy.


714
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:43,196
You can add relevancy by setting


715
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:45,766
the locations, relevantText, and


716
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,276
relevantDate pass JSON fields.


717
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:50,676
And, this allows the system to


718
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:51,836
present the pass to the user


719
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,136
just at the right moment.


720
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,436
We handle multiple relevant


721
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:55,866
passes.


722
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:57,966
And, if you're issuing passes


723
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,436
for a single journey, multiple


724
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:01,516
ones, then you should make sure


725
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:02,816
to add relevancy information for


726
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:03,486
each pass.


727
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,076
And, allow the system to


728
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,216
correctly present them one at a


729
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:06,956
time to the user.


730
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:09,756
It's not a problem at all.


731
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:11,116
Now, it feels like magic when


732
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:12,276
their passes are so easy to


733
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:12,736
access.


734
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:14,936
And, to date we're looking at


735
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:16,886
making passes even richer, with


736
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,356
something we call semantic tags.


737
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:22,506
The fields that we showed


738
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:24,516
earlier in the pass JSON are a


739
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,966
great mechanism for display.


740
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:27,916
And, as the developer, you have


741
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,016
full control over the field


742
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:31,806
names, and the format of that


743
00:21:32,516 --> 00:21:32,836
content.


744
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:33,726
However, that means it's


745
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:34,976
difficult for iOS to reason


746
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:35,776
about every field.


747
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:38,036
As everybody uses unique key and


748
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:38,546
label names.


749
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,476
Semantic tags changes that by


750
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:43,916
providing a structured way for


751
00:21:44,196 --> 00:21:45,876
you to augment the display data


752
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:47,566
with a fixed format data.


753
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:49,976
Let me show you how easy it is


754
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,766
to add to an existing pass for


755
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:52,606
an upcoming film I'm going to


756
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:52,846
see.


757
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,486
Here we see a sample of primary,


758
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:59,516
secondary, and auxiliary fields


759
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,366
from the pass JSON.


760
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:02,486
This film's called "Revenge of


761
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:03,026
the Passes."


762
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:05,056
It's showing at Apple Park, and


763
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,186
it's running for two hours and


764
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,476
45 minutes in theater F5.


765
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:09,606
Now, that's all the information


766
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:11,386
I'm going to need when I get


767
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:12,596
there to see the film.


768
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:13,586
And, it's going to be readily


769
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:14,176
available to me.


770
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:16,776
So, let's take that event field


771
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:17,716
at the top, and add some


772
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,186
semantic tags to it.


773
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,256
To do that, we add a semantics


774
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:23,236
dictionary to the field.


775
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,766
And, inside that dictionary, you


776
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,036
can have relevant key names from


777
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,046
my documentation to provide


778
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,176
machine-readable content.


779
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:33,336
For example, with the movie, the


780
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:35,066
name used for display may differ


781
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,786
from the full official name used


782
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:37,446
internationally.


783
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:39,526
And the same might apply to your


784
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:40,026
venue name.


785
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:41,936
These should be the official


786
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:43,486
names that are different from


787
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:43,966
display.


788
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:46,466
You're also able to add


789
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:48,626
additional related data that is


790
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:49,906
not important for display, but


791
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:51,706
associated with that field.


792
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:54,476
For example, the phone number.


793
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:55,896
Now, sometimes, you have


794
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,526
semantic data that is not


795
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,756
associated with fields.


796
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:01,406
And, to capture that, we can use


797
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:02,466
a top-level semantics


798
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:02,836
dictionary.


799
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:05,106
Here, I've added a semantic tag


800
00:23:05,106 --> 00:23:06,386
indicating that while this pass


801
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,866
is relevant, silence should be


802
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:08,406
requested.


803
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:11,366
I've also indicated the duration


804
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,036
of the event in seconds, and


805
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:14,166
specified the event type.


806
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:16,596
You may have seen this in the


807
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,506
Keynote, Siri will then be able


808
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,206
to offer the user the ability to


809
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,776
quickly enable do not disturb at


810
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,436
the right time.


811
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:24,666
It just works.


812
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:25,846
And, it's great for things like


813
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:27,576
movie tickets, or event passes.


814
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,316
Now, in summary, semantic tags


815
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:33,306
are a great way to add


816
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:34,596
machine-readable content to your


817
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:34,996
passes.


818
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,676
And, we have over 70 supported


819
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:40,056
transit and event tags.


820
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:42,576
All these keys will be available


821
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:43,706
in our online documentation


822
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:44,026
soon.


823
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:46,576
And, one important thing to


824
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:48,716
note, relevancy information


825
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:49,916
works in combination with


826
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:50,646
semantic tags.


827
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:52,176
And so, you should add both to


828
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:53,206
your passes for the best


829
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:53,806
experience.


830
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:56,746
Now, bringing all this together,


831
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:58,346
I want to talk to you about


832
00:23:58,346 --> 00:23:59,666
contactless passes.


833
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:03,296
Contactless passes are a great


834
00:24:03,296 --> 00:24:05,526
way for users to interact with


835
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:05,846
Wallet.


836
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:07,606
And, it's a much improved


837
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,176
experience over scanning a


838
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:09,626
barcode.


839
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,246
I want to show you one of our


840
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,496
favorite uses of contactless


841
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:13,916
passes.


842
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,136
Internationally renowned,


843
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:17,946
Wembley Stadium in London had


844
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,136
famous football players record


845
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:20,586
an advert just to show how easy


846
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:20,976
it is to use.


847
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:48,500
[ Music ]


848
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,106
It really couldn't be any


849
00:24:53,106 --> 00:24:53,386
easier.


850
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,596
And, that contactless feels like


851
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,386
magic when you combine it with


852
00:24:57,386 --> 00:24:58,406
relevancy for lock screen


853
00:24:58,406 --> 00:24:59,626
access, swiping down for


854
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:00,266
notification.


855
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,786
Contactless passes do require an


856
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,376
NFC certificate to get started.


857
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,016
Now, you should contact us for


858
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:10,766
access if you have a great use


859
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:11,106
case.


860
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:14,156
One other important thing to


861
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:15,856
remember is that contactless


862
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:18,606
readers you select must support


863
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:19,996
Apple's value-added services


864
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:20,406
protocol.


865
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:22,916
However, that's easier than


866
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:23,596
ever.


867
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:26,436
You can find readers from any of


868
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:27,446
these companies that support


869
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:28,006
this protocol.


870
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,806
Now, one final use of


871
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:32,906
contactless passes you may have


872
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,226
seen in the Keynote, is student


873
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:35,876
ID cards.


874
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:38,406
Students will be able to use


875
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:40,796
these to access and pay anywhere


876
00:25:40,796 --> 00:25:42,466
physical student ID cards are


877
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:44,266
used today, right from Wallet.


878
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:46,656
We worked closely with two


879
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:47,746
companies to bring student ID

00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,476
features that we've covered here

00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:54,786
today.


885
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:56,246

00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:12,206
engineer on the Wallet and Apple


891
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:12,826
Pay team.


892
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:14,866
Today, I'm going to be showing


893
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,876
you a Swift application, where a


894
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,446
user can purchase an event


895
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,686
ticket for a party that I'm


896
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,006
throwing this weekend for my


897
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:21,376
team.


898
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:23,416
My colleagues will be able to


899
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,376
use the app in order to purchase


900
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,046
a ticket, and make me a little


901
00:26:27,046 --> 00:26:27,836
money on the side.


902
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,436
This app will demonstrate two


903
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:30,796
things.


904
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:33,566
First, how to use the best


905
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,636
practices and new API's that Ben


906
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,376
had mentioned earlier in order


907
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,586
to create the most seamless


908
00:26:38,826 --> 00:26:40,566
Wallet and Apple Pay experience.


909
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:44,566
And, second, how to structure


910
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:45,456
your pass's JSON in order to


911
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:46,856
enhance your customer's


912
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,376
experience.


913
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:51,016
So, let's go ahead and take a


914
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:51,976
look at this app.


915
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,676
So, here we're presented with a


916
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:54,946
summary about the event, a date,


917
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:57,696
a time, a location, and a cost.


918
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:00,356
Here's an example of


919
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:01,876
upstreaming, where we place the


920
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:03,206

921
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,656
directly on the product page.


922
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:07,866
So, let's go ahead and purchase


923
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:09,976
this ticket.


924
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,166
You can see, we're presented


925
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,376
with the Apple Pay sheet, and


926
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:15,766
this is a good example of


927
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:18,166
streamlining, asking the user


928
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,116
for the least amount of


929
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:20,166
information possible.


930
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:21,596
In this case, only their email


931
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:21,856

932
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,076
So, let me go ahead and Face ID


933
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,246
in order to complete this


934
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:25,606

935
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:34,566
Here, we're shown more


936
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,776
information about what we just


937
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:36,876
bought, about the event.


938
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:39,446
And, here at the bottom we have


939
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,856
a QR code, and all the way below


940
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:43,566
that, obstructed from view, is


941
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,016
an Add to Apple Wallet button.


942
00:27:45,486 --> 00:27:47,416
You might have seen many apps in


943
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,866
the App Store today do something


944
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:50,906
like this, embedding a QR code


945
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:51,376
in their app.


946
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:53,956
If you have a QR code on the


947
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:55,336
front of your pass, there's no


948
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:56,856
need to embed it within your


949
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:57,936
app.


950
00:27:58,256 --> 00:27:59,986
So, let's go ahead and add this


951
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:00,296
pass to Wallet.


952
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,526
You can see, we're presented


953
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:07,166
with the pass for the user to


954
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:07,596
review.


955
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,536
It has information about the


956
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,816
event, and a QR code.


957
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:12,576
So, let's add it.


958
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:17,486
Now, let's go over to the JSON,


959
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,436
and-- for this pass, and see


960
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:20,506
what changes we can make in


961
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:21,956
order to enhance the customer's


962
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:22,526
experience.


963
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:26,646
There are two major changes I


964
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:27,316
want to make here.


965
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:30,196
First, when people come to my


966
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:31,596
event, I want to check them in


967
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:33,036
using a contactless reader.


968
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:36,716
And, second, when the user gets


969
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:39,166
close to my event location, and


970
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:41,066
in this case, Discovery Meadow,


971
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,696
I want the pass to become


972
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:43,966
relevant on the lock screen.


973
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:47,116
So, let's first take a look at


974
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,476
this barcode dictionary here.


975
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,706
Since I'm going to be checking


976
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:52,626
people in using a contactless


977
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:54,416
reader, there's no need to have


978
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,956
a QR code on the front anymore.


979
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,176
So, let's remove this


980
00:28:57,226 --> 00:28:57,726
dictionary.


981
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:00,696
And, instead, let's replace it


982
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:01,956
with an NFC dictionary.


983
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:06,286
Here, this dictionary contains


984
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,446
information that we've passed


985
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:09,676
from the device to the reader in


986
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:11,306
order to identify them when they


987
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:12,446
check in.


988
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:15,496
Next, let's add location data to


989
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:17,026
this pass, so it can become


990
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,206
relevant on the lock screen.


991
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:23,006
Here, we set a latitude, a


992
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:25,476
longitude, in this case it's


993
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:27,286
Discovery Meadow, and relevant


994
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:28,446
text that will be displayed in


995
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:29,716
the notification on the lock


996
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:29,976
screen.


997
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:33,776
Now, let's take a look at the


998
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:35,716
Swift application, in order to


999
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,016
see what changes we can make


1000
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:37,706
there as well.


1001
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:42,666
Let's first take a look at this


1002
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:44,156
presentAddPass method.


1003
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:47,086
This was called when we tapped


1004
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:47,976
the Add to Wallet button.


1005
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:52,176
Here, we got the pass from a


1006
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:53,276
function we called, called


1007
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:53,666
eventPass.


1008
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,396
Let's go ahead and replace this


1009
00:29:56,396 --> 00:29:57,686
with our newly modified pass.


1010
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:03,016
We then instantiated a


1011
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:05,006
PKAddPassesViewController with


1012
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:07,906
that pass, and presented it.


1013
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:09,816
But, as Ben had mentioned


1014
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:11,626
earlier, there's a better API we


1015
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:12,686
can use in order to


1016
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,106
automatically add passes to


1017
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:14,436
Wallet.


1018
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,346
So, let's go ahead and remove


1019
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:17,716
these two lines of code, and


1020
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:18,746
replace it with that API.


1021
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:22,856
That API's on the PKPass


1022
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,206
library, so let's create an


1023
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:24,956
instance of that.


1024
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:29,006
And, let's call the API.


1025
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,096
The function's called addPasses.


1026
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:36,206
Takes an array of passes, has a


1027
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:37,586
completion handler with a


1028
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,026
status.


1029
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:39,716
And, there are three possible


1030
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:40,956
statuses that can be returned.


1031
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:44,146
DidAddPasses, which means the


1032
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:45,456
user wants to add the pass to


1033
00:30:45,456 --> 00:30:45,786
Wallet.


1034
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:48,626
DidCancelAddPasses, which means


1035
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:49,526
the user does not want to add


1036
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:50,236
the pass to Wallet.


1037
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,266
And, shouldReviewPasses.


1038
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:55,116
In this case, the user wishes to


1039
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:56,376
be presented with a preview of


1040
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,886
the pass before deciding to add


1041
00:30:58,886 --> 00:30:59,616
it to Wallet or not.


1042
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,886
And, if this is the case, you


1043
00:31:01,886 --> 00:31:03,876
should do what we did previously


1044
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,466
and instantiate a


1045
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:07,426
PKAddPassesViewController and


1046
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:07,906
present it.


1047
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:11,436
Now, let's go up to the


1048
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,206
viewDidLoad method.


1049
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:14,486
As we saw, there was a QR code


1050
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:14,616
here.


1051
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:18,086
Again, if your pass has a QR


1052
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,836
code on the front, there's no


1053
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,136
need to have it in your app.


1054
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:22,316
And, since our pass is now


1055
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:24,126
NFC-capable, we don't need this


1056
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:24,956
view anymore.


1057
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:26,536
So, let's go ahead and remove


1058
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:26,976
these lines of code.


1059
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:36,416
Here is the PKAddPassButton, or


1060
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,856
our Add to Wallet button.


1061
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,726
In order to-- another way to


1062
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:42,606
enhance the user's experience is


1063
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:44,536
when the summary view is


1064
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:45,656
presented right after they've


1065
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,126
purchased the ticket, we


1066
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:49,786
immediately ask them if they


1067
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,056
want to add the pass to Wallet,


1068
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,556
rather than having a button


1069
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:53,146
onscreen.


1070
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:55,936
Of course, you can have this Add


1071
00:31:55,936 --> 00:31:57,686
to Apple Wallet button somewhere


1072
00:31:57,686 --> 00:31:58,866
else in your app, if the user


1073
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:00,756
decides to add the pass later.


1074
00:32:02,216 --> 00:32:03,386
So, let's go ahead and remove


1075
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:03,986
this button.


1076
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:08,216
And, instead, we're going to


1077
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,446
replace it with a View in Wallet


1078
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:10,776
button.


1079
00:32:14,046 --> 00:32:15,776
That way, the user can tap this


1080
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:16,946
button, and they'll be brought


1081
00:32:16,946 --> 00:32:18,366
directly to a Wallet, and be


1082
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:19,606
shown the pass that they just


1083
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:19,966
added.


1084
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:25,366
And, finally, when the view is


1085
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:27,046
presented, let's immediately ask


1086
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:27,886
them if they want to add the


1087
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:27,976
pass.


1088
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,706
Now, that we've made these


1089
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:34,416
changes, let's deploy to the


1090
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,866
device, and see what it looks


1091
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:35,976
like.


1092
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:46,356
Again, we're presented with the


1093
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:48,496
same view, a summary about the


1094
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:48,996
event.


1095
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,376
I'll go ahead and purchase this


1096
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:50,976
pass again.


1097
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:00,946
And now, you can see we're


1098
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,536
immediately asked if we want to


1099
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:03,446
add the pass to Wallet.


1100
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,816
And, you can see in the


1101
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,666
background code, the QR code is


1102
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:07,306
no longer there.


1103
00:33:07,456 --> 00:33:10,986
And, the Add to Apple Wallet


1104
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:12,226
button is replaced with the View


1105
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:12,896
in Wallet button.


1106
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:14,976
So, I want to add this pass to


1107
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:15,276
Wallet.


1108
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,976
And, let's go ahead and view it.


1109
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,456
You see, we're immediately taken


1110
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:23,116
to the pass, and you can see the


1111
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:24,436
QR code is no longer on the


1112
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:24,766
front.


1113
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:26,596
And, instead we have a Hold Near


1114
00:33:26,596 --> 00:33:28,496
Reader displayed at the bottom,


1115
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:29,856
meaning that our pass is now


1116
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,496
contactless, and I could scan it


1117
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:33,636
a reader when I arrive at the


1118
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:33,966
event.


1119
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:37,276
Now, let's lock the device, and


1120
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:38,626
since we're close to Discovery


1121
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:40,516
Meadow here in San Jose, let's


1122
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:42,626
see if the pass is relevant on


1123
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:42,976
the lock screen.


1124
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:47,586
Here's the notification for the


1125
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:49,646
pass with the text that we set


1126
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:50,436
in the JSON.


1127
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:52,306
Let's tap our notification.


1128
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:54,466
The pass is immediately


1129
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,236
displayed, and I happen to have


1130
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:57,976
a contactless reader here on


1131
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,326
stage, so let's simulate me


1132
00:33:59,326 --> 00:33:59,976
arriving at the event.


1133
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:04,376
And, it's as simple as that.


1134
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:09,416
We hope that you can adopt these


1135
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:11,136
simple changes in order to


1136
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,255
enhance your customer's


1137
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,976
experience when they interact


1138
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,636
with Wallet and Apple Pay in


1139
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,196
your app.


1140
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:18,356
And now, I'll hand it back over


1141
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:18,786
to Ben.


1142
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:23,045
[ Applause ]


1143
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:24,246
>> Thank you Katie, for that


1144
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,025
fantastic demo.


1145
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:26,916
What an improvement those


1146
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,376
changes made to the experience.


1147
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:31,246
So, the final topic we want to


1148
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:33,676
cover today is digital to


1149
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:34,636
physical commerce.


1150
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,996
Now, using Apple Pay is a great


1151
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:38,616
way to buy, but that's not where


1152
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:39,786
the user's journey ends.


1153
00:34:40,835 --> 00:34:42,106
It's important to carry through


1154
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:43,326
that seamless experience into


1155
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:44,045
the physical world.


1156
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,466
Now, to do that, I want to show


1157
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:47,076
you two examples.


1158
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:48,766
Starting with the Caffe Macs


1159
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,436
app, that's used by thousands of


1160
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,826
employees every day at Apple


1161
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:52,156
Park.


1162
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:55,666
Here, I launched the app, and


1163
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,206
I'm immediately presented with


1164
00:34:57,206 --> 00:34:58,466
the best offers on offer today.


1165
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:01,096
It's a great way to engage me.


1166
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:02,996
It doesn't require me to browse


1167
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:04,086
through all the items in the


1168
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:04,296
app.


1169
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:07,036
You might be wondering why you


1170
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:08,056
don't see the Apple Pay button


1171
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:08,486
immediately.


1172
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:10,246
And, that's because I'm not


1173
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:11,166
inside Caffe Macs.


1174
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:14,266
As soon as I get close, using


1175
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,426
GPS and Bluetooth beacons, the


1176
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:17,956
app detects that change, and the


1177
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:18,576
button appears.


1178
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:20,946
This allows me to buy right from


1179
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:21,746
the starting page.


1180
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:22,896
It's a great example of


1181
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:23,326
upstreaming.


1182
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:26,216
Sometimes I order more than one


1183
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:27,416
thing, and Caffe Macs has me


1184
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:27,716
covered.


1185
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:30,526
They support both the multi-item


1186
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,736
express checkout, as well as a


1187
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,656
single-item purchase flow right


1188
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:35,426
from the product page.


1189
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:38,116
I can also check out from


1190
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:39,636
anywhere in the app, using the


1191
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:40,416
Pay tab below.


1192
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,156
Now, this is a great pattern to


1193
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:44,486
follow to make checkout easy.


1194
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:47,726
When I'm ready to pay, I Face


1195
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:48,776
ID, and I'm done.


1196
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:51,516
Here, you can see that following


1197
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,756
our guidelines, and requesting


1198
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:53,806
as little information as


1199
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:54,216
possible.


1200
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:56,376
I'm already logged in across


1201
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,226
multiple Apple apps, so no


1202
00:35:58,226 --> 00:35:59,376
additional fields are required.


1203
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:01,846
However, if I wasn't, this would


1204
00:36:01,846 --> 00:36:03,166
be a really great place for you


1205
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:04,426
to request the minimal


1206
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:05,856
information to make collection


1207
00:36:05,856 --> 00:36:06,656
of the items easier.


1208
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:09,916
Finally, a confirmation to let


1209
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:11,186
me know that the order's been


1210
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:12,496
done, and I should wait for a


1211
00:36:12,496 --> 00:36:13,136
notification.


1212
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,156
As I walk over to the pizza


1213
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:16,666
station, the notification


1214
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,156
arrives to let me know that it's


1215
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:18,386
ready.


1216
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:21,596
And, when I get there, my lunch


1217
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,236
is waiting for me.


1218
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:24,016
A ticket with my name on it, and


1219
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,896
a member of the Caffe Macs staff


1220
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,246
confirms me by name, and I'm


1221
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:29,186
away to devour my pizza.


1222
00:36:30,386 --> 00:36:31,656
Now, that's a great experience


1223
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,886
from start to finish.


1224
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:35,346
And, another experience that we


1225
00:36:35,346 --> 00:36:38,226
love is a food ordering app from


1226
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:38,756
China, [Chinese spoken].


1227
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:42,886
Now, they start with using the


1228
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:44,026
iPhone's camera to scan a QR


1229
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:45,016
code when entering the


1230
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:45,446
restaurant.


1231
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:46,946
And, that takes them straight to


1232
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:49,086
the menu in the [Chinese spoken]


1233
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:50,386
app.


1234
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:52,286
They use images in their menu to


1235
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:53,566
make it easy to know what you


1236
00:36:53,566 --> 00:36:55,446
want, and how to checkout fast.


1237
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:00,116
In the checkout flow, the app


1238
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:01,646
offers the user a virtual


1239
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:04,516
payment credential, issued by


1240
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:05,386
[Chinese spoken], which uses our


1241
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:06,666
in app provisioning flow to put


1242
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,106
a card directly into Wallet.


1243
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,466
Now, this works great even if


1244
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:12,366
the user has no cards at all, in


1245
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:13,326
Wallet or otherwise.


1246
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:15,866
They can set one up, and order


1247
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,396
right away.


1248
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:18,706
And, the card that's provisioned


1249
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:20,936
can be used in all e-commerce,


1250
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:22,616
and in-store merchants anywhere


1251
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,726
in China that takes Apple Pay.


1252
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:26,946
If you use a provisions


1253
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:27,686
[inaudible] card into Wallet,


1254
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:29,646
Apple Pay's the exclusive option


1255
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:30,256
to checkout.


1256
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:32,266
Fantastic example of defaulting.


1257
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:36,356
As soon as I Face ID, the food


1258
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:36,736
is ordered.


1259
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,796
That's a fantastic experience


1260
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:40,806
bringing together all of these


1261
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:43,476
technologies: GPS, beacons, the


1262
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:45,416
camera, in-app provisioning, and


1263
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,146
notifications.


1264
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:48,746
If you combine that with a great


1265
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,736
physical customer experience--


1266
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:52,816
you know, if you leverage


1267
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:53,686
everything we've shown you here


1268
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:55,586
today, you too can build digital


1269
00:37:55,586 --> 00:37:56,496
to physical commerce


1270
00:37:56,496 --> 00:37:57,096
experiences.


1271
00:37:58,136 --> 00:37:59,596
So, I have one piece of final


1272
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:00,126
housekeeping.


1273
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:02,826
If you are a payment processor,


1274
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:04,716
or a merchant, most of you don't


1275
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,296
need to worry, but you should


1276
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:07,736
just check your server-side


1277
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:08,836
certificate expiry dates in the


1278
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:09,426
developer portal.


1279
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:13,016
They are easy to renew, and you


1280
00:38:13,016 --> 00:38:15,136
should renew before expiry to


1281
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:16,566
avoid disruption taking Apple


1282
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:17,316
Pay.


1283
00:38:18,036 --> 00:38:19,256
That's everything we have to


1284
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:19,936
talk about today.


1285
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:21,686
If you want to learn more, our


1286
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,676
online documentation can be


1287
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,186
found here.


1288
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:25,846
And, if you have any questions


1289
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,366
about Wallet, Apple Pay, or Core


1290
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:29,386
NFC, you can join us immediately


1291
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:30,966
after this session in Technology


1292
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,326
Lab 1 at 10 A.M. Thank you all


1293
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:34,386
for coming today, and I hope


1294
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:35,366
you've had a great WWDC.


1295
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:35,556
Bye.
