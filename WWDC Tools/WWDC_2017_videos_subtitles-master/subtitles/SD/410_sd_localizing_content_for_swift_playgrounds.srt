[ Applause ]


2
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:23,766
>> Good afternoon and welcome to


3
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,246
Localizing Content for Swift


4
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:25,956
Playgrounds.


5
00:00:26,316 --> 00:00:27,356
I am Alex Kuhn.


6
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:28,806
I'm an engineer on the Content


7
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:29,886
team, developing content for


8
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:31,366
Swift Playgrounds, and I'll be


9
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:32,695
joined later by Aaltan Ahmad


10
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:33,926
from the Internationalization


11
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:34,206
Team.


12
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:37,686
Now it's a big world out there


13
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,646
full of many different diverse


14
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:40,836
people that would love to use


15
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:42,276
the amazing content that you


16
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:43,846
build in Swift Playgrounds.


17
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:46,536
However, at Swift Playgrounds,


18
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:47,816
right now we have over a million


19
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:48,416
users.


20
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,166
Except nearly two-thirds of them


21
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,186
are outside the US.


22
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:52,736
So for them to be able to use


23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,376
your amazing content you need to


24
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,226
localize it to hit this whole


25
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:58,066
world, is what we'll talk about


26
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:58,366
today.


27
00:00:58,946 --> 00:01:01,146
So a little bit of history on


28
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:02,056
Swift Playgrounds.


29
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:04,206
This is an iPad app that enables


30
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:06,016
you to write Swift code and see


31
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,516
the results of it executed live.


32
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:09,866
And along with Swift Playgrounds


33
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:11,256
we've released a curriculum


34
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:12,986
teaching a beginner the basics


35
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:13,876
of learning the code.


36
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:16,216
And also, there is different


37
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:17,906
coding challenges such as


38
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:19,356
writing the logic for the game


39
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:19,956
of Battleship.


40
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,956
Now this was initially released


41
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:25,996
in English, but we have since


42
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,726
translated that into five


43
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:28,896
additional languages.


44
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:30,966
Spanish. French.


45
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:33,786
German. Simplified Chinese and


46
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:34,476
Japanese.


47
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:36,306
And we have more coming soon.


48
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,226
And in localizing the content,


49
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:40,586
we had a number of different


50
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,486
challenges and issues that we


51
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:43,536
had to encounter and work


52
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,366
through in order to have a great


53
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,926
experience for our users.


54
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:48,766
And so this is what we want to


55
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,966
talk about some of the lessons


56
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,176
learned for you, when you make


57
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:52,886
your own content.


58
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:55,086
So today we'll give an overview


59
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:56,736
of what is content and Swift


60
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,946
Playgrounds and some of the


61
00:01:57,946 --> 00:01:58,816
challenges around it.


62
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:00,726
And we'll talk through some of


63
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:02,336
the localization considerations


64
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:03,906
when you are making your own


65
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,076
content and localizing it.


66
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,866
And lastly, we'll go through


67
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:08,985
what is the structure of a


68
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,386
localized Playground book so


69
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:11,826
that you can make your books


70
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:12,916
localizable today.


71
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,956
Now before we begin talking


72
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:18,486
about localization, it's


73
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:19,976
something that's really critical


74
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,276
is to define your content goals.


75
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,426
And this is important because


76
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:25,376
when you build the content


77
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:26,876
initially, when it goes to


78
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,226
localization, you need to be


79
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:29,646
able to tell someone else what


80
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:31,176
exactly your goals were, and


81
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,476
what do you want the experience


82
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:34,226
for that user to be like in any


83
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,726
language, since it's not going


84
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,496
to be you necessarily doing all


85
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:38,446
of the translations.


86
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,956
So to give an example of the


87
00:02:41,956 --> 00:02:44,336
content goals we had and learned


88
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,166
at code.


89
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:48,856
For one, it was instructional.


90
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:50,126
We're trying to teach the


91
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,926
beginner the basics of coding in


92
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,766
Swift, assuming no prior


93
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:54,366
knowledge.


94
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,766
However, we also want it to be


95
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,756
fun and engaging.


96
00:02:58,226 --> 00:02:59,156
It shouldn't be like a dry


97
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,656
textbook, but rather something


98
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,756
the user wants to use and is


99
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:04,206
engaged with coding and learning


100
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:04,636
more.


101
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,826
And we chose to target the ages


102
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:08,606
of 12 and up.


103
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,616
So whether you're 12 or 112,


104
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:12,876
we'd love for you to have a


105
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,436
great experience using our


106
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:14,896
content.


107
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:17,806
Now just to get an overview of


108
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,296
what this translates to and


109
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,076
learn the code, here you see


110
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,476
this page is about learning


111
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:24,046
about debugging and finding and


112
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:24,846
fixing bugs.


113
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,626
Something I'm sure many of you


114
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,666
are quite familiar with.


115
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,676
However, to a learner this is


116
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,526
the first time they're being


117
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:31,686
introduced to the concept.


118
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,176
Now on the right here we have a


119
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:34,866
live view.


120
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,536
In this case it's a 3D animated


121
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:39,166
puzzle world where you're trying


122
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,446
to write code to solve different


123
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:41,716
puzzles and collect gems.


124
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,926
There's also a prose area that


125
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:46,476
provides instructional content


126
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,166
and the goals on a page and the


127
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,126
tasks a learner needs to


128
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:49,616
perform.


129
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,716
And then, of course, the coding


130
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:53,856
area where they can write and


131
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:55,226
edit Swift code to solve the


132
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:55,606
puzzle.


133
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,336
So going back to those goals,


134
00:03:58,876 --> 00:03:59,556
one of ours is to be


135
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,316
instructional.


136
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:02,346
So we are actually defining what


137
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,016
the term "bug" and "debugging"


138
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:05,306
means to a learner who might


139
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:06,326
never have experienced this


140
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:06,796
before.


141
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:07,906
And this is something that needs


142
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:08,896
to be kept into mind with


143
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,596
localization which I'll tie back


144
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:11,076
to later.


145
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:12,756
And throughout the course of the


146
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:14,466
curriculum, there are many such


147
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,616
definitions that occur


148
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:16,446
gradually.


149
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,956
And in the end, there's a whole


150
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:20,176
glossary of terms that the


151
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,926
learner gets exposed to when


152
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:22,926
they go through the curriculum


153
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:24,336
that has gradually built up to,


154
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:25,846
and this needs to be taken into


155
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,786
account when you localize it.


156
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:30,716
Now one other feature in the


157
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,546
system is that when the learner


158
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:34,536
runs their code, the system is


159
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:36,216
analyzing what the learner has


160
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:37,586
done and is trying to help


161
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,026
provide corrective feedback.


162
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,396
Trying to give him instruction


163
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:41,596
of how to improve or fix what


164
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:41,976
they did.


165
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,976
So here you'll see that animated


166
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:45,396
character, Byte, failed to


167
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:46,166
collect the gem.


168
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,176
And the learner tapped on the


169
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,606
hint saying, "Did you notice


170
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:50,216
that bug?


171
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:51,576
Byte tried to collect a gem that


172
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:52,246
wasn't there."


173
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,226
So here we're taking a


174
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:56,026
conversational tone trying to be


175
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:56,896
a little bit more fun and


176
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,776
engaging, while at the same time


177
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,266
giving instructional feedback


178
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:01,546
saying that they need to use


179
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,666
collect gem, the function, when


180
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,336
they're under a particular gem.


181
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,136
So when this page is put into


182
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:10,966
Chinese, you'll notice that


183
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,096
while the code is in English


184
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,986
everything else is localized.


185
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,076
And we're still teaching these


186
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,916
exact same concepts, but in a


187
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,446
way that is appropriate to the


188
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:19,096
language.


189
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:20,306
So they're still learning about


190
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,466
bugs and debugging, but they


191
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:22,756
need to be able to relate it


192
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,266
back to the code that they're


193
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,306
seeing on the page.


194
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:29,216
And similarly, those hints -- we


195
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:30,566
want to maintain that similar


196
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,426
style, but you'll notice that


197
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:33,896
we're referencing to the collect


198
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:35,626
gem command in English.


199
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,936
So this is one of the things


200
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:37,956
that challenges around


201
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:39,846
localization of dealing with


202
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:40,716
these various different


203
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,886
technical terms as well as code


204
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:44,286
in English that we'll talk more


205
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:44,866
about later.


206
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,406
Now one other feature in Swift


207
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:50,976
Playgrounds is we use animated


208
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,406
cut scenes to introduce a


209
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:54,536
concept at high level before the


210
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:55,796
learner dives into coding.


211
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:57,866
So in this case, learner is


212
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:58,656
learning about what an "if


213
00:05:58,656 --> 00:05:59,786
statement" is before they


214
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:00,686
proceed to use it.


215
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,706
And when this is localized, the


216
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:06,056
localization has to take into


217
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:08,126
account how helping the learner


218
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:09,336
to actually do the task.


219
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,846
So we're still mentioning if


220
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,146
statement -- the if command in


221
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:15,426
English, even though everything


222
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:17,116
else is in Chinese because


223
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:17,936
that's how they're going to need


224
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:19,316
to solve the puzzles later when


225
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:20,136
they write Swift Code.


226
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:23,456
So that's a little overview of


227
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:23,906
the content.


228
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:25,626
But I'm just going to step back


229
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:26,576
a moment and talk about the


230
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,106
process of building localized


231
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:28,506
content.


232
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:31,366
And a common approach that many


233
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,746
people might take is that you


234
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:35,286
define your goals and you build


235
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:36,936
up the content in one language;


236
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:38,346
testing and iterating it.


237
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:39,946
Testing it with your users and


238
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:40,726
making sure you have a great


239
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:41,496
experience.


240
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:42,826
Then you decide you want to


241
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:43,496
localize it.


242
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:44,896
So then you send it off to your


243
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:47,286
translators and localize it and


244
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:48,646
then you get it back and ship


245
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:48,786
it.


246
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:49,896
You're done, right?


247
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,906
Unfortunately, this has many


248
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:53,506
problems.


249
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,046
You may find when you send it


250
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:56,306
off to be translated that your


251
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:57,926
content isn't localizable.


252
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,496
Or that there are different


253
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:02,176
issues in the translation, and


254
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:03,336
it's not actually hitting the


255
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,026
goals you're seeking at the same


256
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:05,866
level as when you first


257
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,676
developed it in one language.


258
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,716
So what is the better approach?


259
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:14,726
Well, for one, localization is


260
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,146
part of the design process.


261
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:17,866
You should be thinking about


262
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,156
localization when you are


263
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:20,696
designing out your content goals


264
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:21,666
and the initial design of the


265
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,426
product in order to avoid costly


266
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,666
mistakes later that prevent


267
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,286
content from being localized.


268
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,396
And this is no different than


269
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,036
what you should do with


270
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:31,866
accessibility.


271
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,726
Thinking about it during the


272
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,066
design process instead of


273
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:35,866
afterwards.


274
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:37,276
Which is what enables you to


275
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:38,276
make it a really amazing


276
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:38,746
product.


277
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,966
So a better way to think about


278
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,316
this diagram, is -- the process


279
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:46,676
is to define your goals and


280
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,346
design out the content thinking


281
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,376
about localization.


282
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,346
And then when you send it off to


283
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,826
be localized, you make sure that


284
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:54,966
your translators really


285
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,196
understand your goals and what


286
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:59,136
your content is, so that they


287
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:00,716
can translate it appropriately


288
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,196
for each language to


289
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,886
consistently hit those goals.


290
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:05,716
And this may take several rounds


291
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:07,136
of iteration when you translate


292
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:07,276
it.


293
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,236
So during this time it's really


294
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,726
critical to test with actual


295
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,616
users, as they're the ones who


296
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,006
you're trying to serve and they


297
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:14,976
can tell you if you're doing it


298
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,196
right or wrong or if it's


299
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,346
actually meeting their needs and


300
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:18,026
understandable.


301
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:20,776
And of course, during this


302
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,576
process you may find you need to


303
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:23,896
go back and adapt your original


304
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,686
content due to some issues you


305
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:26,916
found that prevent it from being


306
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:27,826
localized fully.


307
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:29,636
But hopefully because you've


308
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:30,356
considered this in the


309
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:31,806
beginning, these changes are


310
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:32,716
relatively minor.


311
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,956
So this is a much better


312
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,256
approach to taking and thinking


313
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:37,256
about building localized


314
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:37,756
content.


315
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:40,666
Now I'll hand it over to Aaltan


316
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,746
to talk about localization


317
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:42,576
considerations.


318
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:43,946
>> Thank you Alex.


319
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,226
So today I'm going to talk to


320
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,916
you about the process that we


321
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:50,336
went through when we localized


322
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,236
Swift Playgrounds, and some of


323
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:53,666
the key areas that you should be


324
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,006
thinking about when you are


325
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:55,976
localizing your own Swift


326
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:56,556
Playgrounds.


327
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:59,996
So let's go back to that diagram


328
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,156
that Alex introduced to you and


329
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,516
let's talk first about the


330
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:06,406
process of actually adapting our


331
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:09,296
own content and goals while


332
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:10,596
thinking about localization to


333
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:12,146
begin with before we even start


334
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:13,106
the actual process of


335
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:13,706
translation.


336
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,076
and the important thing to


337
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,376
remember here is that your


338
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:19,156
content choices affect your


339
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,406
localizability of your


340
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:20,986
playground.


341
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,546
So, for example, if you have a


342
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:24,836
storyline running through your


343
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:27,246
prose, or a particular style of


344
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:29,216
writing that involves wordplay


345
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:31,116
or puns, this is something that


346
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,126
is really important to


347
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,306
communicate to the people who


348
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,086
are actually translating your


349
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,236
playground, so that they can


350
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:37,576
maintain that feeling in their


351
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,316
own languages.


352
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,306
Additionally, there may -- the


353
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:42,446
concepts that you are trying to


354
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:43,756
teach may be tied to a


355
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,046
particular language in the first


356
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:45,476
place.


357
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:47,176
And so you're going to need to


358
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:49,356
think about adapting these for


359
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:50,996
localization.


360
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,036
And we can take the example of


361
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,846
Cipher, which is a playground


362
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,206
that we developed where we try


363
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:59,176
to teach the learner about coded


364
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:02,506
messages and encryption through


365
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:04,616
a very story-like setting where


366
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,236
their place is a detective and


367
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:07,506
follow clues to solve the


368
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:07,976
mystery.


369
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:09,696
So here their adding style is


370
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,366
actually kind of unique where we


371
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,776
really place the reader in the


372
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:15,446
setting of the storyline.


373
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:17,276
So here we say, "The library is


374
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:18,016
warm and quiet.


375
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,076
A welcome relief from the


376
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,506
howling snowstorm outside."


377
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,386
And this will be something that


378
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:23,416
you want to communicate to


379
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,446
translators so that they can


380
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:26,056
maintain that same narrative


381
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,196
feel, otherwise that friendly,


382
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:30,976
playful feeling might get lost.


383
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:34,776
Another part about Cipher is the


384
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:35,416
clues.


385
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:38,526
So we have a clue where often


386
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,386
you can bring one of the coded


387
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,576
messages, the learner is told to


388
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,516
look to N for the answer to the


389
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:45,536
next challenges.


390
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:47,516
And we actually call this out in


391
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,776
the prose as well, where we say


392
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:50,116
the message says, "look to N."


393
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:51,586
Who or what is N?


394
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:54,656
And right here you can see that


395
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:55,896
there's an interesting challenge


396
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,086
with the letter N itself.


397
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,866
Different languages have


398
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,206
different alphabets, and some


399
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:02,546
languages may not even have the


400
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:03,636
letter N in their alphabet.


401
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:04,996
And so this is something you'll


402
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:05,726
want to consider.


403
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,786
If the letter N is particularly


404
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:10,146
tied to your challenge or


405
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,876
finding clues or investigating


406
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,916
certain things in the puzzle,


407
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:15,246
that might be a problem down the


408
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:16,596
road for localizability.


409
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,416
So you want to give translators


410
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,216
the freedom to take this letter


411
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,456
N and actually adapt it to what


412
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:23,576
feels most comfortable and


413
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:27,256
natural for their language.


414
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,626
So in Cipher we actually try to


415
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,026
teach the learner about


416
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,246
encryption.


417
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:35,206
And we do this through a simple


418
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:36,386
substitution cipher.


419
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,196
And in a substitution cipher you


420
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,006
take your alphabet and you shift


421
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:41,466
it by a certain number of


422
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,376
letters to create a new mapping.


423
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,246
And using that mapping you can


424
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,106
take a plain text word like


425
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,746
Cipher and encrypt it so it


426
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:51,106
can't be deciphered without the


427
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:51,596
right key.


428
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:54,496
And This works great in English.


429
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:56,106
But when you translate your


430
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,676
playground and hand it to


431
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,036
someone who's a Spanish speaker,


432
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:00,946
probably they're going to end up


433
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:03,206
typing a letter enye, which was


434
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:04,546
not in your original alphabet.


435
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,846
And if you hadn't thought about


436
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:08,266
this beforehand, you're going to


437
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,606
be in a situation where maybe a


438
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:10,996
learner can't solve the next


439
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:12,946
step of the puzzle, or decrypt


440
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:14,386
the particular message because


441
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:15,116
it doesn't work in their


442
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:15,586
language.


443
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:17,576
So really, these are the kinds


444
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:18,486
of things you want to look out


445
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:19,456
for when you're planning your


446
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:20,476
content and your puzzles.


447
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:24,746
Another strategy you can take


448
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,036
when planning out your content


449
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:28,756
is to actually make it language


450
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:29,926
agnostic to begin with.


451
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,976
So if you plan it out in a way


452
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:34,166
that doesn't -- is not


453
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,336
particularly tied to any


454
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,846
particular language or culture,


455
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:39,446
you can avoid that problem to


456
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:39,986
begin with.


457
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,536
And that's exactly what we did


458
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:43,296
with Learn to Code.


459
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,036
We have a made up character,


460
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,526
Byte, in a made up world, that


461
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:47,436
is free from any kind of


462
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,546
cultural or linguistic ties.


463
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,916
So the translation and


464
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,336
localization process becomes a


465
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,816
lot easier because this puzzle


466
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,976
is pretty much the same, no


467
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:56,956
matter what language it's


468
00:12:56,956 --> 00:12:57,336
running in.


469
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:59,176
Collecting a gem is collecting a


470
00:12:59,176 --> 00:12:59,496
gem.


471
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:01,496
Whether it's in English or in


472
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:02,016
Spanish.


473
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,606
So that's another strategy you


474
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:07,596
can use.


475
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:11,376
Once you've actually planned out


476
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:12,496
your goals and your content, and


477
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:13,596
you feel like you're in a good


478
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:15,726
place with localization and


479
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:16,656
you're ready to actually


480
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:19,156
translate, there are a few key


481
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,526
areas that you should keep in


482
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:22,096
mind when doing this.


483
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:23,606
So let's talk about the actual


484
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:24,736
translation process.


485
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:27,566
The first important thing to


486
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,636
consider is your audience.


487
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,536
So different languages have


488
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,946
different levels of formality.


489
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,986
In English you are you, no


490
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:38,276
matter what the context.


491
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,926
We don't make any distinction


492
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,176
between addressing someone using


493
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:42,796
the word, "you".


494
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,506
However, most languages other


495
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,876
than English actually do make a


496
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,416
distinction here such as German


497
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,036
and French.


498
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,766
You can see in German, in an


499
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,236
informal context you would refer


500
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,146
to someone as du.


501
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:55,196
And in informal context, you


502
00:13:55,196 --> 00:13:56,796
would refer to someone as Sie.


503
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,266
and same for French.


504
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:01,316
And an important thing to note


505
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:02,996
about these languages is that


506
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:05,086
children's texts here are


507
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,666
actually written in the informal


508
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,096
voice.


509
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,456
And this goes a long way to


510
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:11,206
creating a kind of informal,


511
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:12,906
comfortable feeling for the


512
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:14,116
children.


513
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:15,856
And if you're targeting your


514
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,326
Swift Playground to a younger


515
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:20,696
audience as we were, using the


516
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,316
informal voice is going to be a


517
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:23,996
key piece in making this feel


518
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,556
comfortable to them, and like


519
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:26,666
something they're already used


520
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,346
to reading with from school.


521
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:31,376
There's an important distinction


522
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:32,756
here to be made between the


523
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,156
formal and informal voice.


524
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:36,926
Because in iOS, for alerts or


525
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,626
other messages we actually use


526
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,346
the formal tone.


527
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,796
This is because it's more


528
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,676
appropriate when your phone or


529
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,116
computer is delivering you a


530
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,326
message in a matter-of-fact way,


531
00:14:47,816 --> 00:14:49,556
to have a formal tone of voice.


532
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,496
And of course this contrasts


533
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:52,546
with Swift Playgrounds.


534
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:55,316
So this is an important factor


535
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:56,596
to consider, depending on the


536
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,806
age you're targeting.


537
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:00,736
Another part of your audience is


538
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:02,026
going to be how old they are.


539
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,356
And Japanese gives us a good


540
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,426
example to understand this


541
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:08,286
distinction between older and


542
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,126
younger readers.


543
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,736
So Japanese uses three different


544
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:12,966
writing systems, and one of


545
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:14,586
those writing systems is called


546
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:15,086
Kan ji.


547
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,536
And Kan ji is a pictographical


548
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:19,066
alphabet that has thousands of


549
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:19,716
characters.


550
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,566
And the point here is that


551
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,606
children learn these characters


552
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:26,006
as they grow older, and a


553
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:27,336
younger person is going to be


554
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,746
familiar with less Kan ji than


555
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:30,926
an older person.


556
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:32,426
And they're going to be familiar


557
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,046
with simpler Kan ji rather than


558
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,066
more complex ones.


559
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:37,876
So how does this factor into


560
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:38,856
sort of playgrounds?


561
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:40,756
let's take the example of the


562
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,046
term, "Code area" which we use


563
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:44,316
to refer to the code editor


564
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:45,616
where you can input your Swift.


565
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:48,356
If you handed this off to a


566
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,956
translator without any prior


567
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,256
explanation, or instructions


568
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:53,636
about what age you're trying to


569
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,126
target, they might choose a


570
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,796
standard Japanese translation of


571
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,186
this, which sort of roughly


572
00:15:58,186 --> 00:15:59,616
sounds like code sphere or


573
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:00,216
territory.


574
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:04,076
However, when you inform them


575
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,446
about these goals and the


576
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,366
younger audience that you're


577
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,266
targeting, a better translation


578
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:09,666
comes out, which is a place to


579
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,256
write code.


580
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:11,656
And there's a couple of


581
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:12,736
important points that I want to


582
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:13,866
highlight between these two


583
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:14,666
translations.


584
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:16,166
The first is the usage of the


585
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,426
word "place" versus "fear" or


586
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:19,036
"territory".


587
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:22,836
Place is a very common Kan ji,


588
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,276
and so a younger reader is much


589
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,526
more likely to be able to -- to


590
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:28,336
be familiar with this -- with


591
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:28,966
these words.


592
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,036
Additionally, we also chose to


593
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,386
include the verb for, "to


594
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:32,716
write".


595
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,776
To really make it explicit what


596
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,316
the purpose of this area or


597
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:37,276
place is.


598
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:39,906
So that can go a long way in


599
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,166
making your Playgrounds easy to


600
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:41,726
understand.


601
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:45,716
Technical terms are another area


602
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:46,976
where you should pay a lot of


603
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:48,926
attention when writing and


604
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:49,806
translating your Swift


605
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:50,306
Playgrounds.


606
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:52,036
So these can include computer


607
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,296
science terms, math terms, and


608
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:57,866
of course, the Swift language


609
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:00,386
keyword, enums, functions and


610
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,316
other code that you include in


611
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:03,016
your prose.


612
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:05,226
And to understand this, let's


613
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:06,776
look at the example that Alex


614
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,246
mentioned earlier about


615
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,886
introducing debugging.


616
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:11,756
And in order to introduce


617
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:13,526
debugging, we have to introduce


618
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:14,796
the concept of a bug.


619
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:18,116
And in English, we have a simple


620
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,346
phrase here that says, "A


621
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:20,746
mistake that keeps your program


622
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,596
from running correctly is called


623
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:22,925
a bug."


624
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:24,856
And the highlight here is on the


625
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:26,656
term bug, because that's what


626
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:27,386
we're going to take and


627
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:28,756
translate into our various


628
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,846
languages.


629
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:34,976
So in French we discovered that


630
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:36,756
while learning programming in


631
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,076
French, the word bug is actually


632
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:40,216
left untranslated.


633
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,306
And that is the standard for


634
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,676
learning how to program.


635
00:17:45,256 --> 00:17:47,996
So this is, you know, what feels


636
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:49,526
most natural and comfortable to


637
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,686
a speaker of French, and what's


638
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:51,646
most appropriate for the


639
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:52,166
context.


640
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:53,956
And so in this case, actually


641
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:55,596
not translating that word and


642
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,416
leaving it in English was the


643
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,796
most appropriate choice.


644
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,556
However, for a language like


645
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,546
Spanish, using a native term,


646
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:07,086
"error" was through our research


647
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,476
and understanding, a more


648
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:09,516
appropriate choice here.


649
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:11,176
And an interesting fact about


650
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,436
the Spanish translation is that


651
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:13,626
in parentheses, we actually


652
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,846
point out that in English, the


653
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,846
word "error" is called, "bug".


654
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,566
And this allows the learner to


655
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:22,476
sort of see that term -- see the


656
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,826
term bug outside a Swift


657
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:25,256
Playground, perhaps, and


658
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:26,556
actually be able to relate it


659
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,366
back to what they learned in


660
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,206
Swift Playgrounds.


661
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:32,676
So that's terms that you


662
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:34,346
actually have a freedom to


663
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:34,906
translate.


664
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:36,266
But what about terms that you


665
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,546
can't translate like code?


666
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:40,016
Here we have the example of the


667
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,056
function moveForward in the


668
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:43,306
Japanese version of Swift


669
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:43,926
Playgrounds.


670
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,956
And we needed to mention this


671
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:48,076
function in the prose to sort of


672
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,516
explain certain concepts.


673
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,576
And Japanese is an interesting


674
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:52,536
language because it has a


675
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,116
relatively low tolerance for


676
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,536
English words being introduced


677
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,326
into the language.


678
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,996
So it's important that we call


679
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:02,876
out the simple explanation for


680
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:04,986
this function moveForward, or


681
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:07,416
susumo or move in Japanese, in


682
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,466
parentheses following the


683
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:10,556
occurrence of the function name.


684
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:11,936
And this really helps the


685
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,526
learner draw a parallel between


686
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:15,516
the English term and the


687
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,106
Japanese term so that they can


688
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:18,816
sort of internalize the meaning


689
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:19,146
of it.


690
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:21,306
And another interesting thing


691
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:22,936
about Japanese is because of


692
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:25,426
this familiarity with English,


693
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:26,996
or lack of familiarity with


694
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:28,956
English, we make it a point to


695
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,846
mention these parenthesized


696
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,356
explanations for function names


697
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:35,446
and other variables throughout


698
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,886
the entire prose instead of


699
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,396
mentioning them when the term is


700
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:41,186
introduced and then phasing them


701
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:41,426
out.


702
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:43,526
And that's a strategy that


703
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:45,056
varies per language because


704
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:47,196
different language are familiar


705
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,236
differently with English.


706
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:50,486
So it's another important thing


707
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:51,006
to consider.


708
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:54,526
Your translators will also have


709
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,976
a lot of editorial freedom when


710
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:57,396
translating Swift Playgrounds.


711
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:00,686
So here we are introducing and


712
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:03,366
learn to code three, the concept


713
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:05,226
of a quadrant and the fact that


714
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:07,056
the learner can place different


715
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,106
objects at a different


716
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,466
coordinate in the space.


717
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,276
And to do this, of course we


718
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,316
need to talk about the term


719
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:12,826
quadrant.


720
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:15,766
So in English, we introduce the


721
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,486
term quadrant by relating it to


722
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,246
quarters.


723
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,006
And there is a nice alliteration


724
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:22,666
here, and that makes it a little


725
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,596
bit easier for the term to get


726
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:25,246
introduced.


727
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:27,446
However, in Japanese we don't


728
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,996
have the advantage of having


729
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,176
this alliteration.


730
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:32,726
And so the translator here


731
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:35,306
adopted a different strategy to


732
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:37,806
use a simple word for area or


733
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:39,796
[inaudible] outside parentheses.


734
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:42,036
And then inside parentheses, use


735
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:43,606
the more technical; complicated


736
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:46,776
term or shogan for quadrant.


737
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:49,076
The English translations there


738
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,606
are for your reference below.


739
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:52,606
So the translator -- an


740
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:53,976
important thing to note here is


741
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,176
that the translator didn't stick


742
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:57,336
verbatim to what was in English.


743
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,536
Which might be the default case


744
00:20:59,536 --> 00:21:00,626
if you didn't give them any


745
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,216
instructions.


746
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,756
They might try to stick very


747
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:04,076
closely to the English text.


748
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:06,266
So it's important to let them


749
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,036
know that they have the freedom


750
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:09,776
to do what is most appropriate


751
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,606
and most comfortable for their


752
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:12,236
own language.


753
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:16,076
Additionally, because Swift


754
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,726
Playgrounds prose is written in


755
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,376
a variant of Markdown, they


756
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:20,836
actually have the freedom to add


757
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,726
extra formatting, bold or


758
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,466
italic, or even extra glossary


759
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:27,056
links to their particular


760
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,986
language if they deem that to be


761
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:29,716
appropriate.


762
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,226
So when thinking about technical


763
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,396
terms, it's important to keep in


764
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,526
mind that unfamiliar terms are


765
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:39,356
confusing, and you should be


766
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:40,906
aware of that when using them in


767
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:42,666
your prose.


768
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,656
Different languages have


769
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:44,926
different levels of comfort with


770
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:45,346
English.


771
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,486
So what works for one language


772
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:48,906
will not always work for


773
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:49,246
another.


774
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,196
And lastly, consistency is


775
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:53,506
really, really important here.


776
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:55,566
Especially because we're dealing


777
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,616
with terms that might be from a


778
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,896
foreign language or might be


779
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:58,876
highly technical.


780
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:00,456
It's important to maintain a


781
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,746
consistent usage of those terms


782
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:04,476
throughout your prose so that a


783
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:06,026
person can get more familiar


784
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,126
with them.


785
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,816
So we looked at a lot of


786
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:13,376
examples of different


787
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:15,626
localization strategies and


788
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,136
different localization pitfalls


789
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,076
and Swift Playgrounds, and


790
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,126
there's a few things that I want


791
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:20,206
you to take away from this.


792
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:23,496
Firstly, your content goals and


793
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:24,756
your audience are really going


794
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:26,066
to influence your localization


795
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:27,856
here, perhaps even more so than


796
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,166
a standard iOS application.


797
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,406
So it's really important to plan


798
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:33,916
those out with localization in


799
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:34,956
mind beforehand.


800
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,376
Different languages have


801
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:39,356
different language features, and


802
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:41,366
your translators are going to


803
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,626
need to have the freedom to do


804
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,446
what's most appropriate for


805
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:46,666
their particular language.


806
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:49,996
Maintaining a style guide or


807
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:52,046
some kind of document for your


808
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:53,596
translation process is going to


809
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:55,026
be really helpful for you here.


810
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:58,076
Both in, you know, explaining to


811
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,326
your translators how -- what


812
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:01,266
your goals are; what your


813
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:02,796
content goals are and how you


814
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,306
want the translations to sound


815
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,966
and feel, as well as any


816
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:07,226
language-specific issues that


817
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:08,176
they may encounter and


818
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:09,596
strategies they want to -- may


819
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,136
want to develop to maintain


820
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,696
consistency throughout your


821
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:13,796
translations.


822
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:17,566
And user testing is really your


823
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:18,186
friend here.


824
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,616
It might be resource intensive


825
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,136
and difficult to find people


826
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,206
that you are targeting with your


827
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,806
playgrounds, but the effort


828
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:26,236
really, really pays off here.


829
00:23:26,516 --> 00:23:28,356
Because your users of your


830
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:29,876
target are the audience are the


831
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,146
only people who can really tell


832
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:32,976
you how effective your


833
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,426
playground is being at teaching


834
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:35,826
them these concepts.


835
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:40,186
So lastly, I'd like to bring you


836
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:43,186
back to this picture of


837
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:44,736
localization and kind of the


838
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:46,986
holistic idea here where your


839
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:48,916
goals -- your original goals and


840
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,326
the localized content are not


841
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:52,016
really separate entities that


842
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:53,526
feedback into each other and


843
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:54,926
really influence each others


844
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:55,526
development.


845
00:23:56,056 --> 00:23:57,866
It's really important to keep


846
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,856
this in mind when you're taking


847
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,586
your content from English or


848
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:03,416
whatever you're -- the language


849
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,456
that you wrote it in is into


850
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:07,736
translated Playgrounds.


851
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,306
Because localization is so often


852
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,296
overlooked as a part of software


853
00:24:12,296 --> 00:24:14,566
development, you have no idea


854
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,966
how much users really appreciate


855
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,866
a well-localized, well-thought


856
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:19,546
out product.


857
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:21,566
And I'm confident that if you


858
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:23,156
try to follow these guidelines


859
00:24:23,156 --> 00:24:24,216
and stick to what we talked


860
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:25,956
about here, you'll really be


861
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,136
able to give people an amazing


862
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,266
experience in their native


863
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:28,696
language.


864
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:31,506
So with that I'll hand it back


865
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:33,846
to Alex, and he'll take you


866
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:35,656
through the process of actually


867
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:37,046
localizing your Playground book.


868
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:37,886
Thank you.


869
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:44,416
[ Applause ]


870
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,556
>> Thank you Aaltan.


871
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:47,566
So now we're going to dive into


872
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,076
some of the technical details to


873
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:50,436
make your book localizable.


874
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:52,496
And along with this talk there's


875
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,346
also sample code which you can


876
00:24:54,346 --> 00:24:55,536
explore in detail all of the


877
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,636
things we're talking about


878
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:57,076
today.


879
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:00,706
Now, this is a page in "Learn to


880
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:01,966
Code" that's expanded out to


881
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,416
show off all the different areas


882
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,376
that you have to worry about


883
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:05,366
when you localize.


884
00:25:06,446 --> 00:25:07,766
So on the right you'll see the


885
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,126
live view, but you can have


886
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,556
strings presented to the user.


887
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,646
In this case the audio controls.


888
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:15,956
There's also prose providing


889
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,156
instructional text.


890
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,706
The editable code area which is


891
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:22,916
a text that is displayed to the


892
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,666
user before they begin writing


893
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,696
codes to provide a prompt.


894
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:28,936
Each page can have a title.


895
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:31,916
Then also different glossary


896
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,726
terms which have definitions for


897
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:34,866
the learner to learn more about


898
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,906
if they forgot a term.


899
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:39,266
And a page can have one or more


900
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:40,816
hints if you want to provide


901
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:42,316
help for your learner as they're


902
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,336
going through and learning a


903
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:46,766
concept.


904
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,376
So these are all the different


905
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:49,876
parts we'll talk about showing


906
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,416
how to localize and what you


907
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,246
need to do for each of them.


908
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:54,256
And these come in a few


909
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,126
different types of files for


910
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:56,956
Playgrounds.


911
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:58,376
You might use a string in a


912
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:00,276
stringsdict file as well as an


913
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,326
xml plist.


914
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:03,846
And the cut scenes are written


915
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:04,606
in html.


916
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:06,656
And you may also have localized


917
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:07,226
assets.


918
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:08,486
So just do a change in each


919
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,546
image for each language to adapt


920
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:11,146
it.


921
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:13,926
Now one other detail before we


922
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:15,606
begin diving into the details is


923
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:16,866
understanding the overall


924
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,806
structure of a playground book.


925
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,336
So at a base level here, you see


926
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,766
you have a sources directory and


927
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,226
a private resources directory.


928
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:26,166
And the thing to note here is


929
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,326
that in the private resources


930
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:29,216
directory, you'll have an lproj


931
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,156
for each language you're


932
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:30,666
supporting.


933
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:32,266
In this example we're doing


934
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,706
English and Spanish, with


935
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:35,106
English being our development


936
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:35,536
language.


937
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:39,086
Then there is one or more


938
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,016
chapters in each book.


939
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,986
And each chapter has one or more


940
00:26:43,986 --> 00:26:44,466
pages.


941
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:46,096
And this is an example in one of


942
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:47,616
the pages in a book.


943
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,236
And again, the thing to note


944
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:50,556
here is that the private


945
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:52,156
resource directory has those


946
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:53,876
same lproj's for each language


947
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:54,536
you are supporting.


948
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,446
So what does this look like for


949
00:26:57,446 --> 00:26:58,126
each of the things?


950
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,166
Well, the strings that you have


951
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,996
in the live view, these you


952
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,616
should use in this localized


953
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:05,426
string for any time you are


954
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:06,846
using a string that will be


955
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:07,946
presented to the user.


956
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,836
And a thing to note here is that


957
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:12,316
it's not just things that


958
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:13,376
visually appear in the Live


959
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:15,036
View, but this also is important


960
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:16,016
for accessibility.


961
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:18,046
All of your accessibility labels


962
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,336
should use NSLocalizedString, so


963
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:21,806
that when someone is using the


964
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,026
accessibility features in


965
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:24,796
another language, they can get


966
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:26,466
the proper voiceover in their


967
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:27,456
language and have a great


968
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:28,646
experience with your content.


969
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:32,196
Now once you use


970
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,856
NSLocalizedString you would


971
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:35,326
extract this into the strings


972
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:36,766
file with a tool we made called


973
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:37,376
genstrings.


974
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:39,576
And there's more information on


975
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,016
the developers site of how to


976
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:42,986
use this tool and extract it.


977
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:46,516
And there was also a talk


978
00:27:46,856 --> 00:27:48,156
earlier this week on localizing


979
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:49,766
with Xcode 9 that goes through a


980
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:51,346
lot of general best practices


981
00:27:51,346 --> 00:27:54,306
with localizing in Xcode.


982
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,396
Now one key thing to note that


983
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:57,626
you might do in your playground


984
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:00,386
is using an image with text.


985
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:02,526
And it's really critical here to


986
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:04,256
not hardcode the text into the


987
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:06,126
image, as this will make it very


988
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:07,846
difficult to localize, requiring


989
00:28:07,846 --> 00:28:09,636
you to remake the image for each


990
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:10,176
language.


991
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:12,406
Instead, you can layer the text


992
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:14,566
on top of it to enable the


993
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:16,146
translator just to translate the


994
00:28:16,146 --> 00:28:17,956
strings and take advantage of


995
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:19,716
all of iOS's layout capabilities


996
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:21,716
to have a great experience for


997
00:28:23,956 --> 00:28:24,366
the learner.


998
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:26,396
Now once you have these files,


999
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:27,366
the string file will get


1000
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,256
extracted into the base level


1001
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:30,906
private resources folder in the


1002
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:31,336
project.


1003
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:33,986
And optionally for using a


1004
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:35,846
stringsdict file to dynamically


1005
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,226
reference a number, such as how


1006
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:38,336
many lines of code the learner


1007
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:39,766
has written, you would create a


1008
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:41,106
stringsdict file for that as


1009
00:28:41,106 --> 00:28:42,236
well in the same directory.


1010
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:47,206
So the next piece is the prose.


1011
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:50,206
And this is rendered in markups


1012
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:51,536
to the form of markdown.


1013
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:53,716
And this enables page level


1014
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:54,306
formatting.


1015
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,766
You can do bolding, italics, you


1016
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,946
can create glossary terms or


1017
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,116
link to another page in the


1018
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:00,416
book.


1019
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:03,106
And because of this, you have


1020
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:04,406
this different markup format


1021
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:05,506
that your translators will need


1022
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:07,046
to be aware of to take advantage


1023
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:07,236
of.


1024
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:09,826
So as Aaltan said, you want to


1025
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:11,046
tell all of your translators to


1026
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:13,606
have editorial freedom to adjust


1027
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:15,316
maybe the bolding or the style


1028
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:16,326
per language.


1029
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:17,576
And so they really need to


1030
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:19,206
understand the format in order


1031
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:20,196
to be able to do so.


1032
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,856
And it's also important that


1033
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,406
they be aware of what terms


1034
00:29:24,406 --> 00:29:26,186
cannot be translated that are


1035
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:28,066
actually part of the format so


1036
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,146
that they don't accidentally


1037
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,496
introduce errors in the code


1038
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:31,896
when they go to localize it.


1039
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:35,816
now how do you make your prose


1040
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,446
localizable?


1041
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:39,116
Well, you start a prose block by


1042
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:40,416
this little opening comment


1043
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,336
here, and then you add a


1044
00:29:42,336 --> 00:29:43,436
localized key.


1045
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:44,566
In this case we're calling it


1046
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:46,096
firstproseblock as a name for


1047
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:46,556
this key.


1048
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,056
This will enable it to be


1049
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:48,666
localized.


1050
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:51,686
And then in your lproj you'll


1051
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:53,656
create a prose.strings file and


1052
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:56,376
put that same key there and then


1053
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:57,996
set the value for whatever the


1054
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:58,826
markup that should be


1055
00:29:58,826 --> 00:29:59,896
substituted in for that


1056
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:00,596
language.


1057
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:05,856
And the contents.swift resides


1058
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:07,016
at the base directory for each


1059
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:07,566
page.


1060
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:10,076
But the prose.strings file will


1061
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:12,056
be in the private resources for


1062
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:12,666
each language that you're


1063
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:12,956
supporting.


1064
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:20,626
Next is the editable text field


1065
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:21,406
placeholders.


1066
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,046
So these are another strings


1067
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:24,456
file.


1068
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,846
And you see here the tap to


1069
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:26,506
tenter code.


1070
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:28,726
So how this is defined in the


1071
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,376
initial language is just in a


1072
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:31,176
code comment.


1073
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:32,576
Where you see in the


1074
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:34,166
contents.swift tap to enter


1075
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:34,516
code.


1076
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:38,086
And for this to be localizable,


1077
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:39,286
you'll create an editable


1078
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:41,936
field.strings file using the key


1079
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:43,666
being the initial phrase you


1080
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,526
created in your contents.swift.


1081
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,066
So again, tap to enter code, but


1082
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,326
you put in the appropriate


1083
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:50,606
translation for each other


1084
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:51,636
language you're supporting.


1085
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:56,036
And this is done at the base


1086
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,766
directory of the Playground book


1087
00:30:57,766 --> 00:30:59,306
in the private resources for the


1088
00:30:59,306 --> 00:31:00,806
associated languages.


1089
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:05,266
Next up is a page and chapter


1090
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:05,766
titles.


1091
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:09,046
And so here there is a manifest


1092
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:10,526
plist.strings file that you'll


1093
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:12,166
need to create for each page or


1094
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:14,866
chapter, and in this the app is


1095
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,846
looking for the key name to


1096
00:31:16,846 --> 00:31:18,626
substitute in the new name for


1097
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,506
the localized title for your


1098
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:20,836
book.


1099
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:26,246
And this is put in, again, the


1100
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:28,176
private resources for that


1101
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:29,866
particular page for each


1102
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:30,796
language project.


1103
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,016
So next up is the glossary.


1104
00:31:35,016 --> 00:31:36,696
And this is changing the format


1105
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:37,976
as it's using XML.


1106
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:39,666
And you'll need to make a copy


1107
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,596
for this for each language


1108
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:41,276
you're supporting.


1109
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:43,566
But here is an example of the


1110
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:44,606
English glossary.


1111
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:46,476
And we're looking at what the


1112
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:48,666
command definition is in


1113
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,156
English.


1114
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:52,256
So one thing to note here is


1115
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,166
that the top level key command


1116
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,246
is going to be the same across


1117
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,136
every language.


1118
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:58,546
This will be how the [applause]


1119
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,166
looks up the glossary definition


1120
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:01,646
and will not change.


1121
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,816
Similarly, the page reference


1122
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:07,046
should use a -- be by file


1123
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:08,776
reference and not be page


1124
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:10,576
referencing the title, which can


1125
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:11,416
cause it to break in


1126
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:12,796
localization if you were to


1127
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:13,576
change the title.


1128
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:17,236
And then there are several


1129
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,436
different strings that you will


1130
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,926
send off to your translator to


1131
00:32:19,926 --> 00:32:21,656
localize that you see here.


1132
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:24,216
So if this is put into Spanish,


1133
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:26,696
you then see the -- that overall


1134
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,016
everything is the same, except


1135
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:29,666
for those three strings get


1136
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,476
localized and will be displayed


1137
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,426
appropriately when the user runs


1138
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:35,346
the app in Spanish.


1139
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:38,966
And this glossary is stored at


1140
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:40,656
the base-level private resources


1141
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:41,636
in the project.


1142
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,506
So you'd have one in your


1143
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:45,996
English lproj, and then also a


1144
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:47,886
copy that's been translated for


1145
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:48,766
your Spanish project.


1146
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:54,006
Hints follow a similar format as


1147
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,776
the glossary in that they are


1148
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:56,966
using XML as well.


1149
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:58,646
But these are done on a per page


1150
00:32:58,646 --> 00:32:58,956
level.


1151
00:32:59,486 --> 00:33:02,456
And each page can have one or


1152
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:03,706
more hints if desired.


1153
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,906
And this is an example of what a


1154
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:06,906
hint file looks like.


1155
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:09,136
And in it are several different


1156
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:10,566
strings that your translators


1157
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:11,526
will need to translate.


1158
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:13,796
And so to -- you would make a


1159
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:16,076
copy of this file and have them


1160
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:18,096
localize these strings, and then


1161
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,066
you would get this output.


1162
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,746
And this new hintplist, this


1163
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:24,056
goes in the private resources


1164
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:25,836
directory for that page, as they


1165
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:26,946
only apply to that particular


1166
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:27,456
page.


1167
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:29,136
And you'd have both the English


1168
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:31,436
version and the Spanish version.


1169
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:36,206
And so last up are the animated


1170
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,026
cut scenes, which are html


1171
00:33:38,026 --> 00:33:38,606
files.


1172
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:40,996
And these, your translators will


1173
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:42,226
need to make a copy for each


1174
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,786
language and appropriately


1175
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:45,796
localize the strings, as well as


1176
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:47,236
potentially change any of the


1177
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:50,076
concepts or images as needed per


1178
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:50,906
each language.


1179
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:54,426
And when they do this, you will


1180
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:56,296
need to put it in the cut scene


1181
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:57,726
pages private resources


1182
00:33:57,726 --> 00:33:58,216
directory.


1183
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,116
So here we see the English


1184
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:01,396
version is called


1185
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:03,476
conditionalcode.html.


1186
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,776
And the initial html file for


1187
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,206
each other language needs to


1188
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:08,826
follow that exact same name.


1189
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:10,835
So for Spanish, even though


1190
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:11,795
it'll have all the localized


1191
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:13,505
terms, the file name should be


1192
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:15,025
conditionalcode.html.


1193
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:20,036
So in summary today, we covered


1194
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,456
a lot about localization.


1195
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:23,025
And one thing that's really key


1196
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:25,166
to remember is to define who


1197
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,886
your audience is, and be sure to


1198
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:28,565
understand them when you're


1199
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:29,706
going into each different


1200
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:31,045
language and trying to adapt the


1201
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:31,646
content.


1202
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:34,856
Localization is really nuance


1203
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:35,596
and complex.


1204
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:37,406
It requires a lot of research


1205
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:39,266
and testing with actual users,


1206
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,636
and understanding what are the


1207
00:34:40,636 --> 00:34:42,636
standards for each country or


1208
00:34:42,636 --> 00:34:44,076
language or region that you want


1209
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:44,676
to go into.


1210
00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:48,606
And one thing to keep in mind of


1211
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:51,096
all this is that localization is


1212
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,166
really part of the design


1213
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,056
process.


1214
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,516
And so you should be thinking


1215
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,426
about localization up front if


1216
00:34:56,426 --> 00:34:57,386
you want to have an amazing


1217
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,726
experience for your users.


1218
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,026
And I encourage you all to do


1219
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,596
so, and make amazing content


1220
00:35:02,876 --> 00:35:03,876
that everyone in the world can


1221
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:04,626
experience.


1222
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:08,016
There's more information on the


1223
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:09,316
developer website, as well as


1224
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,536
the sample code that goes along


1225
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:10,986
with this.


1226
00:35:11,516 --> 00:35:14,026
And there's some fantastic


1227
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:15,236
related sessions on both


1228
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:17,206
localization as well as using


1229
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:18,386
Swift Playgrounds and teaching


1230
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,326
with it.


1231
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:20,556
Thank you.


1232
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:23,508
[ Applause and Cheers ]
