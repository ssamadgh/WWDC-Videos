2
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:25,806
>> Good afternoon, everyone.


3
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,046
Let's hear it for Planet of the


4
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:27,746
Apps.


5
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,236
I'm Doug LeMoine from the Design


6
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:32,485
Evangelism Team, and welcome to


7
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:33,996
Design Studio Shorts.


8
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:35,806
This is the first of three


9
00:00:35,806 --> 00:00:38,476
sessions comprised of 10-minute


10
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,646
discussions of a variety of app


11
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,636
design topics.


12
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:43,666
In this session, we'll cover


13
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:48,246
games, subscriptions, app icons,


14
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:51,236
onboarding, and global


15
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:52,036
audiences.


16
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,296
First up is games.


17
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:56,496
Great games transport us into


18
00:00:56,496 --> 00:00:58,176
other dimensions where we can


19
00:00:58,176 --> 00:01:00,546
reign over a kingdom, fight epic


20
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:02,536
battles, or become pinball


21
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:03,106
wizards.


22
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:05,355
In this session, you'll learn


23
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,276
onboarding and UI design best


24
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,306
practices that will enable


25
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,556
everyone to lose themselves in


26
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:13,356
your game and, of course, have


27
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:13,706
fun.


28
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:15,986
Please welcome my colleague,


29
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:16,976
Lauren Strehlow.

[ Applause ]


31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,506
>> From first launch to your


32
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,866
tutorial through your user


33
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,736
interface, there's a lot that


34
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,446
people experience in addition to


35
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:33,596
your games' gameplay.


36
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:35,456
So, in the next few minutes, I'm


37
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:37,586
going to cover 10 design tips to


38
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:40,536
create great experiences as soon


39
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:42,186
as someone taps your app icon,


40
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,636
and many of these tips can be


41
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:46,206
applied to apps that are looking


42
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,526
to be just as immersive,


43
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:49,136
engaging, and fun.


44
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:50,526
So, let's start.


45
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:53,066
First up is first launch.


46
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,456
This is the first experience


47
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:57,426
people have with your game and


48
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:58,736
your first impression matters.


49
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:00,476
So, no matter what you need to


50
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:02,216
say first, whether it is Accept


51
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:04,586
Terms, or Headsets Recommended,


52
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,666
design the first screen to fit


53
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,175
within the style of your game.


54
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,166
That way, they're immersed


55
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:10,985
immediately.


56
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:13,056
This edge to edge illustration


57
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:14,806
from Pokemon Go does a great


58
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:16,886
job, and it communicates just as


59
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,536
much as the text on screen.


60
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,646
So, take the time to design what


61
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:23,126
people see first as soon as they


62
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:23,936
launch your game.


63
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:26,016
When this is done well, it'll


64
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,396
make a lasting impression and


65
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:28,636
set the tone for the rest of


66
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:29,146
your game.


67
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,466
Next is loading because


68
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:33,906
sometimes it takes just a few


69
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:35,326
seconds to pull data through


70
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:35,926
space.


71
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:37,956
So, then why not take advantage


72
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,436
of what we all know to be true,


73
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:41,906
time flies when you're having


74
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:42,316
fun.


75
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:45,146
So, during loading, make it fun


76
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:47,086
by educating or entertaining;


77
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:48,996
then, loading won't see to take


78
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:49,596
as long.


79
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:52,666
This is Don't Starve Pocket


80
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,546
Edition, and in this game


81
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,146
loading is masked by this


82
00:02:56,146 --> 00:02:57,856
beautifully creepy animation,


83
00:02:58,356 --> 00:02:59,856
players are entertained, and


84
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,366
time seems to fly by.


85
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,926
Loading is also a great time to


86
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:05,396
educate.


87
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:07,706
In Clash Royale, as you prepare


88
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,846
for battle, a game play tip is


89
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:10,866
shown on screen.


90
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:12,836
Now, if you choose to do this,


91
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,416
make sure that players have


92
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,756
enough time to read the tip and


93
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:18,306
also be intelligent about what


94
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,056
you show people.


95
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:20,776
If someone's already seen a tip,


96
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:22,226
don't repeat it in the same


97
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:22,776
session.


98
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,076
And finally, to show loading


99
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:27,206
progress, always favor progress


100
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:29,036
bars over activity indicators


101
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,506
because they do a much better


102
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:31,696
job communicating what's


103
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:33,326
happening and how long it will


104
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:33,656
take.


105
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,536
So, no matter when your game


106
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,876
needs to load, entertain,


107
00:03:38,446 --> 00:03:40,326
educate, and show progress.


108
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:42,166
All right.


109
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,016
Next is Quick Start.


110
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,286
Being able to start quickly and


111
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:48,226
jump into your game is key to a


112
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,666
great game experience.


113
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,366
This is INKS, and it's an Apple


114
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,896
Design Award winner from last


115
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:54,156
year.


116
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,106
It's really fun that you're able


117
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,526
to get a feeling for the game


118
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,486
right from launch, but also they


119
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,256
do a great job making it obvious


120
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,596
on how to start the game with


121
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:03,946
this large turquoise Play


122
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:04,316
button.


123
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:06,706
And as soon as you tap it, there


124
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,306
are only two screens before


125
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:09,846
you're in and playing the game,


126
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:11,146
which is awesome.


127
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,076
So, let people get into your


128
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:15,066
game easily and quickly.


129
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:17,396
Don't ask players to make too


130
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:18,526
many choices before they


131
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,096
understand what it means in your


132
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:20,505
game.


133
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,226
And for more complex games, I


134
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,336
know there are important things


135
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:25,146
that you want to show your


136
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:27,656
players, and game Main Menus


137
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:29,296
have become increasingly busy


138
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,026
with news, tournaments, stores,


139
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:34,016
and more, and these can all be


140
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:34,796
on your interface.


141
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,986
But make sure that the main call


142
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,876
to action to play, start,


143
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,716
battle, or begin a new game is


144
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,266
the most dominant in your Main


145
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:44,816
Menu UI.


146
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:46,986
All right.


147
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,526
Tip 4 is all about our game's


148
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:50,976
interface, and before we jump


149
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,866
into this tip, you should know


150
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,276
something about me, and that's,


151
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,246
I have a soft spot for classic


152
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:58,016
arcade games.


153
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:01,136
So, this fake alien monster game


154
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:02,556
is going to help us with a few


155
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:04,326
user interface best practices,


156
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,866
starting with consistency.


157
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:10,916
Consistency improves usability


158
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:12,926
because it helps people mentally


159
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:13,866
map your interface.


160
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,216
It's much easier to play and


161
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,786
navigate when controls are in


162
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:18,926
predictable locations.


163
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:21,146
So, be consistent in the layout


164
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,236
of your game's menu.


165
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,116
That way, people can spend their


166
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,006
energy playing you game versus


167
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:27,896
trying to recall where was that


168
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:28,626
Settings button.


169
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,966
So, let's look at the exact same


170
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,826
flow with an inconsistent UI.


171
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:36,176
The Back button is all over the


172
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:38,526
place, and Settings disappears


173
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,066
on the Choose Character screen.


174
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:43,366
This inconsistency disrupts a


175
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:45,436
player's experience because it


176
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:47,066
takes more effort to mentally


177
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:47,916
map the interface.


178
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:50,016
So, when you're designing, to


179
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,726
accommodate for consistency, lay


180
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,496
out all of your screens and


181
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,096
check them.


182
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:55,816
That way, you'll be able to tell


183
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:57,346
whether controls are in the same


184
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:57,636
place.


185
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,486
Okay. The next UI best practice


186
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,806
is all about clarity.


187
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,126
It needs to be clear to players


188
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:06,436
what's interactive and what's


189
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:06,836
not.


190
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,586
If people have to think too much


191
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:10,316
about what to tap, they're going


192
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,376
to be taken out of your game's


193
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:12,106
experience.


194
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,976
So, items that are tappable need


195
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:15,916
to look different from items


196
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:16,846
that are not tappable.


197
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:18,936
So, in the top center of this


198
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:21,396
screen, my Lives is actually


199
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:22,336
just Status.


200
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:24,026
But with this visual appearance,


201
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,106
it could be confused for


202
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:26,476
something that's interactive.


203
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:28,276
This is common in a lot of


204
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,836
games, and there is an easy fix.


205
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:32,156
Make non-interactive elements


206
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,716
look different by using color


207
00:06:33,716 --> 00:06:36,416
and shape, like this or this.


208
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:39,226
Or you can remove and put status


209
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,886
items away from interactive


210
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:41,436
elements.


211
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,216
In your interface, for clarity,


212
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:46,106
it's important always to include


213
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,156
three visual states for buttons


214
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,566
and controls because a lack of


215
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:51,906
visual feedback can confuse


216
00:06:51,906 --> 00:06:52,356
players.


217
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,126
Be sure to use a normal state to


218
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,126
show people that something's


219
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:56,656
tappable.


220
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,366
Use a press state when something


221
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,866
has been tapped.


222
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:02,436
And finally, use a disabled


223
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:03,786
state for control that's not


224
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:05,536
currently active or enabled.


225
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,626
Many developers struggle if they


226
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:10,646
should remove or hide a control


227
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:12,886
if it cannot be activated, but


228
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,936
if you do that, when it does pop


229
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,096
back it could be really


230
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:18,366
confusing to players, especially


231
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:19,746
if this happens during gameplay.


232
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:22,296
So, for a much better user


233
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,926
experience, use a disabled


234
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:24,296
state.


235
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:25,966
This lets people know the


236
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:28,086
controls location and action


237
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,526
that will be possible soon when


238
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:30,736
that control is enabled.


239
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:33,206
And finally, make sure that


240
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:34,726
everything that's interactive on


241
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:36,106
your game's interface meets the


242
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:38,536
minimum tap targets on IOS for


243
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,366
just 44 by 44 points.


244
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:43,436
Your interface is a tool to make


245
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:45,616
sense of your game's world, so


246
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,326
make it consistent and clear.


247
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,156
That way, people will be able to


248
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,776
stay engaged in your game.


249
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:52,316
All right.


250
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:53,696
I hope you all enjoy that fake


251
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:54,586
alien monster game.


252
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,036
It'll come back in a bit to help


253
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:59,076
us with a few other design tips.


254
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,026
We're already halfway through at


255
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:01,776
Number 5.


256
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:03,956
This tip and the next few are


257
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:05,436
about game tutorials.


258
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:07,656
Successful tutorials teach


259
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,376
gradually and in context through


260
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:10,446
progressive disclosure.


261
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:12,746
Your tutorial should be made up


262
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:14,836
of three basic parts that align


263
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,476
to the core loop of your game.


264
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,206
For example, it might be that


265
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,166
you have to fight monsters to


266
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,096
get some gold, and then buy some


267
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:25,166
stuff to fight more challenging


268
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:25,696
monsters.


269
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:29,066
But be sure, in your tutorial,


270
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,916
it stays to those three basic


271
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:31,426
parts.


272
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,946
If you have to keep, if you have


273
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,666
to teach about economy in your


274
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,405
game, keep it simple because,


275
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:39,716
remember, you're teaching


276
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,236
somebody something brand new.


277
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:44,346
So, avoid overwhelming people


278
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:45,636
and including information in


279
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:46,976
your tutorial that is not


280
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,086
essential to gameplay.


281
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,446
All of this, such as upgrades,


282
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,206
tournaments, messages, and your


283
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:55,436
store, can all be discovered


284
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:56,556
after your tutorial.


285
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,386
And also, in your tutorial, it's


286
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:00,826
really important to provide


287
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,046
clear direction.


288
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:04,316
If you have characters in your


289
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:06,236
game, it's pretty common to have


290
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,736
a character walk you through the


291
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:08,346
tutorial.


292
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:10,596
So, let's say we have this


293
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:13,636
adorable alien monster, keep


294
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,796
directions short and simple to


295
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:16,466
be effective.


296
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,546
So, whether you teach with a


297
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:21,056
character or through in-game


298
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,026
instructional text, a single


299
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:24,206
clear direction is going to be


300
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:25,166
the most effective.


301
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,776
And please, don't repeat


302
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,476
directions.


303
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:31,156
Respect your players and treat,


304
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,286
and don't treat them like


305
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:32,836
children.


306
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:34,946
Even if your players are


307
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,266
children, kids are smart.


308
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:38,476
So, repeating directions


309
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,296
unnecessarily lengthens your


310
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,406
tutorial, and that makes it less


311
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:43,856
effective and less fun.


312
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:46,466
And learning is really fun,


313
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:47,806
especially when the teacher is


314
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,556
engaging, creative, and


315
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:51,116
inventive.


316
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:53,106
So, be the cool teacher.


317
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,946
Don't just do what you've seen


318
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:55,586
others do.


319
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,606
If your game is unique, your


320
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:58,796
tutorial should be too.


321
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,546
For example, think about how you


322
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,126
can teach before your game


323
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:03,656
begins.


324
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:06,886
This is Splitter Critters, and


325
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,936
in this game you split the world


326
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:10,546
with a swipe of your finger and


327
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,706
then rearrange it to guide


328
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:12,596
critters back to their


329
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:13,166
spaceship.


330
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,036
And from the Start screen,


331
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,596
you're taught this key game


332
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:17,156
mechanic.


333
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,816
And one of the least effective


334
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:21,676
ways to teach is with a bouncing


335
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:22,096
arrow.


336
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:25,636
It's not effective because


337
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:27,136
people just end up playing tap


338
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,666
the pointing arrow game and not


339
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,136
learning.


340
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:31,326
And the same goes for the


341
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,056
floating hand.


342
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,556
Not only do you not learn, but


343
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:35,616
this method is really


344
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:37,236
problematic because it hides you


345
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,246
from the interface that you're


346
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,746
trying to be learning about.


347
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:42,086
So, there are much better


348
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:43,516
attention-getting devices that


349
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,836
are way more natural and


350
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:47,096
immersive, such as animation.


351
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:51,066
This is Reigns, and I was really


352
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,116
excited to hear that the


353
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,886
developer is soon updating to


354
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,156
remove the floating hand.


355
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,876
On the right, is the new


356
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,676
experience and, as you can see,


357
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,596
it's much more immersive; it's


358
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:03,466
just as effective, and it does a


359
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,096
great job getting you right into


360
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:07,656
the world of Reigns, and being


361
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:09,856
in the world of your game is the


362
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:10,146
best.


363
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,836
So, if you could let people jump


364
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:15,166
right in and learn through play,


365
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:16,846
that is going to be the most


366
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,686
effective way to teach them your


367
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:19,086
game.


368
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:22,716
So, this is Mars: Mars on Apple


369
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,166
TV, and it's really fun to be


370
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,286
able to jump right into the


371
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:26,636
game.


372
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:29,236
So, right now, I'm on Mars, and


373
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,446
the controls are intuitive, so


374
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:31,266
I'm going to start clicking


375
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,846
around, and after one hilarious


376
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:36,976
death, I quickly realize that


377
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,096
the objective is to land safely


378
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:39,976
on the stations.


379
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,456
So, for the best experience,


380
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,976
teach people through play.


381
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:48,276
All right.


382
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:50,866
We're already at Number 9, which


383
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,836
is all about letting people skip


384
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:54,476
and get right into your game.


385
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,246
Give the player control, and


386
00:11:57,246 --> 00:11:59,266
that way skip can create a much


387
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:00,726
better user experience.


388
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:03,676
Now, I love this opening


389
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,336
sequence from Icycle: On Thin


390
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:05,866
Ice.


391
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:08,046
It's clever, has a striking


392
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:09,456
style, and it provides you with


393
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,686
the motivation of the main


394
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,016
character, Dennis.


395
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,286
But when you tap on the screen,


396
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:15,896
a very subtle Skip button


397
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:18,916
appears, and that is great


398
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:21,186
because revealing Skip on tap is


399
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:22,236
a wonderful technique.


400
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:24,386
Players who are ready to jump


401
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,466
right into your game can, and


402
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:27,646
people who want to watch the


403
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,186
entire sequence can stay


404
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,316
immersed with edge to edge


405
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:30,686
playback.


406
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:34,316
Now, letting players skip also


407
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:36,026
applies to tutorials.


408
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,326
This is Zombie Gunship, and


409
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,456
check out the upper left-hand


410
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:40,866
corner.


411
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:42,166
It's awesome.


412
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,746
There is a Skip Tutorial button,


413
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,416
and it feels great to be able to


414
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,776
jump right into the game.


415
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:49,946
Just be sure if you allow people


416
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:51,746
to skip your tutorial, they're


417
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:53,676
able to relaunch or replay the


418
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:55,116
tutorial in case they need a


419
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:56,146
refresher on the rules.


420
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,696
Now, I understand that this may


421
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,166
not work for every game.


422
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:01,886
So, if it's critical to your


423
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:03,716
game's progression to include a


424
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,576
tutorial level, teach the


425
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,166
basics, gradually adding context


426
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,386
through progressive disclosure,


427
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:11,016
and then get out of the way.


428
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,676
Letting players skip is about


429
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,296
putting the player's experience


430
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,706
first because you don't know


431
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:21,496
someone's skill level or how


432
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:22,956
much time they have to play your


433
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:23,376
game.


434
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:26,796
And I'm sure we have all button


435
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,396
smashed and clicked as quickly


436
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,596
as possible to get through a


437
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:31,026
tutorial just to get into the


438
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:31,446
game.


439
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:33,546
So, for a much better user


440
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,166
experience, provide a Skip


441
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,076
Tutorial button.


442
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:41,166
So, respect the player and that


443
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,936
way, they will be able to have a


444
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:44,446
much better user experience.


445
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,256
The final design tip today is


446
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:49,756
about being inclusive.


447
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,626
There's a lot that you can do to


448
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,696
make your game more accessible,


449
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,676
such as adding closed captions


450
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,276
or supporting dynamic type.


451
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:00,956
You can also, just like in


452
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,946
Mushroom 11, support Left and


453
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:06,546
Right-Hand Mode, or you can


454
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,156
support Color Blind Mode, like


455
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,066
in Kami 2.


456
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:10,926
And one of the coolest


457
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,246
accessibility updates that I


458
00:14:12,246 --> 00:14:14,046
have seen is from Blackbox,


459
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,506
which is a visual puzzler that


460
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:18,366
now includes sonic interfaces to


461
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,146
let players with low or no


462
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,666
vision play through solving


463
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,766
puzzles with sound.


464
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:26,256
With 285 million blind or


465
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,576
low-vision people in the world,


466
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:29,366
everybody should be able to play


467
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,856
games and have fun.


468
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:33,476
All right.


469
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,096
With these 10 design tips,


470
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,496
you'll be able to create great


471
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:39,386
experiences from the moment


472
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,076
someone taps your icon.


473
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,796
But remember, of all things,


474
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,276
respect you players, include


475
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,836
everyone, and put their


476
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:48,746
experience first.


477
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:48,946
Thank you.
