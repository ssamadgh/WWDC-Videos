[ Applause ]

00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:21,066
This session is What's New
in iOS User Interface Design.


5
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:23,646
And I want to thank so
many of you for caring


6
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:26,226
about software design, for
being here at nine o'clock


7
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,616
in the morning to talk


8
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:30,486
about this topic that's
very important to us.


9
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:32,055
If this were another company


10
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,196
and if this were another
developer conference,


11
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:40,736
I might imagine a full room
could be a session like this


12
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:44,516
but it's not, we are Apple,
we care about software design,


13
00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:47,336
and this is what this
session is about.


14
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:53,706
[Applause] So why don't you
guys give yourself a hand.


15
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:56,516
I'm Greg Christie and I'm here


16
00:00:56,516 --> 00:01:00,156
to introduce Mike Stern
eventually and talk


17
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:02,176
about what the new
user interface means


18
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:03,146
to you as developers.


19
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:08,046
I thought the keynote
went great.


20
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:09,616
I hope you guys all enjoyed it.


21
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:13,956
You guys have been playing with
iOS 7 for a day and a half now


22
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:16,526
and so I thought it would be
a really great way to start


23
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:23,466
if we take a fresh look at
Jony's words and the video now


24
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,696
that you've used iOS
7 for a day and a half


25
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:29,526
and can get some context into
what he was talking about.


26
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:34,746
So, I'd like to start with that.


27
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,276
[ Music ]


28
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:53,096
>> We have always thought of
design as being so much more


29
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:56,816
than just the way
something looks.


30
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,696
It's the whole thing.


31
00:01:57,766 --> 00:02:05,586
The way something actually works
on so many different levels.


32
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,936
Ultimately, of course,
design defines


33
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:19,966
so much of our experience.


34
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:20,033
[ Music ]


35
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:26,856
I think there is a profound and
enduring beauty in simplicity,


36
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,826
in clarity, in efficiency.


37
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:33,796
True simplicity is
derived from so much more


38
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:39,246
than just the absence of
clutter and ornamentation.


39
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,616
It's about bringing
order to complexity.


40
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:47,596
[ Music ]


41
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:57,106
iOS 7 is a clear
representation of these goals.


42
00:02:57,106 --> 00:03:00,856
It has a whole new
structure that is coherent


43
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:08,166
and it is applied
across the entire system.


44
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:08,566
[ Music ]


45
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:12,386
We've considered
the tiniest details,


46
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:21,586
like refining the
typography, to much larger ones


47
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,386
like redesigning all the icons,


48
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:28,306
and developing a grid
system allowed us


49
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:31,496
to achieve a much more
harmonious relationship


50
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:34,046
between individual elements.


51
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:41,906
We've also incorporated a
whole new palette of colors.


52
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:42,266
[ Music ]


53
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:50,876
Distinct, functional layers help
establish hierarchy and order.


54
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:50,996
[ Music ]


55
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:58,546
And the use of translucency
gives you a sense


56
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:01,066
of your context.


57
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:06,036
These planes, combined with
new approaches to animation


58
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:10,306
and motion, create a sense
of depth and vitality.


59
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:10,496
[ Music ]


60
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:19,796
The iPhone responding to your
movements drives the parallax


61
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:21,906
to create a whole new
experience of depth.


62
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:21,973
[ Music ]


63
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:26,336
In many ways, we've tried
to create an interface


64
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:34,646
that is unobtrusive
and deferential.


65
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:39,626
One where the design
recedes and in doing


66
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:44,146
so actually elevates
your content.


67
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:51,236
Even the simple act of changing
your wallpaper has a very


68
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:57,726
noticeable effect on the way
your iPhone looks and feels


69
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,466
across the entire system.


70
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,056
[ Music ]


71
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:08,686
While iOS 7 is completely
new, it was important to us


72
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:10,956
to make it instantly familiar.


73
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:12,776
[ Music ]


74
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:20,186
We wanted to take an experience
the people know very well


75
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:25,556
and actually add to it
to make it more useful,


76
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,656
to make enjoyable.


77
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:31,816
To create it, we brought
together a broad range


78
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,256
of expertise from
design to engineering.


79
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:41,686
With what we've been able to
achieve together, we see iOS 7


80
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,416
as defining an important
new direction,


81
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:55,156
and in many ways, a beginning.


82
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:57,626
[ Music ]

00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,096

84
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:02,436
>> Greg Christie: I won't
do nearly that well but.


85
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,006
What's new in iOS 7?


86
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:07,676
Well, everything is new.


87
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:10,846
It's a 100 percent
new pixels there.


88
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,466
No pixel here has
been used before


89
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,786
in any previous release of iOS.


90
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:20,866
A really great example to look
at when we talk about what's new


91
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,396
in iOS 7 and where we're
headed is the Weather app.


92
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:26,496
It's not the most important app


93
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,586
on the phone unless you really
need to know what the weather is


94
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:30,986
and it's not the most used app,


95
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:34,576
but it really gives
a great indication


96
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:36,576
of what we're doing with iOS 7.


97
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:41,176
You guys by now are familiar


98
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:42,946
with the animated
weather states,


99
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:44,946
how they occupy the
full display.


100
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:53,566
It's really interesting
comparing old and new side


101
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,646
by side and you can see a lot


102
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:58,006
of what we were doing is
maximizing the screen size,


103
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:03,626
blowing out the edges, removing
unnecessary edges and borders,


104
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,876
refining the typography,
refining the line work,


105
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,906
really just creating a whole
new immersive experience.


106
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,786
The graphical ornamentation
is now an intrinsic part


107
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:14,586
of the application.


108
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,076
It's not just tacked on.


109
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:20,156
Okay? You can see
all those things here


110
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:24,066
in detail compared to that.


111
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:25,896
It's really interesting.


112
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:33,676
Johnny touches on four
key notions in the video


113
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:36,276
and that's what we're going
to talk about here today,


114
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,476
because when everything has
changed it's hard to know


115
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,086
where to start, so we'll
start with the simplest notion


116
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,036
and that's one of clarity.


117
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:45,036
Clarity simply put
is being clear.


118
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:49,986
In the Weather app we're
very clear in terms


119
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,626
of what the temperature is


120
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:53,026
and what the current
weather conditions are.


121
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:57,296
We make the current temperature
as large as possible,


122
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:01,366
yet fit in a sound design with
the rest of the information.


123
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:06,216
Being clear means clearly
indicating what's text


124
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,826
and what's a control,
what's content


125
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:13,086
and what's a control layer.


126
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:17,586
Another important concept
is this of deference, right.


127
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:21,486
So what we're doing in our apps
now is deferring to the content.


128
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:24,656
We're letting photos be
photos, web pages be web pages,


129
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:27,806
email messages be
email messages,


130
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:29,796
but there's another
side of deference.


131
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,866
This is very important
for you folks and that's


132
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:38,876
that iOS now has a design that
defers to your apps, okay?


133
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:43,956
We're not putting a really
strong visual imprint


134
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,396
on the overall system
so that your apps,


135
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:49,396
if you're doing custom UI, will
feel out of place on the system.


136
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:51,616
Our UI is now getting
out of the way,


137
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,526
we're letting your
apps be your apps


138
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,036
and letting the customer's
content be the


139
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,016
customer's content.


140
00:08:57,456 --> 00:09:01,366
Another way that we're
reinforcing clarity


141
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,316
and this difference between
controls and content,


142
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,666
is by our use of depth.


143
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:09,446
You see this really strongly
in the case of the Home screen.


144
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,756
We're using this layering
model and we're using layers


145
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:14,856
and notification center
and control center


146
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:16,806
and within the individual
apps themselves.


147
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:21,556
Having controls exist on one
layer, content exist on another.


148
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,416
Finally, detail.


149
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:31,286
Detail really shows itself
in terms of topography,


150
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:39,596
using a consistent and coherent
set of weights and sizes


151
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:45,686
and in colors and
in the iconography.


152
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:50,286
Again, we're using a highly
disciplined, controlled,


153
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:55,276
limited set of colors yet it
provides a very rich pallet


154
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:59,786
and one that can express you
know just the incredible variety


155
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:01,456
of apps that are on iOS.


156
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,516
This also applies to the
Glyphs, things that appear


157
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,476
in button bars, toolbars,
those types of things.


158
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,596
These have all been
normalized with regard


159
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:11,186
to line weight and
shape and size.


160
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:14,716
Paying attention to
the details matters.


161
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:17,256
It matters a lot.


162
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,926
Another thing that
we're doing with regard


163
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:24,606
to detail is we're finally
exploiting the retina screens


164
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,296
to their, you know,
fullest capability.


165
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:29,436
We've lots of single pixel
details, single pixel lines


166
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:31,826
that we're using and exploiting
throughout the system.


167
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:38,786
Okay? So here to walk you
through the nuts and bolts


168
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:41,196
of what we did and some of
what you will have to do


169
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:45,656
to bring your apps into the
iOS 7 world is Mike Stern.


170
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:50,526
He's going to walk you
through some of these things.

173
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:59,706
I'm really excited to be
with you this morning to go


174
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:03,406
into some detail about iOS
7 and some of the new apps


175
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:04,636
like Mail and Calendar.


176
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:07,386
We're going to compare
how they are now


177
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:10,496
with how they were before and
I'm going to talk a little bit


178
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:14,116
about why things have changed,
the thought process that went


179
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:17,386
into the new apps and I'm
really hoping that you'll take


180
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,746
from this hour some ideas


181
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:21,436
about how you can make
your apps more dynamic,


182
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:24,986
easier to use and
more delightful.


183
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:28,636
I've got a lot to
cover so let's dive in.


184
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:34,936
This was how the design
for iOS 7 started.


185
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:38,346
We started with a
totally blank slate.


186
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:42,446
We had to think about what's
the most important thing


187
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:43,436
that people care about.


188
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,186
What's the content that
they care about most?


189
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,646
So in Mail it's this.


190
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,056
It's the message,
it's a single thing.


191
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:54,896
Of all else that you see in
mail that's the most important.


192
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,716
Everything else is secondary.


193
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:59,786
And for what was
added, it was added


194
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:01,916
with really great restraint.


195
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:04,966
We had to make sure that
anything that was added


196
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,306
to this was absolutely
necessary.


197
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:11,936
So eventually started adding
things like date and sender


198
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:15,956
but again it was secondary
to what mattered most.


199
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,796
Eventually we added controls
but we did so in a way


200
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:28,656
that didn't interfere with
your ability to read text.


201
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:33,246
It doesn't take much to make
these controls available


202
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:36,086
and legible, easy to access.


203
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:39,806
Now you've got to do a
little bit more than that


204
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,356
so color got added
at a later stage just


205
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,166
to distinguish controls
from content.


206
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:48,736
Some background colors,
a couple of crisp lines


207
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:54,016
but at all times the message
stayed present, it stayed front


208
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,146
and center, it was
the star of the show.


209
00:12:56,766 --> 00:13:00,126
Then this is the
final design for Mail.


210
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:03,676
As you can see when photos
were added they were made to be


211
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,916
as large as possible so that
you can see as much detail


212
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,696
as possible without having to
pinch to zoom quite so much.


213
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:17,306
Now this focus in
starting with type first,


214
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:20,516
that really prioritized
type for us


215
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,616
and I don't think this will come
as a big shock to anybody here,


216
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,136
Apple has always
been deeply committed


217
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:29,816
to making the displayed and
the printed word as legible


218
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,766
as possible and gorgeous.


219
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:38,246
So that's how dynamic type came
about and there's a lot of stuff


220
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:41,896
in dynamic type and I'm sure you
guys have already heard quite a


221
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:44,386
bit about it in previous
sessions, but I want to focus


222
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:47,916
on two aspects of that,
scaling and styles.


223
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:50,786
Let's start with text scaling.


224
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:57,026
Now a big part of legibility
is the size of type.


225
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:00,666
I've worked as an interface
designer for 17 years


226
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:03,296
and I've worked on countless
projects and probably


227
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:06,086
on every single one type
was a big component of it,


228
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,896
and you know I or my team
would develop designs


229
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:13,096
and we would show them
to stakeholders, clients


230
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,706
and you'd always get this
diversity of reactions.


231
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,546
"I'm getting too old, my eyes
ain't what they used to be


232
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:24,466
and this is really hard to read"
or you know, "make text smaller,


233
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:27,326
it's truncating too quickly,
there's not enough controls,


234
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,746
I want to see more stuff
because it's more powerful


235
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,776
and I can deal with all
of that complexity."


236
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:36,986
And it's impossible to satisfy
both ends of that spectrum.


237
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:37,886
How do you do it?


238
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:40,256
You normally had to
pick one size of type.


239
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,896
I mean maybe you could build
some kind of custom thing


240
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:43,946
that allowed text to scale


241
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:47,286
but it was prohibitively
expensive engineering-wise,


242
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:53,716
and the results probably
would not be very good.


243
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:57,246
Dynamic type is game changing
because it allows for that


244
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:59,136
and it's really easy to use.


245
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:06,296
You have a huge diversity
of sizes to choose from


246
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:10,316
and with the accessibility
mode you can have,


247
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:11,686
you know, massive text.


248
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:12,926
It's really great.


249
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:16,836
But simply scaling type,
this is Helvetica Neue Light,


250
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,496
which looks really
awesome when it's big


251
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:23,196
but when it's small it
doesn't work very well.


252
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,156
It's not very legible.


253
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,426
The letter forms are very thin.


254
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:26,246
They're very delicate.


255
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:32,866
So to resolve for that,
to solve for that,


256
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:37,126
you can make small type bold
but that results in large type


257
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:41,356
which looks heavy and cumbersome
so this isn't very good either.


258
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:47,396
So dynamic type dynamically
makes text heavier


259
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:50,226
when it's smaller and
thinner when it's lighter.


260
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,256
Has a range of about
two weights.


261
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:56,646
As a result text has
this great continuity.


262
00:15:56,646 --> 00:15:58,136
It looks great at every size,


263
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,516
but of course we
didn't stop there.


264
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,706
Text that has more
space between characters


265
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:06,486
at small sizes is
also more legible


266
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:08,736
so dynamic type does
that as well.


267
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:12,676
It dynamically adjusts, very
fine tune, sub-pixel level,


268
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,026
the space between characters


269
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:16,446
so no matter what size you
choose your text is going


270
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:16,966
to look great.


271
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,146
Now let's talk about styles.


272
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:23,896
In printed publishing,
typesetting, you know,


273
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:28,206
word processing we have these
categories for type like Body,


274
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:31,186
Headline, Caption,
and that helps you


275
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:35,476
to establish a clear information
hierarchy in your UI.


276
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:37,156
Some text is more
important than others


277
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:38,466
so it should be bigger
and heavier.


278
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,026
Some stuff less so right?


279
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:43,796
You guys are familiar
with this stuff.


280
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:46,626
You've seen it a million
times and this is a really,


281
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:50,006
really great system so we've
made that a fundamental part


282
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:53,626
of dynamic text-- type.


283
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:55,736
So this is the Inbox and all


284
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:58,566
of this was designed
using type styles.


285
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:02,266
The Inbox, the title for the
screen is the most important


286
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:04,195
thing here so you
know where you are,


287
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,256
you know what you're looking at.


288
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:07,526
Secondarily who sent it?


289
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:10,036
At this stage in time that's
the most important thing


290
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:13,076
that you need to know so
those use the heaviest styles.


291
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:18,226
It's really clean and
these styles allow you


292
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:20,786
to create relationships
between different types of text,


293
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:24,236
so you can see the intent
of how you're trying


294
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:25,506
to establish that hierarchy.


295
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:29,836
And of course these two
features work together.


296
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:36,166
Fine tune adjustments were made
to every one of these pieces


297
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:41,756
of text, every one of these
combinations of style and size.


298
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,206
So the other thing
that I want to point


299
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:46,836
out is there's line
height, which is the space


300
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,596
between lines of
text or leading.


301
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:52,686
And that adjusts too
so it's proportional.


302
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:57,076
So the composition of your
interface has great integrity no


303
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,526
matter what the text scale is.


304
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,356
These kinds of details
are really important


305
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,636
with visual design.


306
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:06,766
Now typography is
really complicated.


307
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,466
I've been a designer for
a while and I've worked


308
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:12,826
with some amazing designers
who can make great icons,


309
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,476
have a great sense of
composition and color,


310
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:17,966
good interaction designers


311
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,086
but I've seen people
struggle with typography.


312
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:24,006
It's something that a lot of us
as designers aren't trained for.


313
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:26,136
People go to school for this


314
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,336
for a really long
time and read books.


315
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:30,436
There's a lot of details here.


316
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:35,716
But luckily we have some really
good type designers at Apple


317
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:40,166
who have spent a lot of time
perfecting type in iOS 7.


318
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:43,996
So they've taken something
that's extremely hard to do well


319
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,236
and they made it really easy.


320
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:50,196
All right, let's move on.


321
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:54,446
So let's talk about
some of the differences


322
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,866
between iOS 7 and iOS 6 Mail.


323
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,586
Let's talk about bars.


324
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:01,836
Not the ones you
guys are going to go


325
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:05,856
to tonight but navigation bars.


326
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:08,926
Now obviously this has
changed quite a bit.


327
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:12,116
It's no longer this blue plastic
material that's convex in shape


328
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:15,336
and meant to portray some
sense of dimensionality.


329
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:19,396
It's now this solid white
color and it extends to the top


330
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:22,326
of the screen to work
really closely well,


331
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:26,036
work well with the status bar so
they work as one unified element


332
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,276
and it's still really clean.


333
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:29,306
It's easy to see everything
what's inside of it.


334
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:32,016
There's a lot of nice negative
space there, white space.


335
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:35,926
And the toolbar was designed
to match both of those


336
00:19:37,286 --> 00:19:39,356
and as you can see it's
blurring the background content.


337
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:40,716
We saw that in the video before


338
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:42,716
so it's not completely
occluding,


339
00:19:42,836 --> 00:19:44,796
clobbering the content behind.


340
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:47,476
As a result Mail
was more expansive.


341
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,446
It goes from edge to edge,
side to side, top to bottom


342
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:54,666
and the message, the
text and the picture,


343
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,576
it comes to the foreground more.


344
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:59,656
It's not stuck behind
these two blue bars


345
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:03,376
and that's what matters
most so we're deferring


346
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:07,916
to that through the UI.


347
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:10,576
Now we've removed the
borders around buttons


348
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:15,876
or bezels, as I might call them.


349
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:16,676
Why did we do that?


350
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:17,876
Well it's a really
simple reason.


351
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:21,046
When you get rid of that
ornamentation you have more room


352
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:23,236
to make text larger
and more legible.


353
00:20:24,126 --> 00:20:26,736
Icons can be bigger and
they stand out more,


354
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:28,816
they're not competing
with the border themselves


355
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:29,906
for your attention.


356
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:34,756
The Back button, it remains
essentially unchanged.


357
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:37,076
It's still pointing to the
left side of the screen,


358
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,516
it's still the same height,
it still has the same label,


359
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,016
it's really easy to use.


360
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:43,596
You don't need the
border so it's gone.


361
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,976
Now words really matter
in interface design.


362
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,726
You have to answer the question
that your user is asking


363
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:56,006
in the way that they've
asked that question.


364
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:59,676
So, for example, this status
text, this isn't something


365
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,136
that we particularly innovated
but we improved upon it,


366
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,116
we can make it better.


367
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:06,596
The user is asking how
current is this content?


368
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:07,976
Rather than tell them the time


369
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,496
of day we tell them how
long ago this was updated.


370
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,356
So I want you guys to think
about that in your apps.


371
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,006
How are you phrasing things?


372
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:15,976
Are things technical?


373
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:18,606
Do people need to parse
them and interpret them?


374
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,076
Can you make it easier
for them to understand?


375
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:22,806
Can you speak with more clarity?


376
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:26,766
We heard about this
is Jony's video


377
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,606
but it was really important
to establish familiarity


378
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:32,146
and that was true for the
whole iOS and it's true


379
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:33,346
for every single
one of our apps.


380
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,386
So let's look at some
examples of that.


381
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:38,716
There's some really new,
powerful new features


382
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:39,716
that were added to Mail.


383
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:43,256
You can add smart searches
to quickly find mail


384
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:47,166
with attachments or flagged
messages, unread messages,


385
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,426
you can add links to
mailboxes you go to frequently.


386
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:54,556
That's powerful stuff but it was
added in a way that was logical,


387
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:57,396
it was an extension of what
people already knew before


388
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:00,526
which is to go into this Edit
mode, so it's really seamless.


389
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:02,086
Think about that with your apps.


390
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:06,066
You make an app, you release
it, people get to know how


391
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,646
to use it, they get
accustomed to certain things,


392
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:11,146
location of controls
and nomenclature,


393
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,026
and then you do an update and
you add some new features.


394
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:18,126
You don't want to completely
move things around on them.


395
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:20,946
That makes people
confused, frustrated,


396
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:24,746
it's not a good thing.


397
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,836
Another great example
of that is Action Sheet.


398
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:29,126
So this is visually different.


399
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:31,636
You can see we removed the
borders around buttons here too


400
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:35,126
and as a result it's much more
compact and you can see more


401
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,196
of the message still even


402
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,266
when the Action Sheet is
up, which is important.


403
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:40,336
It's important to know
what you're acting upon.


404
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:42,636
But a lot has remained the same.


405
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:45,586
The order that these are
in, the labels that we used,


406
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,496
red still warns you about
potentially harmful actions,


407
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:51,056
the safest button is at the
bottom and it's separated


408
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:53,516
out from the rest and it's
the easiest to access.


409
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:57,126
It's a lot of important stuff
that's remained exactly the same


410
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,436
so it's instantly familiar.


411
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,116
Let's move onto Calendar.


412
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:07,766
So as you can see, Calendar
has changed as well.


413
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,226
It's adopted a lot of the
same design language as Mail


414
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:12,766
so it's now open
and less fragmented,


415
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:16,146
but that's not what
I want to talk about.


416
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:19,736
I want to talk about that, that
segmented control right there.


417
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:22,026
I'm going to spend a little
bit of time with this.


418
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:25,206
In particular, I'm going
to start with the Day


419
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:27,966
and Month buttons in
the segmented control.


420
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:31,706
Now as we know there's a
hierarchal relationship


421
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,526
between days and months.


422
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:36,286
We all have that
deeply engrained in us,


423
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,156
seconds are in minutes
are in hours are in days,


424
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,786
I hope I get this right, are
in weeks are in months are


425
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:44,676
in years are in decades,
centuries.


426
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:48,806
It's really important that
the information hierarchy


427
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:54,126
of the data inside of your app
is respected by the interface.


428
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:56,666
The interface is a
natural fit for that.


429
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:59,116
I'll explain more
about what I mean.


430
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:05,246
So this is the Month view and
as you can see if I want to get


431
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:09,606
to today I don't have the button
there in the bottom to press,


432
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:10,736
so how do I get there?


433
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:13,176
Well, I simply press the 12.


434
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:17,076
Now before I do that I want
to have you guys pay attention


435
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:18,926
to where that red dot goes.


436
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:23,526
See how it just splits open?


437
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:26,986
That animation reinforces
that feeling that you've dove


438
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:31,496
into that day and the week stays
around at the top so you can use


439
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:33,856
that as a control,
which is really elegant.


440
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:39,046
And we conceptualize hierarchy
visually from top to bottom,


441
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,066
right, that's the way we
typically think about it.


442
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:43,166
Look at the order of things.


443
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:46,486
The Back button shows you the
month, the week below that,


444
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:49,656
the current day below that
and then the hours below that.


445
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:54,306
It's perfectly complementing
our mental model of hierarchy.


446
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:56,436
So it's a really nice design.


447
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,446
Now I also want to
talk about animation


448
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:01,766
and moving across days.


449
00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:05,196
So this day picker, or this
week view, sticks around.


450
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:09,576
So if I want to see what
I did on Monday we get


451
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,736
that lateral animation.


452
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:12,526
It gives us a really
nice intuitive sense


453
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:13,586
of movement through time.


454
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:17,756
And if we go to Friday,
again, it just goes


455
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:18,956
in the opposite direction.


456
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:22,396
So we always have our context.


457
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,856
It really feels solid.


458
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:25,946
We're oriented inside
the application


459
00:25:25,946 --> 00:25:26,956
and that's really important.


460
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:30,576
The opposite of feeling in
context is feeling lost.


461
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:34,136
It's really easy to get
lost in someone's interface.


462
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:41,486
So, oops, went too fast.


463
00:25:42,286 --> 00:25:44,906
So in iOS 6 and before
there was this swipe.


464
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:47,076
You would swipe anywhere
on the Calendar, to move -


465
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:49,126
to move to the next
day or the previous day


466
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:52,906
and so we extended
that to the week.


467
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:53,926
It's really natural.


468
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,216
It's really powerful.


469
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,676
So now I can also
animate to the next week


470
00:25:57,676 --> 00:25:58,656
to see what's going on there.


471
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:04,696
So the next thing I want to
talk about with animation is


472
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,956
that making really
good animations is kind


473
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:08,746
of a tricky thing.


474
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:11,296
It's really delicate yet
there's a lot of subtlety to it.


475
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:13,876
You're trying to reproduce
the feeling of real life.


476
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:18,566
So the next thing we'll do is go
back, step back through the days


477
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:20,586
of this week and I want
you to pay attention


478
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:21,816
to how the animation works.


479
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:24,066
You don't just go from
point A to point B.


480
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:28,276
You go to point A to point B
and you overshoot and come back.


481
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:29,966
Let's look at that.


482
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:33,346
See that little bounce?


483
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:37,356
That bounce adds a sense
of physical realism.


484
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:39,716
We get this kind
of intuitive sense


485
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:41,206
of how the mechanics
of this work.


486
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:45,486
And that imparts a
sense of liveliness.


487
00:26:46,796 --> 00:26:49,736
Not through the visual design
but through how things respond


488
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:51,306
to our touch interactions.


489
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:55,106
And this kind of stuff you
can do with UI dynamics.


490
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:59,156
That physics engine that
we've built in, you can apply


491
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:02,466
that to your apps to make them
feel more deeply lifelike.


492
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:07,356
It's great stuff.


493
00:27:08,786 --> 00:27:10,986
So now we want to get
back to the Month field


494
00:27:11,036 --> 00:27:11,786
and how do we do that?


495
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:13,076
Well we press the Back button


496
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:17,286
and as you just saw the
animation is the opposite


497
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:20,016
of what we saw before
when we went into the Day.


498
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,486
And that's really
important too with animation.


499
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:25,116
You want to make sure that your
animations are symmetrical.


500
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:27,906
I've seen tons of apps
where getting from point A


501
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:30,116
to point B there's
one type of animation


502
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:32,716
but coming back again it's a
different type of animation


503
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:36,616
or there's no animation at
all, and that's deeply bizarre.


504
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,536
You want to make sure you
have symmetry in animation.


505
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:43,076
Now the great thing
about this new design is


506
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:44,006
that it's scalable.


507
00:27:44,636 --> 00:27:46,976
So now we can do something
we couldn't do before using


508
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:48,756
that segmented control.


509
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:50,966
We can go back up to the Year.


510
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:53,456
Let's watch as that
animation happens


511
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,226
because this is really keen.


512
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,276
The whole screen shrinks down
to where the Month is now.


513
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:03,896
Your eye follows it so there's
no doubt where, how you get back


514
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:04,996
to where you were before.


515
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,956
You feel in context the
hierarchy is really clear


516
00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:09,296
through that zoom out animation.


517
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:13,296
And what's really awesome about
this is that that same approach


518
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:16,856
to animation applies to
when we exit Calendar


519
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:18,156
and go back to the Home screen.


520
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:19,226
So let's do that now.


521
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:24,076
The Year shrinks
down to the app icon.


522
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:26,516
If you accidentally press
the Home button and you want


523
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:28,996
to quickly go back to
Calendar, it's really easy to do


524
00:28:28,996 --> 00:28:31,916
that because your eye
tracked to the app icon.


525
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:36,616
That kind of rigor,
systematic application


526
00:28:36,616 --> 00:28:40,636
of animation throughout the
platform, throughout iOS 7,


527
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:44,236
is really important and I think
there's something to take away


528
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,766
from that with your apps.


529
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,856
You want to be consistent.


530
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:48,466
You want to be rigorous.


531
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:51,346
It leads to a really
cohesive user experience


532
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:52,376
and it's really important


533
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,886
to have your app stand
out from the rest.


534
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:57,386
Let's watch as we dive back in


535
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:58,576
and just see it all
come together.


536
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:05,716
[Silence] It's really
fluid, really natural.


537
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:11,426
All right, now Greg
talked about clarity.


538
00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:14,296
A big part of that is starting
with functionality and thinking


539
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,956
about how to design
your application


540
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,216
so it's a pure expression
of that functionality.


541
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,416
You pick up the phone,
you look at the app


542
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:24,716
and you immediately know what
this is capable of doing,


543
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:28,086
what this is for and how
you're supposed to use it.


544
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:32,186
This is a theme you're going
to see in a lot of these apps.


545
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,206
So this was the third button
in that segmented control.


546
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,546
This is the List view.


547
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:38,596
Now the List view
is kind of useful


548
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:41,606
but what was really powerful
about the List view is


549
00:29:41,606 --> 00:29:42,526
that you could search it.


550
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:46,826
Searching is really useful
but you wouldn't know


551
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,136
that by the fact
that it was stuck


552
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:49,836
in the List view
unless you lived


553
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:52,906
in the List view all the time,
you would be missing the fact


554
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:54,346
that you could search Calendar.


555
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:58,816
So to rectify that Search was
put at the top right corner


556
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:01,046
so it's immediately
available at any point


557
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:02,536
when you're using Calendar.


558
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:04,676
And you can apply
that too to your app.


559
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:07,006
I mean what's the really
important functionality


560
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:07,506
in your app?


561
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,396
Is it placed in the
right location?


562
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:10,446
Is it understandable?


563
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:12,146
Can people find it?


564
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:15,816
Now getting rid of clutter
is a big part of that.


565
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:18,736
If there's less things competing
for someone's attention,


566
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:20,636
they're more likely
to see what matters.


567
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:25,716
Now we can search,
we can see the list,


568
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,086
it's really straight forward.


569
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:32,756
So while we're talking
about Search,


570
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,506
let's spend a second
with these two icons.


571
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:36,716
I'm going to give
you some free advice.


572
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,116
Okay, it's going
to cost you $1,600


573
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:42,766
but I think it's
totally worth it.


574
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,556
These icons work
really, really well.


575
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:49,686
You guys all know, I don't
know all of you but I know


576
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:53,146
that you know what these mean,
Search and Add something,


577
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:54,706
whatever that is,
depends on the context


578
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:56,936
of the application you're
in, but it totally works.


579
00:30:57,236 --> 00:31:00,446
And it works because you've
seen these icons a million times


580
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:04,346
and every time you've pressed
one of those icons it responded


581
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:05,856
in a really consistent way.


582
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:07,026
It allowed you to search.


583
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:08,136
It allowed you to add whatever.


584
00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:12,666
Most icons don't fall
into that category.


585
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:16,766
Now I've made who knows
how many icons in my time.


586
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,456
More than I care to
even think about.


587
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:22,726
And I think I'm pretty
decent at making them


588
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:26,406
but I can't tell you how
many times I've made an icon


589
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:27,976
and I thought I did a
really good job with it


590
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:29,546
and then I showed it to someone


591
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:31,586
and they didn't know
what it meant.


592
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:33,696
It wasn't clear.


593
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:35,996
They guessed but
they guessed wrong.


594
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:41,136
And I suspect that it might be
the same with some of your apps.


595
00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:45,376
If you have icons in your
apps, you'll look at them


596
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:47,306
and you'll know exactly
what they do,


597
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:51,136
exactly what they represent,
but it's important to show them


598
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:55,196
to someone else who's never used
your app before and ask them,


599
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:57,586
tell them to tell you,
"What does this mean?"


600
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,316
What does this do?


601
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:01,226
You might be really surprised
to find the answers you get.


602
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,256
It's often more clear
to use text.


603
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:08,846
So for example this is
the Inbox icon that we had


604
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:10,326
in the previous version
of Calendar.


605
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:13,226
Sorry, I see people
craning their neck.


606
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:15,786
It's a little tray with
an arrow pointing to it.


607
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,626
Now this actually
is a good icon.


608
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:20,036
There's nothing wrong with it.


609
00:32:20,036 --> 00:32:23,366
It sort of extends
the Mail Inbox model,


610
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,686
we've always had
this tray for that.


611
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:30,866
But we have more space with
iOS 7 so it was much more clear


612
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,376
to present this command as text.


613
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:34,846
There's no ambiguity there.


614
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:39,446
Sorry, for those that can't
see it, it says Inbox in text.


615
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:44,676
And also just another thing,
in a bar like this it's better


616
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:47,626
to just have all
text or all icons.


617
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:50,346
If you mix the two it can
get kind of confusing.


618
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,116
All right, Notes.


619
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:59,846
I want to talk about
realism for a second.


620
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:02,166
This was Notes.


621
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:05,106
This was Notes from iOS 6


622
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:07,706
and actually all the way
back to the first phone.


623
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:13,116
And it had this really clear
notepad motif, this theme.


624
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,646
It looked like a
legal pad of paper.


625
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:18,836
And the team that made this
did a really good job of it.


626
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:21,636
It was a great attention
to detail, the textures,


627
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,896
the torn paper edges, the way
the lines there move slightly


628
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:28,136
over to the left to
convey the sense of depth,


629
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:31,346
the typeface that's legible,
the handwritten font,


630
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:35,226
the icons that were custom
designed to match the style


631
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:38,806
of the notepad and the way
the page curled as you went


632
00:33:38,906 --> 00:33:42,606
from the next to the previous
note or went through notes,


633
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:46,446
really sold the idea that
this was a legal pad.


634
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:50,536
But why? Why do this?


635
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:56,256
Well to explain that we
have to go back to 2007.


636
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:57,986
We're going to take
a trip back in time.


637
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:00,866
It's 2007, there is no iPhone,


638
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:02,546
you don't know what
multi-touch means,


639
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:05,336
you've never used
a device like this.


640
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:08,386
You haven't heard about swipe,
you haven't heard about pinch,


641
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:11,266
you haven't heard about rotate,
that's not in your lexicon,


642
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:14,376
it's not in your vocabulary,
you don't use those terms.


643
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:18,906
So when these apps were being
designed it was really important


644
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:22,815
that to make it easy,
to pick one of these up


645
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:26,065
and be successful with it,
accomplish tasks that you want


646
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,716
to accomplish, that it should
be immediately familiar.


647
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:33,456
So real world objects were used
as the basis for the app UI


648
00:34:33,545 --> 00:34:35,585
in a lot of the apps
that we saw.


649
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:38,896
A legal pad is so ordinary.


650
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,416
Everyone knows what it's for.


651
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,246
Everyone knows how to use it.


652
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:48,666
But sometimes when you use a
real world metaphor as the basis


653
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:51,136
for your UI it doesn't
really scale.


654
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:56,076
So for example, you
can't search a notepad.


655
00:34:57,085 --> 00:35:00,066
So when you add that it
starts to ruin the illusion.


656
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:01,886
Things start to breakdown.


657
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:05,726
So this is the new
design for Notes.


658
00:35:07,526 --> 00:35:09,946
It's so much more clear
what's important here.


659
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:11,786
It's the content of your notes.


660
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,416
That's front and center.


661
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,956
It's not about the
style of the app.


662
00:35:15,956 --> 00:35:19,696
It's not about showing you how
great you can represent a legal


663
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:20,456
pad of paper.


664
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:23,926
It's about what matters,
the Notes.


665
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:28,556
But you can still see that it's
been stylized, it has a theme


666
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,936
but that theme serves a
very different purpose now.


667
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:34,876
It's meant to impart warmth
and personality and character.


668
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:38,476
And great detail went into
making this just right.


669
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:40,706
We have this letterpress
text effect


670
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:44,196
and the paper texture
is really realistic.


671
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:47,696
You can see that
when you zoom in.


672
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:51,956
Now let's talk about clutter.


673
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:57,596
As you'll see there's
a difference here


674
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:58,956
between these two versions.


675
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,486
There's something missing in
iOS 7 and that's the title.


676
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:06,066
Now we've always advised
have a title for your screen,


677
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,686
have a title for your
screen, it's really important


678
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:10,746
and 99 percent of the time
it is really important


679
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,746
so don't just go remove your
titles with reckless abandon.


680
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:19,826
The title tells you where you
are and what you are looking at,


681
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:22,696
but did it matter here?


682
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:25,086
Notes is such a simple
application.


683
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,756
The name of the application
is its title.


684
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,926
It tells you what you're
going to be looking at here.


685
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:31,336
There's no ambiguity.


686
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:32,096
You don't know.


687
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:34,906
Those aren't emails
or something else.


688
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:35,816
These are notes.


689
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:39,206
So there is no point in
showing the title so we didn't.


690
00:36:41,596 --> 00:36:43,956
Same is true when you're
looking at an individual note.


691
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,476
Previously it was just generated
by the first line of text


692
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:47,946
so it was always
totally redundant.


693
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,646
What's the point of doing that?


694
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:52,316
There is none so the
title is removed.


695
00:36:52,956 --> 00:36:56,026
And one last thing
about Notes is color.


696
00:36:56,806 --> 00:37:00,286
Now you'll see that the color,
you'll see this yellow color


697
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,946
in Notes and that's the tint
color of the application.


698
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,256
That color serves
two purposes here.


699
00:37:05,526 --> 00:37:08,736
One, it indicates things that
are interactive and two it helps


700
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:10,946
to stylize the look and
appearance of your app.


701
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:14,976
Now you'll want to pick a
tint color for your iOS 7 app


702
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:17,186
and you'll probably pick
something that works well


703
00:37:17,186 --> 00:37:19,006
with your brand or
your app icon.


704
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:22,556
So if your logo has green
color, make a green tint.


705
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:24,886
You know any color is
going to work well.


706
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:31,266
You can use purple, red,
yellow, orange, green, blue,


707
00:37:31,346 --> 00:37:35,186
everything expect for
white, I don't know.


708
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:37,676
Let's move onto Safari.


709
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:41,246
So with Safari I want to
talk about iconography.


710
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:45,036
Now as you saw we've
redesigned all of our icons.


711
00:37:45,036 --> 00:37:50,896
So these five icons they look
visually different and that's


712
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:55,416
because they're five
of a huge set of icons


713
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:58,966
that were fully redesigned for
iOS 7 and they were redesigned


714
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:00,576
so that they matched each other.


715
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:04,196
They're straightforward,
front on,


716
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,566
they have thin delicate
line features, the curvature


717
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:09,656
of the shapes is
really consistent.


718
00:38:10,006 --> 00:38:11,616
A lot of care and thought went


719
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:14,066
into making this
system hang together.


720
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:18,206
Now I know a lot of you guys
don't make a couple dozen apps


721
00:38:18,206 --> 00:38:19,566
and whole operating system,


722
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:24,256
but even if in your app you
only have two icons you have


723
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:26,376
to make sure that they
work well together.


724
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:30,276
I can't tell you how many apps
I've seen in my experience


725
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:33,166
where icons just look
like they were pulled


726
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,516
from different sources or
made by different designers.


727
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:39,096
And the problem with that is it
makes your app look cluttered


728
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:43,836
and incoherent and we're
really sensitive to that.


729
00:38:43,836 --> 00:38:47,546
We have a really high bar
for that kind of consistency.


730
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:50,886
We've seen a lot of great
software in our time, all of us,


731
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:56,966
and so when we look at every app
we measure them against that.


732
00:38:57,176 --> 00:39:02,206
Now it wasn't sufficient to just
make icons match each other,


733
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:06,316
they also match the
clean, crisp typeface


734
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:07,906
that we use as a system font.


735
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,126
That's also really important.


736
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:13,806
We wanted to establish an
overall aesthetic for iOS 7


737
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,546
that really hung together well.


738
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:20,066
That also can apply, you know
let's say you're making an app


739
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,426
about the U.S. Constitution, you
don't want to use marker felt


740
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:26,366
with the parchment texture,
that would look really corny.


741
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,696
You want to pick a font
that's appropriate.


742
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,156
But although the style of
these icons has changed


743
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:35,356
so much has remained the same.


744
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:40,026
The symbology of the icons
is identical, arrows for back


745
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:42,596
and forward, open
book for bookmarks,


746
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:46,036
the order that they're in and
the location on the screen,


747
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:47,486
they've all stayed the same


748
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,806
so your muscle memory still
will serve you really well,


749
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:51,336
it's really familiar.


750
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:54,196
Let's move onto Weather.


751
00:39:54,196 --> 00:39:57,616
I want to talk about affordance.


752
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:03,116
Now this is a $5 word and I know
a lot of you know what it means


753
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:05,966
but I've heard different
definitions and for anyone


754
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,206
who doesn't know what it
means, let me define it just


755
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,536
so we all share a
common meaning for this.


756
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:14,306
So take a door for example.


757
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:15,686
If it has a handle on it,


758
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,996
it affords you the
ability to pull it.


759
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,006
If it doesn't have
a handle on it,


760
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:21,706
it affords you the
ability to push it.


761
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:24,806
All physical objects
have this quality.


762
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,786
They afford you a different
way of manipulating them,


763
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:29,156
of interacting with them.


764
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,146
We learn this stuff
from our earliest ages


765
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:34,696
of childhood development.


766
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:37,396
It's how we interface
with the world.


767
00:40:37,946 --> 00:40:40,586
So interface, it's
really important


768
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:42,676
in your user interface design
to think about this stuff


769
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:45,266
and be conscious of these
visual cues that we use


770
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:47,486
to understand how to
interact with things.


771
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:54,206
So with that in mind, I want
to draw your attention to this.


772
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:58,376
There's this blue rounded
rectangle in the background


773
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:01,276
of all this data that we saw in
the previous version of Weather


774
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:03,406
and it was there for a
very specific purpose.


775
00:41:03,406 --> 00:41:05,976
It looks a little
bit like a card,


776
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:08,846
like a playing card
right, business card.


777
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:11,946
The affordance of a
card when it's sitting


778
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:14,636
on a table is something that
you can take with one finger


779
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:19,026
and swipe it around, so it's
perfect to indicate to people


780
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:19,976
that they can do this.


781
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:25,526
And when it flips around
that feels natural.


782
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:26,706
Cards flip around.


783
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:28,696
It's really straight forward.


784
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,686
But there was a third
element which none


785
00:41:31,686 --> 00:41:34,126
of us were familiar with,
which is this page control.


786
00:41:34,716 --> 00:41:37,216
We had to learn the
meaning of that


787
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:38,926
and it was a really
easy thing to learn.


788
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:40,816
I mean it only takes
a couple minutes


789
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,816
but that didn't exist before.


790
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:50,636
So with that, do we need the
card to tell you you can swipe?


791
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,466
In fact, now swiping
is so natural for us


792
00:41:53,466 --> 00:41:55,646
when we use an iPhone or an iPad


793
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,456
that we just try to
swipe everything.


794
00:41:57,576 --> 00:41:58,546
We try to pinch everything,


795
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:01,066
rotate everything,
we play with it.


796
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:02,106
It feels comfortable.


797
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:04,026
We expect these gestures
to be there.


798
00:42:04,616 --> 00:42:06,506
We don't need it.


799
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:08,826
We got rid of it.


800
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,716
It was an unnecessary
ornamentation


801
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:13,916
and as a result there
was more space to use


802
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,376
for displaying what really
matters here, the information


803
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:18,876
about the current
weather conditions.


804
00:42:18,876 --> 00:42:21,966
It's amazing what taking
over that little amount


805
00:42:21,966 --> 00:42:28,066
of space accomplishes, 640
pixels to display data.


806
00:42:29,556 --> 00:42:32,376
So you can make text larger
and it be more legible.


807
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:34,836
You have room for
additional information


808
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,506
like the current
weather conditions.


809
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:39,976
Now that background does a
really good job of telling you


810
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:41,676
that it's snowing or it's
raining or it's going


811
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:42,906
to be sunny or whatever,


812
00:42:42,906 --> 00:42:48,216
but if there's any ambiguity
whatsoever, that text nails it,


813
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:50,856
Takes all the guesswork
out of it.


814
00:42:50,856 --> 00:42:54,856
So again information is
expressed as clearly as possible


815
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:57,106
and often times that's
done with text.


816
00:42:57,466 --> 00:43:02,306
As a result Weather is a simple,


817
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,786
beautiful app that's
really easy to use.


818
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,896
Its form serves its function.


819
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:10,876
It's a pure expression of it.


820
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:13,376
This is clarity in design.


821
00:43:13,906 --> 00:43:17,066
Let's move onto the Compass.


822
00:43:17,456 --> 00:43:23,876
Now I love the Compass app but I
want to start with a little bit


823
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:26,446
of discussion about realism.


824
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:29,286
Now this is going to be
a little bit redundant


825
00:43:29,286 --> 00:43:30,566
but I think this is
kind of important.


826
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:37,486
The previous version of
Compass looked like this kind


827
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:39,266
of nice looking thing
that you would find


828
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:40,966
on a yacht or something.


829
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:42,316
I don't know, I've
never been on one,


830
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:46,266
but it was really
carefully crafted


831
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:51,646
and it was really attractive,
pretty, but was it necessary


832
00:43:52,576 --> 00:43:53,526
to make it look like this


833
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:56,676
so that we would understand
how to use a compass?


834
00:43:57,256 --> 00:43:59,256
Was it necessary to
design it this way


835
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:02,146
so you understood
what this was for?


836
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:06,276
No. And did it limit what
was possible with Compass?


837
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:08,656
Yes. Let's look at why.


838
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:12,056
So in the center of the dial
there's this four points


839
00:44:12,056 --> 00:44:14,506
adornment and this
capstone and that took


840
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:15,816
up quite a bit of space.


841
00:44:16,876 --> 00:44:21,006
By getting rid of that we could
put a level right in the center.


842
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:23,676
That makes Compass more useful.


843
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,986
It's a direct tradeoff
between the desire


844
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:29,756
to have this ornamentation
and the desire


845
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,076
to have more functionality.


846
00:44:32,496 --> 00:44:33,976
So the decision is really clear.


847
00:44:35,476 --> 00:44:37,066
Making it more useful
is important.


848
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:44,226
As a result Compass
is clean it's elegant.


849
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:47,226
It's the expression of
what a Compass should be


850
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:51,066
on this device, not what a
compass should be on a boat.


851
00:44:55,536 --> 00:44:58,606
And also when you turn and
face a different direction,


852
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:02,426
the letters stay upright
so they're more legible.


853
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,996
Again, if we had done this
with the previous Compass,


854
00:45:06,446 --> 00:45:08,426
it would have totally
ruined the illusion.


855
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,166
Those two things are at
odds with each other.


856
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:15,996
A little bit more about color.


857
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,516
So you notice there's
this red color in Compass


858
00:45:18,956 --> 00:45:21,026
and there's something really
special about that red.


859
00:45:22,406 --> 00:45:26,996
That red is the same red
that we saw in Calendar.


860
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:28,816
It's the same red that
you'll see in Stocks.


861
00:45:28,816 --> 00:45:30,516
It's the same red that
you see in Stop Watch.


862
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:33,976
It's the same red you'll
find in a lot of places.


863
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:40,006
This color pallet was designed
to be carefully balanced


864
00:45:40,276 --> 00:45:42,676
to be clean and vibrant,
beautiful,


865
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:48,296
and our products use these
colors with great restraint.


866
00:45:49,476 --> 00:45:50,836
You don't want to
just arbitrarily pick


867
00:45:50,836 --> 00:45:52,266
different application.


868
00:45:52,266 --> 00:45:54,346
It makes things start to
fragment and fall apart,


869
00:45:54,406 --> 00:45:56,336
and that too applies
to your app.


870
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:59,426
If you use color, use
it with restraint.


871
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:03,266
Carefully select colors
that look really good


872
00:46:03,846 --> 00:46:07,106
and don't just arbitrarily pick
different colors at random.


873
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:12,376
It's going to make your UI
feel fragmented, incoherent.


874
00:46:14,976 --> 00:46:16,836
All right, Settings.


875
00:46:17,356 --> 00:46:19,136
Now Settings is a great
way to see how all


876
00:46:19,136 --> 00:46:21,426
of the UIKit controls
have changed.


877
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:25,156
So I encourage you to open
up Settings and play around


878
00:46:25,156 --> 00:46:26,396
and look at some of
the different controls


879
00:46:26,396 --> 00:46:34,946
that are there, but I want to
focus on three of those today.


880
00:46:35,176 --> 00:46:38,696
Switches. Now Switches
have changed a lot.


881
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:42,286
Instead of using text to show
you that the switch is off


882
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:47,606
or on, you see there's
just a nice solid color


883
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:49,556
which is expressing
that information.


884
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:55,006
And the reason why that can
work is because it's consistent


885
00:46:55,006 --> 00:46:57,936
with so many other controls
that you'll see in iOS 7.


886
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,716
Selection is shown in
this consistent way


887
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:05,696
so each control reinforces
how selection is indicated.


888
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:09,336
Date Pickers.


889
00:47:10,086 --> 00:47:11,296
Now these have changed
quite a bit.


890
00:47:12,486 --> 00:47:16,586
No longer do you see all of
this glossy, different colors


891
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:20,586
of blue, glass, inter-shadows,
highlights and all this stuff,


892
00:47:20,586 --> 00:47:21,726
all this ornamentation.


893
00:47:23,146 --> 00:47:26,156
What you see instead
is some clean text


894
00:47:26,436 --> 00:47:29,146
which has been distorted
in such a way to suggest


895
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,036
that these are printed
on wheels and because


896
00:47:32,036 --> 00:47:35,246
of that you get a sense that
you can just swipe these up


897
00:47:35,246 --> 00:47:36,876
and down to change the values.


898
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:40,876
Kind of relates to this
concept of continuation.


899
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:43,236
Our mind has to make sense of
why these are being distorted


900
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:45,346
and we make sense
of it by thinking


901
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:46,776
about then as being on a wheel.


902
00:47:47,356 --> 00:47:51,656
Now we don't need these
strong vertical dividing lines


903
00:47:51,726 --> 00:47:52,816
to separate the values.


904
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:56,166
A little bit of negative space
will do the trick just fine,


905
00:47:56,996 --> 00:48:00,746
and which value is selected
is really easy to see


906
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:01,906
because it's darker text,


907
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:04,066
it's right in the center,
it totally obvious.


908
00:48:04,106 --> 00:48:06,716
You don't need that blue glass


909
00:48:07,066 --> 00:48:09,206
to show you what the
current value is.


910
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:12,306
And as a result of
these changes,


911
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:14,826
it works really well inline.


912
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:20,236
You don't have to go to a
separate view to adjust the date


913
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:22,486
or adjust the value
of time in this case,


914
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,156
and that's important too.


915
00:48:27,436 --> 00:48:30,116
Going to a separate view
means you lose your context.


916
00:48:30,716 --> 00:48:32,986
Perhaps there's some
information in the previous view


917
00:48:33,216 --> 00:48:35,826
that you need to make
the decision in the view


918
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:37,876
that you've just gone to and now
you're going to have to go back


919
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,846
and forth and memorize.


920
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,136
Displaying something
inline allows you to stay


921
00:48:44,136 --> 00:48:46,406
in the context you were
in before and swiping up


922
00:48:46,406 --> 00:48:48,086
and down is really easy.


923
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,246
This is an example
of a simple design


924
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,806
that has tremendous depth.


925
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:56,446
And finally, Back buttons.


926
00:48:56,626 --> 00:49:00,686
Now, to get back previously you
would press on the Back button.


927
00:49:01,176 --> 00:49:04,746
That makes sense and you still
do that but now with the iPhone,


928
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:06,446
I don't have one on
me, I can't show you,


929
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:08,716
you swipe in from the left edge


930
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,356
and that allows you
to get back as well.


931
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,706
So let's look at how that works


932
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:16,876
but pay close attention
to the Back button.


933
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:21,136
See how it just slides over
and morphs into the title?


934
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:24,136
It's kind of an obvious thing.


935
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:25,616
So intuitive.


936
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:28,676
It clearly shows that
parent child relationship


937
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:31,436
and clearly shows you that
you're moving from one level


938
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:32,756
in the hierarchy to another.


939
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:35,066
It's really elegant.


940
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:36,606
I like it.


941
00:49:37,156 --> 00:49:38,716
All right, Control Center.


942
00:49:38,966 --> 00:49:41,466
Now, you've heard a lot about
Control Center, I'm not going


943
00:49:41,466 --> 00:49:44,136
to repeat all of that, but I
want to talk about layering.


944
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,686
We can see here we've brought up
Control Center and we're looking


945
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:50,016
at the very top of that
and we know that we're


946
00:49:50,016 --> 00:49:52,316
at the Home screen because
we can still see the app


947
00:49:52,316 --> 00:49:53,486
icons behind.


948
00:49:54,676 --> 00:49:57,346
That transparency it
provides this sense of depth


949
00:49:57,906 --> 00:50:01,786
and the colors coming through
just reinforces that sense


950
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:05,266
of depth, and that's
important because you bring


951
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:07,216
up the Control Center in all of
these different applications.


952
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:09,406
I brought it up here in Mail and
I know that I'm still in Mail


953
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,126
so when I dismiss the Control
Center I'm going to be back


954
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:16,186
in Mail or Compass or Calendar.


955
00:50:17,136 --> 00:50:18,556
My context is maintained.


956
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:21,066
And you guys can apply
that to your apps too.


957
00:50:21,066 --> 00:50:23,996
You can use layering
to bring in things


958
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:25,896
that people need quick access
to and then they're going


959
00:50:25,896 --> 00:50:27,886
to dismiss and go back to
where they were before,


960
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:29,916
but their context is maintained.


961
00:50:31,606 --> 00:50:32,606
It's really fluid.


962
00:50:32,756 --> 00:50:33,846
It makes things really easy.


963
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:36,166
And it just looks pretty.


964
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,486
All right, last but not
least, the Home screen.


965
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:45,586
Now as we saw, the Home screen
has remained structurally the


966
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:48,506
same as it was before
and why not?


967
00:50:48,506 --> 00:50:50,256
It's a really great interface.


968
00:50:50,576 --> 00:50:53,816
So all the interactions about
deleting app icons and swiping


969
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:55,566
between Home screens
and reordering and that,


970
00:50:55,746 --> 00:50:58,646
it's all the same, but
the icons have changed


971
00:50:58,646 --> 00:51:01,116
so we'll spend a little bit of
time talking about these icons.


972
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:06,726
Gone are the heaviest of
textures, the stripes,


973
00:51:07,216 --> 00:51:12,506
the light rays, the glossy
overlays and the photo realism.


974
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:18,756
The Safari icon, for example,
has been greatly simplified.


975
00:51:19,756 --> 00:51:23,366
Safari is represented by a
compass and it doesn't take much


976
00:51:23,476 --> 00:51:26,516
to communicate the concept of a
compass, to depict that image.


977
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:30,476
All you need is a red and
white needle, circular dial


978
00:51:30,476 --> 00:51:31,536
and maybe some tick marks.


979
00:51:31,646 --> 00:51:32,126
That's it.


980
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,836
If you start to add other stuff
it becomes busy and heavy.


981
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:38,896
So you don't need the
cardinal directions


982
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,236
of North, East, South and West.


983
00:51:40,236 --> 00:51:41,876
You don't need the
globe background.


984
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:43,096
You don't need the
glossy overlay.


985
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:45,226
You don't need the
specular highlights


986
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:47,446
and the drop shadows
and all that stuff.


987
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:52,216
The result is a cleaner shape
that's easier to identify.


988
00:51:52,426 --> 00:51:53,006
It's simpler.


989
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:55,966
There's less stuff
coming at you.


990
00:51:56,796 --> 00:51:59,866
And when you see this along
a bunch of other app icons


991
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:00,576
that all have a bunch


992
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,686
of ornamentation it
becomes hard to find stuff.


993
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:05,996
Now we've been providing
this advice for some time now


994
00:52:06,076 --> 00:52:07,956
and now we're kind
of listening to it.


995
00:52:08,176 --> 00:52:10,646
It's really nice
to find a clean,


996
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:13,266
simple shape and just one color.


997
00:52:13,696 --> 00:52:15,786
Makes app icons stand
out really well.


998
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:19,836
And of course the color that's
chosen matches the tint color


999
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:20,756
from the applications.


1000
00:52:21,686 --> 00:52:23,286
You want to have that
kind of consistency.


1001
00:52:29,676 --> 00:52:32,886
Now, many of you might ask,
well, if you're simplifying,


1002
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,336
getting rid of all
this ornamentation,


1003
00:52:34,336 --> 00:52:35,096
what about the gradients?


1004
00:52:35,096 --> 00:52:36,766
Why don't you just
use a solid color?


1005
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:37,956
That's going to be
a lot simpler.


1006
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:43,306
Well, perhaps, but it turns
out it's also really boring.


1007
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:46,716
Vibrancy, life, that's
important.


1008
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:48,806
Those are really
important values


1009
00:52:48,806 --> 00:52:51,766
and these gradients they add
that but in a subtle way,


1010
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:55,046
but it still makes it so much
more visually interesting.


1011
00:52:56,956 --> 00:53:00,146
Now these icons they're
simpler but the approach


1012
00:53:00,146 --> 00:53:01,916
to designing them
wasn't simplistic.


1013
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:05,456
So to demonstrate, I'm going to
replay that video that we saw


1014
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:06,166
at the very beginning.


1015
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:22,656
[ Silence ]


1016
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:24,286
It's kind of a nice video.


1017
00:53:25,556 --> 00:53:30,266
All of our app icons were
designed using this grid,


1018
00:53:30,446 --> 00:53:34,746
this template, to give them
consistency and composition.


1019
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:37,726
So they're connected at
this really deep level.


1020
00:53:39,226 --> 00:53:42,126
This template, it's
really balanced.


1021
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:44,886
I spent some time
recreating this and I got


1022
00:53:44,886 --> 00:53:48,606
to appreciate the subtlety of it
and why all the lines are placed


1023
00:53:48,606 --> 00:53:50,626
where they are and how
the circles work with that


1024
00:53:51,986 --> 00:53:53,726
and it's sophisticated stuff.


1025
00:53:54,116 --> 00:53:54,666
It's kind of cool.


1026
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:55,486
I was impressed.


1027
00:53:56,036 --> 00:54:02,416
But as a result of following
this template our icons share


1028
00:54:02,796 --> 00:54:06,236
things like this blue dot
in Stocks aligns perfectly


1029
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:08,256
with the corner of
that intersection.


1030
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:14,756
The circular shape of the
Safari icon matches perfectly


1031
00:54:15,746 --> 00:54:19,136
with the iTunes Store
icon and the Photos icon.


1032
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:24,006
Alright I'm running low on time
so I want to go quickly forward.


1033
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:26,916
One thing to point out, you guys
should all be aware of this,


1034
00:54:27,006 --> 00:54:28,716
the app icons are now
a little bit bigger,


1035
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:31,176
so you don't want
your icons to scale,


1036
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:35,616
be best to deliver all work
at this size, 120 by 120.


1037
00:54:36,636 --> 00:54:39,316
So all of these icons
they have colors,


1038
00:54:39,316 --> 00:54:40,346
they have different features,


1039
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:43,036
but everything was done
with great restraint.


1040
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:46,836
If it didn't help to communicate
the meaning of the app,


1041
00:54:47,106 --> 00:54:49,576
what its function
was, it was removed.


1042
00:54:49,576 --> 00:54:51,826
If it didn't help to
differentiate one icon


1043
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:54,406
from the next and help them
stand out, it was removed.


1044
00:54:55,336 --> 00:54:57,646
And as a result it's a
simpler set of icons.


1045
00:54:58,126 --> 00:54:59,056
It's easier on the eye.


1046
00:54:59,706 --> 00:55:02,386
So some final thoughts.


1047
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:09,716
The values that were at the
heart of iOS 7 were clarity,


1048
00:55:10,526 --> 00:55:13,706
deference, depth and detail.


1049
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,146
Let's talk about
those because I think


1050
00:55:17,886 --> 00:55:20,656
if you guys take anything away
from today it should be this.


1051
00:55:20,956 --> 00:55:22,866
It's really powerful stuff.


1052
00:55:23,956 --> 00:55:28,696
Clarity. We saw what
clarity meant in Compass.


1053
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,966
It meant doing nothing more
than showing you information


1054
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:34,376
and express functionality.


1055
00:55:35,556 --> 00:55:38,026
Nothing more and nothing less.


1056
00:55:41,536 --> 00:55:42,546
Deference.


1057
00:55:44,036 --> 00:55:48,926
Deference in Mail meant making
sure that text is large,


1058
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:56,176
resizable, legible and
gorgeous, and photos are large


1059
00:55:56,646 --> 00:56:02,576
so you can see the detail.


1060
00:56:04,296 --> 00:56:06,206
Depth. Now I didn't
show this before


1061
00:56:06,766 --> 00:56:09,206
but I think this is really
cool so let's look at this now.


1062
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:13,856
When you swipe up to see
the Camera and you let go,


1063
00:56:14,296 --> 00:56:15,616
see it bounces a little bit?


1064
00:56:15,996 --> 00:56:18,786
And it bounces differently based
on the height you drop in from.


1065
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:21,736
You can even slam it down
and it really bounces.


1066
00:56:22,266 --> 00:56:28,136
That provides such a
sense of physical realism.


1067
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,736
Makes it so much more
lifelike and believable.


1068
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:33,216
You guys could do that too.


1069
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,766
UI Dynamics, with
its physics engine,


1070
00:56:35,766 --> 00:56:39,266
is going to really enable people
to do some amazing stuff here.


1071
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:44,746
The Home screen and the
way we have these distinct,


1072
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:47,456
functional planes that are
separated from each other


1073
00:56:47,456 --> 00:56:53,326
and respond to the
movement of the device.


1074
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,676
And detail, detail
brings it all together.


1075
00:57:00,496 --> 00:57:02,526
So you've seen what
it meant for us.


1076
00:57:03,426 --> 00:57:06,506
You've seen what these
new tools allowed Apple


1077
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:10,406
to do with apps in iOS 7.


1078
00:57:11,236 --> 00:57:15,126
How are your apps going
to have more depth?


1079
00:57:15,646 --> 00:57:19,616
How can you use behaviors and
motion effects and transitions


1080
00:57:20,196 --> 00:57:24,796
and layering to improve the
experience of your apps?


1081
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:28,566
How are you going to be more
deferential in your apps?


1082
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:30,916
What do users care about most?


1083
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,026
What's the content that's
most important to them?


1084
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:35,386
How can you get out
of their way?


1085
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:37,846
And clarity.


1086
00:57:38,546 --> 00:57:40,406
What's the functionality
of your app?


1087
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:42,896
What's the information
you're trying to express?


1088
00:57:43,236 --> 00:57:45,476
How can you do a
better job of that?


1089
00:57:46,026 --> 00:57:47,326
How can you prioritize things


1090
00:57:47,326 --> 00:57:50,966
and make things simpler
for people?


1091
00:57:51,126 --> 00:57:54,006
Now, this is a really
exciting time


1092
00:57:54,746 --> 00:57:58,196
to be doing interface design and
talking about it and thinking


1093
00:57:58,196 --> 00:58:01,026
about it, for you
developers making apps.


1094
00:58:02,056 --> 00:58:06,416
There's some amazing new tools
in iOS 7 and we've applied those


1095
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:09,896
to the apps that ship
with the devices.


1096
00:58:10,656 --> 00:58:12,586
But we're just scratching
the surface.


1097
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:18,446
There's 800,000 apps in the App
Store, 6 million developers,


1098
00:58:19,126 --> 00:58:22,756
some of the brightest minds
in the world are spending all


1099
00:58:22,756 --> 00:58:25,356
of their time, you guys,
you're spending all


1100
00:58:25,356 --> 00:58:27,126
of your time using all
of that brain power


1101
00:58:27,126 --> 00:58:29,096
to do some amazing
things with your apps.


1102
00:58:29,846 --> 00:58:32,266
What are you going to
do with this stuff?


1103
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:35,616
It's really exciting because
we're at the precipice of that.


1104
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,806
We're at the beginning
of a whole new phase


1105
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,866
of software development
for mobile devices.


1106
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:46,276
I have no idea what you're going
to make but I know it's going


1107
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:49,616
to be awesome and I'm
really looking forward


1108
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:51,396
to when we come back
together next year


1109
00:58:51,686 --> 00:58:54,236
and seeing what was done
over the course of that year.


1110
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:56,356
It's going to be mind-blowing.


1111
00:58:57,556 --> 00:59:00,576
So go out there,
make some cool stuff


1112
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:02,726
and let's regroup in a year.


1113
00:59:03,236 --> 00:59:04,426
Thank you very much.
