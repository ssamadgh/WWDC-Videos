00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,506
>> From first launch to your

2
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:23,866
tutorial through your user

3
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,736
interface, there's a lot that

4
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:27,446
people experience in addition to

5
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:28,596
your games' gameplay.

6
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,456
So, in the next few minutes, I'm

7
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:32,586
going to cover 10 design tips to

8
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:35,536
create great experiences as soon

9
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,186
as someone taps your app icon,

10
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:39,636
and many of these tips can be

11
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,206
applied to apps that are looking

12
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,526
to be just as immersive,

13
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:44,136
engaging, and fun.

14
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:45,526
So, let's start.

15
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:48,066
First up is first launch.

16
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,456
This is the first experience

17
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:52,426
people have with your game and

18
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:53,736
your first impression matters.

19
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:55,476
So, no matter what you need to

20
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:57,216
say first, whether it is Accept

21
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:59,586
Terms, or Headsets Recommended,

22
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,666
design the first screen to fit

23
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,175
within the style of your game.

24
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,166
That way, they're immersed

25
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:05,985
immediately.

26
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,056
This edge to edge illustration

27
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,806
from Pokemon Go does a great

28
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:11,886
job, and it communicates just as

29
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:13,536
much as the text on screen.

30
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:16,646
So, take the time to design what

31
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:18,126
people see first as soon as they

32
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:18,936
launch your game.

33
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:21,016
When this is done well, it'll

34
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:22,396
make a lasting impression and

35
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,636
set the tone for the rest of

36
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:24,146
your game.

37
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,466
Next is loading because

38
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,906
sometimes it takes just a few

39
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:30,326
seconds to pull data through

40
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:30,926
space.

41
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,956
So, then why not take advantage

42
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:34,436
of what we all know to be true,

43
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,906
time flies when you're having

44
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:37,316
fun.

45
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:40,146
So, during loading, make it fun

46
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,086
by educating or entertaining;

47
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,996
then, loading won't see to take

48
00:01:43,996 --> 00:01:44,596
as long.

49
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,666
This is Don't Starve Pocket

50
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,546
Edition, and in this game

51
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,146
loading is masked by this

52
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:52,856
beautifully creepy animation,

53
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:54,856
players are entertained, and

54
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,366
time seems to fly by.

55
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,926
Loading is also a great time to

56
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:00,396
educate.

57
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:02,706
In Clash Royale, as you prepare

58
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,846
for battle, a game play tip is

59
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:05,866
shown on screen.

60
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,836
Now, if you choose to do this,

61
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:09,416
make sure that players have

62
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,756
enough time to read the tip and

63
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,306
also be intelligent about what

64
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:14,056
you show people.

65
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:15,776
If someone's already seen a tip,

66
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:17,226
don't repeat it in the same

67
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:17,776
session.

68
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,076
And finally, to show loading

69
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,206
progress, always favor progress

70
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:24,036
bars over activity indicators

71
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:25,506
because they do a much better

72
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:26,696
job communicating what's

73
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:28,326
happening and how long it will

74
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:28,656
take.

75
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:30,536
So, no matter when your game

76
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:32,876
needs to load, entertain,

77
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,326
educate, and show progress.

78
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:37,166
All right.

79
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,016
Next is Quick Start.

80
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,286
Being able to start quickly and

81
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,226
jump into your game is key to a

82
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:44,666
great game experience.

83
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:47,366
This is INKS, and it's an Apple

84
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,896
Design Award winner from last

85
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:49,156
year.

86
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,106
It's really fun that you're able

87
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:52,526
to get a feeling for the game

88
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:54,486
right from launch, but also they

89
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,256
do a great job making it obvious

90
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,596
on how to start the game with

91
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:58,946
this large turquoise Play

92
00:02:58,946 --> 00:02:59,316
button.

93
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,706
And as soon as you tap it, there

94
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:03,306
are only two screens before

95
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:04,846
you're in and playing the game,

96
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,146
which is awesome.

97
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,076
So, let people get into your

98
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:10,066
game easily and quickly.

99
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:12,396
Don't ask players to make too

100
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:13,526
many choices before they

101
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,096
understand what it means in your

102
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:15,505
game.

103
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,226
And for more complex games, I

104
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:19,336
know there are important things

105
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:20,146
that you want to show your

106
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,656
players, and game Main Menus

107
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,296
have become increasingly busy

108
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:27,026
with news, tournaments, stores,

109
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:29,016
and more, and these can all be

110
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:29,796
on your interface.

111
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,986
But make sure that the main call

112
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:34,876
to action to play, start,

113
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:37,716
battle, or begin a new game is

114
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,266
the most dominant in your Main

115
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:39,816
Menu UI.

116
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:41,986
All right.

117
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,526
Tip 4 is all about our game's

118
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:45,976
interface, and before we jump

119
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,866
into this tip, you should know

120
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:50,276
something about me, and that's,

121
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,246
I have a soft spot for classic

122
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:53,016
arcade games.

123
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:56,136
So, this fake alien monster game

124
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,556
is going to help us with a few

125
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:59,326
user interface best practices,

126
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,866
starting with consistency.

127
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,916
Consistency improves usability

128
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,926
because it helps people mentally

129
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:08,866
map your interface.

130
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,216
It's much easier to play and

131
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,786
navigate when controls are in

132
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:13,926
predictable locations.

133
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,146
So, be consistent in the layout

134
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:17,236
of your game's menu.

135
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:19,116
That way, people can spend their

136
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:21,006
energy playing you game versus

137
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,896
trying to recall where was that

138
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,626
Settings button.

139
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:25,966
So, let's look at the exact same

140
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,826
flow with an inconsistent UI.

141
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,176
The Back button is all over the

142
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:33,526
place, and Settings disappears

143
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:35,066
on the Choose Character screen.

144
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:38,366
This inconsistency disrupts a

145
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,436
player's experience because it

146
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:42,066
takes more effort to mentally

147
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:42,916
map the interface.

148
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:45,016
So, when you're designing, to

149
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,726
accommodate for consistency, lay

150
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:48,496
out all of your screens and

151
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,096
check them.

152
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:50,816
That way, you'll be able to tell

153
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,346
whether controls are in the same

154
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:52,636
place.

155
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:56,486
Okay. The next UI best practice

156
00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:57,806
is all about clarity.

157
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,126
It needs to be clear to players

158
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:01,436
what's interactive and what's

159
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:01,836
not.

160
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,586
If people have to think too much

161
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,316
about what to tap, they're going

162
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,376
to be taken out of your game's

163
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:07,106
experience.

164
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,976
So, items that are tappable need

165
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,916
to look different from items

166
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:11,846
that are not tappable.

167
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:13,936
So, in the top center of this

168
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:16,396
screen, my Lives is actually

169
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:17,336
just Status.

170
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,026
But with this visual appearance,

171
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,106
it could be confused for

172
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:21,476
something that's interactive.

173
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:23,276
This is common in a lot of

174
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:24,836
games, and there is an easy fix.

175
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,156
Make non-interactive elements

176
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,716
look different by using color

177
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:31,416
and shape, like this or this.

178
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,226
Or you can remove and put status

179
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:35,886
items away from interactive

180
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:36,436
elements.

181
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,216
In your interface, for clarity,

182
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:41,106
it's important always to include

183
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:43,156
three visual states for buttons

184
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,566
and controls because a lack of

185
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:46,906
visual feedback can confuse

186
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:47,356
players.

187
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,126
Be sure to use a normal state to

188
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,126
show people that something's

189
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:51,656
tappable.

190
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:54,366
Use a press state when something

191
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,866
has been tapped.

192
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,436
And finally, use a disabled

193
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:58,786
state for control that's not

194
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:00,536
currently active or enabled.

195
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,626
Many developers struggle if they

196
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,646
should remove or hide a control

197
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:07,886
if it cannot be activated, but

198
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,936
if you do that, when it does pop

199
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,096
back it could be really

200
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,366
confusing to players, especially

201
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,746
if this happens during gameplay.

202
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:17,296
So, for a much better user

203
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,926
experience, use a disabled

204
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:19,296
state.

205
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,966
This lets people know the

206
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:23,086
controls location and action

207
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,526
that will be possible soon when

208
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:25,736
that control is enabled.

209
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,206
And finally, make sure that

210
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,726
everything that's interactive on

211
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,106
your game's interface meets the

212
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:33,536
minimum tap targets on IOS for

213
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:35,366
just 44 by 44 points.

214
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,436
Your interface is a tool to make

215
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:40,616
sense of your game's world, so

216
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:42,326
make it consistent and clear.

217
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,156
That way, people will be able to

218
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:45,776
stay engaged in your game.

219
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:47,316
All right.

220
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,696
I hope you all enjoy that fake

221
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:49,586
alien monster game.

222
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:51,036
It'll come back in a bit to help

223
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,076
us with a few other design tips.

224
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,026
We're already halfway through at

225
00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:56,776
Number 5.

226
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:58,956
This tip and the next few are

227
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:00,436
about game tutorials.

228
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:02,656
Successful tutorials teach

229
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,376
gradually and in context through

230
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:05,446
progressive disclosure.

231
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:07,746
Your tutorial should be made up

232
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:09,836
of three basic parts that align

233
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:11,476
to the core loop of your game.

234
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,206
For example, it might be that

235
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:16,166
you have to fight monsters to

236
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,096
get some gold, and then buy some

237
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,166
stuff to fight more challenging

238
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:20,696
monsters.

239
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:24,066
But be sure, in your tutorial,

240
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,916
it stays to those three basic

241
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:26,426
parts.

242
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:28,946
If you have to keep, if you have

243
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:30,666
to teach about economy in your

244
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,405
game, keep it simple because,

245
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:34,716
remember, you're teaching

246
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,236
somebody something brand new.

247
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:39,346
So, avoid overwhelming people

248
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,636
and including information in

249
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:41,976
your tutorial that is not

250
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,086
essential to gameplay.

251
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,446
All of this, such as upgrades,

252
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:48,206
tournaments, messages, and your

253
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,436
store, can all be discovered

254
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:51,556
after your tutorial.

255
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:54,386
And also, in your tutorial, it's

256
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,826
really important to provide

257
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,046
clear direction.

258
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:59,316
If you have characters in your

259
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,236
game, it's pretty common to have

260
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:02,736
a character walk you through the

261
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:03,346
tutorial.

262
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:05,596
So, let's say we have this

263
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:08,636
adorable alien monster, keep

264
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,796
directions short and simple to

265
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:11,466
be effective.

266
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:13,546
So, whether you teach with a

267
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:16,056
character or through in-game

268
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,026
instructional text, a single

269
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:19,206
clear direction is going to be

270
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,166
the most effective.

271
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,776
And please, don't repeat

272
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:23,476
directions.

273
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:26,156
Respect your players and treat,

274
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,286
and don't treat them like

275
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:27,836
children.

276
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:29,946
Even if your players are

277
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:31,266
children, kids are smart.

278
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:33,476
So, repeating directions

279
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:35,296
unnecessarily lengthens your

280
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:37,406
tutorial, and that makes it less

281
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:38,856
effective and less fun.

282
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:41,466
And learning is really fun,

283
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:42,806
especially when the teacher is

284
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:45,556
engaging, creative, and

285
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,116
inventive.

286
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,106
So, be the cool teacher.

287
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,946
Don't just do what you've seen

288
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,586
others do.

289
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:52,606
If your game is unique, your

290
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:53,796
tutorial should be too.

291
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,546
For example, think about how you

292
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:58,126
can teach before your game

293
00:08:58,126 --> 00:08:58,656
begins.

294
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,886
This is Splitter Critters, and

295
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,936
in this game you split the world

296
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:05,546
with a swipe of your finger and

297
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,706
then rearrange it to guide

298
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:07,596
critters back to their

299
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:08,166
spaceship.

300
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:10,036
And from the Start screen,

301
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:11,596
you're taught this key game

302
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:12,156
mechanic.

303
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,816
And one of the least effective

304
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:16,676
ways to teach is with a bouncing

305
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:17,096
arrow.

306
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:20,636
It's not effective because

307
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,136
people just end up playing tap

308
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:23,666
the pointing arrow game and not

309
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,136
learning.

310
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:26,326
And the same goes for the

311
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,056
floating hand.

312
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:29,556
Not only do you not learn, but

313
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:30,616
this method is really

314
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,236
problematic because it hides you

315
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:33,246
from the interface that you're

316
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:34,746
trying to be learning about.

317
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,086
So, there are much better

318
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,516
attention-getting devices that

319
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:39,836
are way more natural and

320
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:42,096
immersive, such as animation.

321
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:46,066
This is Reigns, and I was really

322
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,116
excited to hear that the

323
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,886
developer is soon updating to

324
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,156
remove the floating hand.

325
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:52,876
On the right, is the new

326
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,676
experience and, as you can see,

327
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,596
it's much more immersive; it's

328
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,466
just as effective, and it does a

329
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,096
great job getting you right into

330
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,656
the world of Reigns, and being

331
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,856
in the world of your game is the

332
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:05,146
best.

333
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:07,836
So, if you could let people jump

334
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,166
right in and learn through play,

335
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:11,846
that is going to be the most

336
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:13,686
effective way to teach them your

337
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:14,086
game.

338
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:17,716
So, this is Mars: Mars on Apple

339
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,166
TV, and it's really fun to be

340
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,286
able to jump right into the

341
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:21,636
game.

342
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:24,236
So, right now, I'm on Mars, and

343
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:25,446
the controls are intuitive, so

344
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:26,266
I'm going to start clicking

345
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,846
around, and after one hilarious

346
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,976
death, I quickly realize that

347
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,096
the objective is to land safely

348
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:34,976
on the stations.

349
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,456
So, for the best experience,

350
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,976
teach people through play.

351
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,276
All right.

352
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,866
We're already at Number 9, which

353
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:47,836
is all about letting people skip

354
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,476
and get right into your game.

355
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:52,246
Give the player control, and

356
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:54,266
that way skip can create a much

357
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:55,726
better user experience.

358
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,676
Now, I love this opening

359
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:00,336
sequence from Icycle: On Thin

360
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:00,866
Ice.

361
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,046
It's clever, has a striking

362
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,456
style, and it provides you with

363
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,686
the motivation of the main

364
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:07,016
character, Dennis.

365
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,286
But when you tap on the screen,

366
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,896
a very subtle Skip button

367
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:13,916
appears, and that is great

368
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,186
because revealing Skip on tap is

369
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,236
a wonderful technique.

370
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:19,386
Players who are ready to jump

371
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,466
right into your game can, and

372
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:22,646
people who want to watch the

373
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,186
entire sequence can stay

374
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:25,316
immersed with edge to edge

375
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:25,686
playback.

376
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,316
Now, letting players skip also

377
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,026
applies to tutorials.

378
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,326
This is Zombie Gunship, and

379
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,456
check out the upper left-hand

380
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:35,866
corner.

381
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:37,166
It's awesome.

382
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,746
There is a Skip Tutorial button,

383
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:40,416
and it feels great to be able to

384
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,776
jump right into the game.

385
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,946
Just be sure if you allow people

386
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:46,746
to skip your tutorial, they're

387
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,676
able to relaunch or replay the

388
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,116
tutorial in case they need a

389
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,146
refresher on the rules.

390
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,696
Now, I understand that this may

391
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,166
not work for every game.

392
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:56,886
So, if it's critical to your

393
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,716
game's progression to include a

394
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,576
tutorial level, teach the

395
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:03,166
basics, gradually adding context

396
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,386
through progressive disclosure,

397
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:06,016
and then get out of the way.

398
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,676
Letting players skip is about

399
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,296
putting the player's experience

400
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,706
first because you don't know

401
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:16,496
someone's skill level or how

402
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:17,956
much time they have to play your

403
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:18,376
game.

404
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:21,796
And I'm sure we have all button

405
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:23,396
smashed and clicked as quickly

406
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:24,596
as possible to get through a

407
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,026
tutorial just to get into the

408
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:26,446
game.

409
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,546
So, for a much better user

410
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:31,166
experience, provide a Skip

411
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,076
Tutorial button.

412
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:36,166
So, respect the player and that

413
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,936
way, they will be able to have a

414
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,446
much better user experience.

415
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:43,256
The final design tip today is

416
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:44,756
about being inclusive.

417
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,626
There's a lot that you can do to

418
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:49,696
make your game more accessible,

419
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,676
such as adding closed captions

420
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,276
or supporting dynamic type.

421
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:55,956
You can also, just like in

422
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,946
Mushroom 11, support Left and

423
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,546
Right-Hand Mode, or you can

424
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,156
support Color Blind Mode, like

425
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:04,066
in Kami 2.

426
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:05,926
And one of the coolest

427
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:07,246
accessibility updates that I

428
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,046
have seen is from Blackbox,

429
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,506
which is a visual puzzler that

430
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,366
now includes sonic interfaces to

431
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,146
let players with low or no

432
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:16,666
vision play through solving

433
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,766
puzzles with sound.

434
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:21,256
With 285 million blind or

435
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:22,576
low-vision people in the world,

436
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:24,366
everybody should be able to play

437
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:27,856
games and have fun.

438
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:28,476
All right.

439
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,096
With these 10 design tips,

440
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:31,496
you'll be able to create great

441
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:34,386
experiences from the moment

442
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,076
someone taps your icon.

443
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,796
But remember, of all things,

444
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:41,276
respect you players, include

445
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:42,836
everyone, and put their

446
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:43,746
experience first.

447
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:43,946
Thank you.
