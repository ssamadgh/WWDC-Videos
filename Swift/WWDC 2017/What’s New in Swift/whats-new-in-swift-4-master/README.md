# What’s new in Swift 4

An Xcode playground showcasing the new features in Swift 4.0. As seen in the [What’s New in Swift session at WWDC 2017][WWDC 2017 402].

Written by [Ole Begemann][Ole Begemann], May–September 2017.

The playground requires Swift 4. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 9 includes Swift 4 by default.

You can also run it in Xcode 8.3, but you need to install [the latest Swift 4.0 snapshot from swift.org][Snapshot downloads] (don’t worry, it’s easy).
