00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,436
>> So hello everyone.


4
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,086
My name is Doug LeMoine.


5
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:40,596
My background is in interaction


6
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:41,246
design.


7
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,266
And here at Apple I'm on a team


8
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,046
of people who works with


9
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,206
developers like you.


10
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:49,146
As a designer I focus on user


11
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:51,296
interfaces and the ideas to


12
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:54,636
deliver great user experiences


13
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,226
to the people who use your apps.


14
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:58,976
Today I'm here to talk about


15
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:00,256
intent.


16
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,386
I think there's a thread running


17
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:05,476
through great apps and really


18
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:06,566
great products.


19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,586
And it has to do with a


20
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:11,556
conscious focus on people, on


21
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:14,476
humans, and what they want and


22
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:16,266
what they really need.


23
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:19,356
So I'm going to talk about


24
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:21,096
focusing on the person you want


25
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:21,616
to serve.


26
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:24,726
And I'm going to focus on being


27
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:25,586
intentional.


28
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,716
The intent that I'm interested


29
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:29,236
in talking about today is less


30
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:32,326
about a specific design vision


31
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:36,376
or a specific outcome and more


32
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:37,756
on a mindset.


33
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,286
How to keep a sharp focus on


34
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:41,896
those people that you're trying


35
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:44,976
to reach and create apps that


36
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:45,756
feel simple.


37
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:48,176
And when an app feels simple


38
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:52,566
users perceive it as natural, an


39
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:54,126
extension of what they know.


40
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,896
It feels like it arises from


41
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:58,486
their experience and it flows


42
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,316
naturally from what they expect.


43
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:04,196
So I know simple and natural are


44
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:06,546
sort of designer cliches, we say


45
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:07,796
this stuff all the time.


46
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,256
Like, what do we mean?


47
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,306
I think these terms are


48
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,846
shorthand for discussing


49
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,516
qualities of apps that create


50
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,836
feelings of comfort and


51
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:18,706
confidence.


52
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,586
When people feel comfortable and


53
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:23,626
confident, when we understand


54
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:25,276
how a thing works, we can move


55
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,176
through it seamlessly without


56
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:29,706
needed to learn or figure it


57
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:30,946
out.


58
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:32,716
So intent is the kind of thing


59
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,786
is hard to define but you know


60
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:35,496
it when you see it.


61
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,356
So I'm going to show you some


62
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,746
examples of apps that I found in


63
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:41,876
the last year that really


64
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,026
deliver real value to people and


65
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:45,166
really connect with them.


66
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,236
And I'm going to talk about five


67
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:50,296
elements of intentional design


68
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,246
that we can learn from these


69
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:52,736
apps and that you can apply to


70
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:53,146
your work.


71
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,766
So let's dive in.


72
00:02:57,926 --> 00:02:59,876
So before mobile devices came


73
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:01,516
around when you traveled abroad


74
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:02,706
you'd carry a paper map.


75
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,566
And the advantage of the paper


76
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:06,836
map is that when you would


77
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:08,736
approach a local they would


78
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:10,916
instantly recognize what kind of


79
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,826
help you needed.


80
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:15,306
So mobile maps have made people


81
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:16,826
more independent, right?


82
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:18,816
We probably approach fewer


83
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:20,466
locals when we're traveling


84
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:20,936
abroad.


85
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,136
But in the same way that a paper


86
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,646
map invites an interaction,


87
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,586
there's an app called iTranslate


88
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,336
Converse that makes it easy to


89
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,036
approach a local with your


90
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,766
iPhone in your hand to ask a


91
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,596
question or get directions.


92
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,486
Some of you may have seen this


93
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,126
on Monday night at the Apple


94
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,126
Design Awards.


95
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,666
I'm going to go through a demo


96
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,216
to really bring out what I think


97
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,056
is really intentional about this


98
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:46,316
app.


99
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,786
So first of all there's very


100
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:49,386
little UI.


101
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:51,736
The screen is essentially one


102
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:51,976
big button.


103
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,046
I tap and hold and start


104
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:55,536
talking.


105
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:56,416
So I'll show you that in a


106
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:56,896
second.


107
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,506
And to be clear the goal of


108
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:02,336
iTranslate Converse is to make


109
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:03,516
conversation easy.


110
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:05,596
The developers have intended


111
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,966
this app to be used together.


112
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,586
So two people together, one of


113
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:11,926
whom most likely has never used


114
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:13,686
this app before, probably never


115
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,676
even seen it.


116
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,736
So I launched this app really


117
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,696
for real in in the Naples train


118
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:23,106
station when I was trying to get


119
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:25,276
on an express train to Rome and


120
00:04:25,276 --> 00:04:26,216
the platforms were really


121
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:26,996
confusing.


122
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:29,226
So I pulled out my phone, I


123
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,546
launched the app, and I walked


124
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:31,926
up to a conductor.


125
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:34,816
So I said is this the express


126
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:35,776
train to Rome?

[Computerized Speaking Italian]


128
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:42,076
>> The app translated it into


129
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:44,996
Italian and the conductor heard.


130
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:47,956
Then I could flip the phone


131
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,786
around and again, what I find


132
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,136
interesting in this situation


133
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,236
that other person has probably


134
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:56,586
never seen this app before.


135
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:00,856
And they speak in a language


136
00:05:00,906 --> 00:05:02,376
that I didn't speak but the app


137
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,056
is smart enough to know that


138
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,466
it's ether going to English or


139
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,396
Italian to listen for.


140
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,336
So the conductor spoke into the


141
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:11,036
microphone.


142
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:13,666
>> Platform Nine.


143
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:16,226
>> And the app translates it for


144
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:16,356
me.


145
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:20,346
So in reality he spoke English.


146
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,516
[ Laughter ]


147
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:26,856
[ Applause ]


148
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:29,166
But he did want to see how the


149
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,206
app worked and I showed him and


150
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:31,916
he was impressed.


151
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:35,876
I think the real beauty of this


152
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,496
is that you can make a


153
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:39,566
connection with a person, right?


154
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:41,816
You can get on the right train


155
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:44,076
like I did, but you also make a


156
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,996
human connection in the process.


157
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:50,006
So the developer's intent here


158
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,666
is to enable communication


159
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,506
between two people in real time.


160
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,586
Just touch the screen and talk.


161
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:57,456
So the first element of


162
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,796
intentional design is what I'm


163
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:00,986
going to call radical


164
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,016
simplification.


165
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,646
So how did they do this?


166
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:07,366
Well, I think they considered


167
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,286
the context really well, the


168
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,226
context that this will be used


169
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:11,546
in.


170
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,086
They took into account where and


171
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:15,696
when people would pull out their


172
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:18,326
phone and launch their app.


173
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:19,826
You're probably in a foreign


174
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:23,976
country, like this guy you're


175
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:27,936
jetlagged, lost, tired, your


176
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:31,256
hair is uncombed, your jacket is


177
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:31,856
rumpled.


178
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,106
I'm not even sure if that's a


179
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:37,156
map that he's carrying at this


180
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:38,466
moment, it kind of looks like a


181
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:38,876
book.


182
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,766
So they remove the UI and allow


183
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:42,996
people to focus on what they


184
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:44,416
need, which is to find


185
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,336
something, to ask a question, to


186
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,056
get their bearings.


187
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:52,936
And it's amazing how much an


188
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,866
experience can change when


189
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:56,756
actions are removed from the UI.


190
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,986
So I want to show you another


191
00:06:58,986 --> 00:06:59,656
example.


192
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,056
This is an app called Vanido.


193
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:03,876
It helps you learn how to sing.


194

It's so simple.


201
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,576
The app tracks the pitch of my


202

voice while I'm singing and it's


203
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,596

219
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:14,076
So what I love about Vanido is


220
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:16,376
that it has stripped away what


221
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:18,606
music education looks like,


222
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:18,846
right?


223
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,326
There's no charts or notes.


224
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,666
It's colorful, it's animated,


225
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,496
and it's fun.


226
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:25,766
And you should have heard me


227
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,866
sing before I started using this


228
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:28,086
app.


229
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,356
It really works.


230
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:31,806
And there's only one interactive


231
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:33,046
element on the screen when


232
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,256
you're singing and it's way up


233
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:35,826
at the top left.


234
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,506
So you can hold your phone like


235
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,336
a microphone and really belt it


236
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,666
out without worrying about


237
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,096
accidentally exiting your

00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:44,576

239
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:47,756
So this is radical


240
00:08:47,756 --> 00:08:49,656
simplification and that's what I


241
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,516
mean, that's the first


242
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,736
manifestation of intent and


243
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,116
intentional design.


244
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:57,396
Being radical means taking


245
00:08:57,396 --> 00:08:58,906
risks, right?


246
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,266
Removing a bunch of stuff from


247
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,116
the UI could be jarring if you


248
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:02,906
don't do it right.


249
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,286
But I think there's a way to


250
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:05,276
reduce your risk.


251
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,356
So next I want to talk about


252
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,786
people and about orienting your


253
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:12,306
design around what people really


254
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:12,716
want.


255
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,426
So what do they want?


256
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,466
I think this is worth exploring


257
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:17,756
because it's almost never


258
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:18,426
obvious.


259
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,536
The first needs that you see


260
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,156
when you start kind of looking


261
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:27,206
at people and the users that you


262
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:28,806
might want to serve are


263
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,476
superficial and you need to dig


264
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:31,436
past those.


265
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:33,206
They might be the first ones


266
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,616
that you think about addressing


267
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,776
or they might be the ones that


268
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,406
pulled you into the problem in


269
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,876
the first place, but you need to


270
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:42,516
keep digging because those


271
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,096
superficial needs often mask


272
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:46,946
deeper needs, right, you could


273
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:48,646
solve them but not really solve


274
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,396
the persons' problem.


275
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,556
So you have to keep digging.


276
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:54,516
The second element of


277
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:55,786
intentional design that I want


278
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:57,546
to get into here is called deep


279
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:58,506
understanding.


280
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,046
So knowing the person that you


281
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,706
want to reach and the actually


282
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:02,796
problem that they have.


283
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:05,726
The deeper you dig the more


284
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,386
likely you are to see where the


285
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:09,616
real opportunity to meet their


286
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:10,406
needs is.


287
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:12,196
And the app that really shows


288
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,066
this off, in my opinion, is


289
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,296
called Streaks Workout.


290
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,916
So it's a workout app but I want


291
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,076
to go behind the scenes a little


292
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:19,306
bit.


293
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:22,176

294
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:23,266
many workout apps.


295

It guides your workouts.

297
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,426
it looks pretty simple.


298
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:29,536
You pick a workout duration and


299
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:29,976
you go.

00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:34,716
But personally, I'll confess


301
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:36,466
that I don't love working out


302
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:40,826
and I've tried many workout apps


303
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:43,566
that I just don't stick with and


304
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:46,506
I want to thank any developers


305
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:47,776
that are here who have developed


306
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:49,456
workout apps that I've tried


307
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,356
because I respect your effort


308
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:55,376
and I'm really trying to get fit


309
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,476
so thank you for that.


310
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,106

311
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,046
staying motivated.


312
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,066

problem, right?


315
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:07,206

316
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,436
inertia when facing something

318
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:14,136
So inertia, just to be clear, is


319
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,146
a disinclination to move.


320
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:18,156
And that's what I feel.


321
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:21,186

322
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,316

how Streaks Workout helps users

handle this.


326
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:31,286
So when you first launch the app


327
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,336
you select movements that you


328
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:34,666

329
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,006

00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:38,876
things.


332
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,216

It auto selects from your


341
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,946
movements and it picks a

00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,516
So let's fast forward a bit.


347
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:07,946
Now I'm doing ten seconds of

00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:21,766
It's a surprise.

those either.


360
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,346
Specifically, what I think works


361
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:32,236
well is that the app confronts


362
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:33,766
the inertia that people might


363
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,416
feel by introducing a sense of


364
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,876
randomness and removing work.


365
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,886
So the developers recognize that


366
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,906
each step in the process of


367
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:44,826
doing a workout requires a


368
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:47,126
choice, requires someone to


369
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:49,336
think about what they want and


370
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,646
these decisions are not things


371
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,906
that everyone wants to make.


372
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,316
So you only choose movements


373
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:55,906
once.


374
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:57,636
After that the app does it for


375
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:57,856
you.


376
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:00,326
And you never choose the

00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:20,836
Really bad.


387
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:24,106
They've taken half of the work


388
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:24,746
out anyway.


389
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,336
So this launch sequence reveals


390
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:30,326
the movements that you'll do and


391
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,256
it helps each workout feel new.


392
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:35,196
Of course there are probably


393
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:36,566
many of you in the audience that


394
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,366
perceive that this app actually


395
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,146
lacks essential features.


396
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,336
Choosing reps is amazing.


397
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,496
Picking a sequence isn't work.


398
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:47,526
If this is you I have great


399
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:47,956
news.


400
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:49,116
There are lots of apps that


401
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,646
allow you to do those things.


402
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:52,236
But I'm curious about what


403
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:53,416
inspired this.


404
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,886
Whenever I see something unique


405
00:13:55,886 --> 00:13:57,816
like this I wonder what's behind


406
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:00,536
it because it's unique and it's


407
00:14:00,536 --> 00:14:01,716
implemented really well.


408
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:03,786
So I asked the developers of


409
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:04,686
Streaks Workout.


410
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:09,436
And it's such a common story to


411
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:12,496
hear about how an app originated


412
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:14,066
with an idea that came out of


413
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:14,686
prison.


414
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,406
So specifically, their idea


415
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:21,196
originated with how inmates in


416
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:22,946
prison keep workouts new and


417
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:23,596
interesting.


418
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,526
So I want to walk you through


419
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,436
how that works.


420
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:30,616
So in prison you take a normal


421
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:31,786
deck of cards and at the


422
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,656
beginning of each workout you


423
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,136
would assign a movement to each


424
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:35,626
suit.


425
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:38,106
So today diamonds are crunches.


426
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,346
The numbers on the cards


427
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:42,356
represent the number of reps per


428
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:42,856
movement.


429
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:44,416
So at the beginning of the


430
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,456
workout you'd put the deck face


431
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:49,106
down and you'd start drawing and


432
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:50,206
each card would deliver a


433
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,566
movement and a rep count.


434
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,606
OK, everyone eight crunches.


435
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,096
So the original app concept was


436
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,056
a literal recreation of this.


437
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:02,086
This is an early comp and they


438
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:04,106
also prototyped shuffling and


439
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:08,276
flipping cards to try to kind of


440
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:11,706
replicate the origin of this


441
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:12,556
prison workout.


442
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:14,466
But they quickly moved past the


443
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:15,566
literal approach.


444
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:17,876
They didn't stick to the literal


445
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,416
deck of cards because it carried


446
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,666
too many constraints.


447
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:22,606
Four suits would limit the


448
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:23,686
number of movements that you


449
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,026
could do in each workout and


450
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:26,266
people would somehow need to


451
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,086
remember that diamonds


452
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:29,546
represented crunches in that


453
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:31,386
particular workout and that's


454
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:32,136
work, right?


455
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:35,056
So instead they focused on the


456
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:36,626
value that they wanted to bring.


457
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:39,586
They wanted to help people make


458
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,066
a habit of working out.


459
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,616
So they acknowledged that people


460
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:46,516
felt inertia when they were


461
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:47,846
going to launch a workout app


462
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,846
and they removed as much as


463
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,466
possible that might trigger that


464
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:53,446
and they stayed true to the


465
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,366
original intent of the prison


466
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,226
workout, which is that spirit of


467
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:58,816
randomness and surprise.


468
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:01,656
And that's what I mean by deep


469
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:02,376
understanding.


470
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:03,806
Knowing the person that you want


471
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,476
to reach and the actual problem


472
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:06,436
that they might have.


473
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:08,476
So the superficial approach to


474
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,076
this workout would have been


475
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,286
just a typical workout app,


476
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:11,646
right?


477
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,036
Of course people want to get


478
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:13,516
healthy.


479
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:15,756
But what people really want, or


480
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:17,326
what I really want anyway is to


481
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,286
get past the boredom and that


482
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:20,626
inertia and they've addressed


483
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:21,306
that for me.


484
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:27,306
So knowing users is nothing new.


485
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:30,386
I'm guessing a lot of you here


486
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,726
have personas and market


487
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,106
segments and you do surveys and


488
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,796
other kinds of user research


489
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,336
focus groups.


490
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:40,326
Maybe you create experience maps


491
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:41,846
and customer journeys and user


492
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:42,536
stories.


493
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,086
All of those can be useful


494
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:45,616
models.


495
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:48,266
But they have to feel authentic,


496
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:48,776
right?


497
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,716
They actually have to feel like


498
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:51,366
people.


499
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,776
That can make focus easier and


500
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,316
it can help teams kind of come


501
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,966
together around a vision.


502
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,676
As long as you share a common


503
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,856
understanding and you feel a


504
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,356
real empathy for the person that


505
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,576
you're designing for.


506
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:06,705
Those can work.


507
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,935
But too often those artifacts of


508
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:12,836
needs and goals and skills, they


509
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:14,165
just feel artificial.


510
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:16,685
They may not connect with


511
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:17,286
everyone.


512
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,816
They feel complicated or distant


513
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:20,576
or corny.


514
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:24,036
So for a moment I want to talk


515
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:26,586
about how much easier it is to


516
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,376
make some something when you


517
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,226
really care about the person


518
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:31,266
you're making it for.


519
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:34,286
So I first heard about this


520
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,316
story that I'm going to tell you


521
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:35,836
in a book.


522
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,146
It's by a guy named Alan Cooper,


523
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:40,296
he's a software developer from


524
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:42,816
the early days, and his claim to


525
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,686
fame is that he created a


526
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:47,276
prototype that became Visual


527
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:47,786
Basic.


528
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:50,776
And this is an actual pixel


529
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:53,646
resolution of Visual Basic 1.0


530
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:55,816
on a 4K display.


531
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:57,676
It's pretty amazing.


532
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,696
So Alan built this with a small


533
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,986
team and as he did it he began


534
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:05,876
to recognize a problem in


535
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,716
maintaining a focus on what


536
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:08,716
people really want.


537
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,596
And he tells this great story in


538
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,866
a book about another invention


539
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,286
and that story is a parable of


540
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:20,026
how powerful knowing people can


541
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:21,666
be, knowing the person that


542
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,696
you're designing for.


543
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:25,506
So apologies if I got your hopes


544
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:26,596
up about Visual Basic.


545
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:27,676
I'm actually not going to talk


546
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:28,246
about that.


547
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,986
I want to focus on this story


548
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,366
and kind of extend it a little


549
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:32,686
bit.


550
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:35,226
So the invention that he talks


551
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:37,496
about is the Rollaboard


552
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:38,346
Suitcase.


553
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:40,596
So this is the patent form for


554
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:41,356
the Rollaboard.


555
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,746
So nowadays the suitcase might


556
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,186
seem pretty unremarkable.


557
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:49,106
For most of us this is just a


558
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:51,016
suitcase, big deal.


559
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,386
But it actually hasn't been


560
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:54,296
around for that long.


561
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:56,676
The patent was filed in 1989.


562
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:58,086
People have been traveling


563
00:18:58,276 --> 00:18:59,086
forever though.


564
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:01,706
So why did it take so long to


565
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:03,806
design something so obvious?


566
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,556
The inventor was a guy named


567
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:07,276
Robert Plath.


568
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,496
I'm guessing not a household


569
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,486
name, but more on that in a


570
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:11,746
minute.


571
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:15,126
So what was innovative about


572
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:15,536
this?


573
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,556
Well, I think the innovations


574
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,176
are subtle.


575
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:19,666
It wasn't the wheels.


576
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:22,476
Many patents had been filed for


577
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:24,146
wheeled suitcases before.


578
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,396
This is from the '70s.


579
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:28,416
So the wheels are underneath and


580
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,966
it's also got some kind of leash


581
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:30,406
thing.


582
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:35,166
Suitcase manufactures had been


583
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,826
trying to put wheels on


584
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:38,586
suitcases as far back as the


585
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,006
'40s and this actually has some


586
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:43,476
kind of other leash thing, some


587
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,706
grabber thing that you can see


588
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:46,356
right there.


589
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:49,716
So clearly people have been


590
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:51,306
trying to figure out a way to


591
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,466
not carry heavy things.


592
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:56,176
So if you worked in the luggage


593
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:59,176
industry in 1989, you probably


594
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,976
thought you'd already innovated.


595
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:02,876
You weren't worried about this


596
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,186
new patent I'm guessing.


597
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,446
But we all know what happened,


598
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:06,736
right?


599
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:08,456
The new design became the de


600
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,416
facto design of suitcases.


601
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,526
And the improvements in


602
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:13,846
retrospect are totally obvious.


603
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,656
There's a handle at the top so


604
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:17,336
the whole suitcase it oriented


605
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:18,126
to be upright.


606
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,326
It's easy to grab and pull and


607
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:20,686
pivot.


608
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,036
That is the evolution of the


609
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:23,566
leash.


610
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:27,046
Second the wheels, right?


611
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,546
The wheels are placed on the


612
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,946
edge so they're only fully


613
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,596
engaged when the suitcase is


614
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:32,086
tilted.


615
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,686
And finally the size, it's small


616
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:38,006
enough to lift and place in an


617
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:40,426
overhead bin.


618
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,216
So nothing particularly


619
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:44,196
revolutionary but the inventor


620
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:47,166
Robert Plath made each decision


621
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,986
to serve a really specific


622
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:51,716
person, a person who traveled


623
00:20:51,716 --> 00:20:52,386
for a living.


624
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,626
Robert Plath was a pilot for


625
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:55,716
Northwest Airlines.


626
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:57,956
He intimately knew the pain of


627
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,306
lugging and lifting heavy


628
00:20:59,306 --> 00:20:59,796
things.


629
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:00,916
He did it every day.


630
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:03,516
And he deeply understood what


631
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:06,026
people like him wanted, to move


632
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:07,356
with ease while looking


633
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:08,796
professional, and he made


634
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:10,826
something perfectly suited for


635
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:11,116
that.


636
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,446
So what I find really


637
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:14,356
interesting is that at the


638
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,456
times, 1989, there were only


639
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:18,986
about 100,000 travel


640
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,066
professionals as the Census Data


641
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,556
called them, but pilots, flight


642
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:23,856
attendants, people in the travel


643
00:21:23,856 --> 00:21:24,426
industry.


644
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,776
That 100,000 might seem like a


645
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:28,666
lot, but when you compare that


646
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,986
number to the overall market of


647
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:32,676
people who traveled a couple


648
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:35,326
times a year, just like more


649
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,696
than 100 million at the time,


650
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,736
and that's just Census Data from


651
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:42,996
the U.S., his target user,


652
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:45,376
quote-unquote, was a really


653
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:47,146
specific person that represented


654
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:50,176
only 0.1% of 1% of the market.


655
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,506
So what I'm saying is that


656
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,456
typical methods of market


657
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,046
identification probably would


658
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:59,756
not have led Robert Plath to


659
00:21:59,756 --> 00:22:00,936
focus so narrowly.


660
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:04,156
He focused on an extreme use


661
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,516
case, a person who traveled all


662
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:08,596
the time.


663
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,096
So I'm using extreme


664
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:13,176
intentionally to emphasize that


665
00:22:13,176 --> 00:22:14,686
he focused on what we might call


666
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:15,656
an edge case.


667
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,256
The market size was really small


668
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,296
and his solution was kind of


669
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:21,896
whacky.


670
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,706
It looked really different.


671
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:26,536
It implied a new kind of default


672
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:28,806
way of interacting with your


673
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:29,376
luggage.


674
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:33,956
So he focused on the needs of


675
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:35,936
people he intimately knew and


676
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:38,146
that extreme focus allowed the


677
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:40,246
real needs of a lot of people to


678
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:41,326
come to the surface.


679
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,036
So his focus gave him the


680
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,926
freedom to arrive at an extreme


681
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:46,556
solution.


682
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:49,336
So the third element of intent


683
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:51,306
is extreme focus.


684
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,936
So what might seem like an edge


685
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:56,676
case could be what frees you to


686
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,176
reorient or refocus your design.


687
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,886
Make it more coherent.


688
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:01,786
Make it simpler.


689
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,616
And therefore actually reach


690
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,506
more people.


691
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,796
So let's relate extreme to our


692
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:10,406
work.


693
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,226
Is there a way to relate extreme


694
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,266
to the work that we do?


695
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:15,646
I think there is and I think


696
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,196
being extreme can be really


697
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,576
worthwhile but you have to nail


698
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:19,706
it.


699
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:22,846
So you might not immediately


700
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:25,696
associate the words extreme and


701
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:26,856
weather app.


702
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,766
But Carrot Weather is a really


703
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,686
compelling illustration of being


704
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:33,456
extreme.


705
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:36,396
So on the surface it's a weather


706
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:36,646
app.


707
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:37,926
So let's check the weather


708
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:38,646
forecast.


709
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:42,116
>> I wonder how many licks it


710
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,626
takes to get to the center of a


711
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:44,446
human skull.


712
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:48,476
>> So right, they're not typical


713
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:49,326
forecasts.


714
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:51,086
The voice of Carrot, which is


715
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:52,476
the robotic voice that you


716
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:54,676
heard, has personality and


717
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:57,136
attitude and a little bit of an


718
00:23:58,116 --> 00:23:58,196
edge.


719
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:00,606
You probably think this sunshine


720
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,416
means that things are starting


721
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,326
to look up for you.


722
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:04,456
They're not.


723
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:08,256
So you might ask is that even a


724
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:08,926
forecast [laughing]?


725
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:14,456
So sometimes when I read these


726
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:15,996
things I just feel like it's


727
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,046
being mean to me.


728
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:20,066
It's definitely got an attitude


729
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:22,096
but the key information is super


730
00:24:22,096 --> 00:24:23,596
readable and the screen is


731
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,036
really nicely organized.


732
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:28,216
The color scheme changes


733
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,826
according to the time of day and


734
00:24:29,826 --> 00:24:30,906
it's really playful.


735
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:32,616
And it's got those illustrations


736
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:33,766
along the bottom that are


737
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,726
sometimes bizarre and often


738
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,366
really funny.


739
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:41,386
So the forecast is only one of


740
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,286
quite a few unique elements in


741
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:43,706
the app.


742
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:46,066
So I ask the developer whose


743
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,796
name is Brian Mueller, to help


744
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,756
me understand where this came


745
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:52,316
from and he told me something


746
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:52,966
interesting.


747
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:54,916
He said that when we writes in


748
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,186
the voice of Carrot, he's


749
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:59,866
channeling the personalities of


750
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,456
people really close to him --


751
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,696
his wife, his sister, and his


752
00:25:03,696 --> 00:25:04,136
mom.


753
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:08,126
And these forecasts are a form


754
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:11,706
of conversation with them.


755
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,306
So the lesson is that the people


756
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:15,756
that Brian is trying to reach,


757
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:17,976
the people that he's speaking to


758
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,486
with these forecasts are


759
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,756
actually really specific.


760
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:23,196
And I think that's what makes


761
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:24,366
his apps stand out.


762
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:26,246
The edginess helps him connect


763
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:26,856
with people.


764
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,566
And it's not surprising to me


765
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:30,246
that he's had so much success in


766
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:30,976
the app store.


767
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:33,486
The personal touch is what


768
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:35,666
allows his app to deeply connect


769
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:38,926
with the rest of us.


770
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:42,706
Obviously personality isn't the


771
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:45,056
sole province of weather apps.


772
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:47,596
All apps can deliver something


773
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:48,096
like this.


774
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,326
All apps can feel handcrafted


775
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:51,096
and special.


776
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:53,096
And that's the fourth element of


777
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,256
intent that I want to talk


778
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:54,476
about.


779
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:56,776
Intentionally designed apps feel


780
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:57,636
personal.


781
00:25:58,096 --> 00:25:59,316
They create a personal


782
00:25:59,316 --> 00:25:59,866
connection.


783
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:03,386
So the point isn't to spice up


784
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:04,806
your copy, right?


785
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:07,516
The point is that spicy copy in


786
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:08,966
the right context feels


787
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:09,666
memorable.


788
00:26:12,356 --> 00:26:14,826
And it must be said that the


789
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:16,196
personality of Carrot is


790
00:26:16,196 --> 00:26:17,666
probably not for everyone.


791
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:20,496
And I talked with Brian he


792
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,636
commented on this.


793
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,336
So you can probably imagine the


794
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:26,316
email and Tweets that he gets


795
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:29,786
from people who are surprised or


796
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:31,846
upset or offended by the


797
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:33,366
forecast after they download the


798
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:33,636
app.


799
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:37,026
Like, you know, how dare he


800
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:39,526
insult meteorologists like this?


801
00:26:40,986 --> 00:26:42,976
So he offers an olive branch --


802
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:45,546
[ Laughter ]


803
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:48,166
To these disgruntled souls.


804
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:50,636
They can adjust the personality


805
00:26:50,636 --> 00:26:52,096
from the default, which as you


806
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,496
saw was Homicidal.


807
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:56,196
You could go the left for less


808
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:58,116
edge and to the right for more.


809
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:02,896
But the bottom line just to be


810
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:05,646
clear is that edgy text would be


811
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:08,056
less funny or perhaps not funny


812
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:10,106
at all if the app didn't work,


813
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:10,766
right?


814
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:12,546
It's a good weather app with


815
00:27:12,546 --> 00:27:14,436
simple navigation and a playful


816
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:14,726
UI.


817
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,866
The extreme personality though


818
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:20,436
is what gives life and sprit to


819
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:20,556
it.


820
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,506
So when I get a Carrot


821
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,246
notification it's similar to the


822
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:26,506
feeling that I have when I go


823
00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:28,816
out to a local restaurant or bar


824
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:31,266
where everyone knows my name,


825
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:31,706
right?


826
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,996
It's enjoyable, it's personal,


827
00:27:34,106 --> 00:27:35,036
and it's comfortable.


828
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,296
So we've got four things that


829
00:27:39,296 --> 00:27:41,076
characterize intent and the


830
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,576
behavior of intentionally


831
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:43,416
designed apps.


832
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,466
And I want to flip things around


833
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,596
for a moment and talk about what


834
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:48,676
happens when you're not


835
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:49,446
intentional.


836
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:52,046
In other words, where does bad


837
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,046
UI come from?


838
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:55,926
So I think the best friends and


839
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,946
the worst enemies to designing


840
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:00,126
intentionally are all of the


841
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:02,336
systems and patterns that we've


842
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:04,096
internalized as we've gained


843
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,346
experience in the work that we


844
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:05,656
do.


845
00:28:06,696 --> 00:28:08,426
This experience allows us to


846
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:10,026
make decisions quickly and to be


847
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:11,786
really efficient in that work.


848
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:15,876
But these familiar patterns get


849
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,756
in the way of our ability to


850
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:19,566
reckon with new problems.


851
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:20,726
Sometimes we won't even


852
00:28:20,726 --> 00:28:22,226
recognize that the problems are


853
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,626
new and this is true of anyone


854
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,636
who has tried to make anything


855
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:28,886
new ever, right?


856
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:31,146
Suitcases once had a form.


857
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,266
They were rectangular and the


858
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:34,726
long side was down.


859
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:37,966
That form was adjusted but the


860
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,546
fundamental elements were always


861
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:40,536
taken as a given.


862
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:43,426
The wheels were tacked on but


863
00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:45,476
the overall form stayed the


864
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:45,966
same.


865
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:49,826
For decades smart people


866
00:28:50,246 --> 00:28:52,306
considered this form and stopped


867
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:52,696
there.


868
00:28:53,186 --> 00:28:55,246
It took someone with a very


869
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:57,646
sharp focus on an extreme


870
00:28:57,646 --> 00:29:00,006
audience to break out of this


871
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:03,446
pattern, right, and turn the


872
00:29:03,446 --> 00:29:04,726
form on it's head [laughing].


873
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:06,976
Thank you.


874
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:09,546
[ Applause ]


875
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:12,136
So we apply patterns


876
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:12,906
automatically.


877
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,486
Our brains make connections


878
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,306
quickly and that has benefits,


879
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:17,506
right?


880
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,996
It helps us work efficiently.


881
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:21,956
It helps us be consistent, but


882
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:23,206
it also prevents us from


883
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:25,506
noticing the obvious and


884
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,766
challenging it, asking


885
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,106
fundamental questions, why does


886
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:31,026
this thing need to be this way?


887
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,786
So as a UI designer it's really


888
00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:36,356
tempting always to draw on


889
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:38,336
familiar UI elements to solve


890
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:39,216
new problems.


891
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:41,786
I'm sure you're familiar with


892
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:42,906
the house icon.


893
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:44,926
It made sense in a desktop


894
00:29:44,926 --> 00:29:45,476
browser.


895
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:48,766
A browser is a frame for the


896
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,026
Internet universe.


897
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,956
A browser home button will lift


898
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:55,456
you out of whatever corner of


899
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:57,776
the dark web that you found


900
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,036
yourself in and allows you to


901
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:00,976
get out of there.


902
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:02,896
So that notion of home was


903
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:04,336
extended to iPhone and the


904
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,756
behavior is similar.


905
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:08,776
It's a shortcut, it's an easy


906
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,406
button, home is a starting


907
00:30:10,406 --> 00:30:13,556
place, and unlike in real life,


908
00:30:13,556 --> 00:30:14,926
home is a place that you can


909
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:17,056
always return to with a simple


910
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:17,636
gesture.


911
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:20,646
You can go home whenever you


912
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:21,016
want.


913
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:24,326
So home is also a familiar


914
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:25,416
notion in the finder.


915
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,206
Here the spirit is more like --


916
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,556
you followed the river to it's


917
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:31,396
headwaters.


918
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:33,756
On the Mac, home represents a


919
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:34,526
container.


920
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,046
Everything is in here.


921
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:37,686
You don't need to look anywhere


922
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:37,986
else.


923
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:40,866
you have reached the source.


924
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:45,406
Home in these contexts offers


925
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:48,236
reliability, safety, an ability


926
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:50,066
to return as you navigate


927
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:50,616
outward.


928
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:54,256
And it's clear obvious utility


929
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,926
elsewhere on the platform might


930
00:30:56,926 --> 00:30:58,716
seem like a reasonable choice as


931
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:00,466
a tab bar icon, right?


932
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:04,866
Except there's a crucial


933
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:06,456
difference in using the notion


934
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:07,726
of home in a tab bar.


935
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:12,226
To be blunt, an app isn't a


936
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:14,656
frame containing god knows what.


937
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:18,216
A typical app offers specific


938
00:31:18,216 --> 00:31:20,026
things, specific contents,


939
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:21,746
specific tools, specific


940
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,426
actions.


941
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,826
And a tab bar is a quick


942
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:26,726
expression of the overall


943
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:28,246
utility of your app.


944
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:30,066
It's a high-level map of your


945
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:31,433
app.


946
00:31:31,696 --> 00:31:33,676
So let's use an example that's


947
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:36,016
close to home -- the tab bar of


948
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:37,866
WWDC app.


949
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:41,486
So we all can get a quick


950
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:43,946
understanding of the scope of


951
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,596
information that's available in


952
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:47,226
the app simply by scanning the


953
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:47,786
tab bar.


954
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:50,196
We can guess at what content


955
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:52,716
might be in each tab.


956
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,756
So tab bar icons and tab bar


957
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:56,556
labels should be as direct as


958
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:57,246
possible.


959
00:31:57,976 --> 00:32:00,086
And this directness will then


960
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,896
limit what each tab can contain


961
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:03,766
and that's great.


962
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,296
Directness creates


963
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,246
predictability.


964
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:09,166
So the app may not do


965
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:12,836
everything, right, no app does


966
00:32:12,836 --> 00:32:13,346
everything.


967
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:15,166
But people won't have to hunt


968
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,466
around to figure out what it


969
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:17,656
does and doesn't do.


970
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,726
So when I talk about home I'm


971
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:21,816
talking about a metaphor,


972
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:24,816
homeland, a home base.


973
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:29,186
So let's just dig in to why home


974
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:29,946
doesn't work.


975
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:32,506
First it's overly broad and it


976
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:33,516
feels generic.


977
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,126
And I think it's a copout.


978
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:37,996
You're avoiding a decision by


979
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:39,246
naming a tab Home.


980
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,876
The perceived comforts of home


981
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,236
as an icon in a label are


982
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:45,406
getting in the way of being


983
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,596
direct, of clearly and directly


984
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:48,976
communicating the scope of


985
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,616
what's in your app.


986
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,236
If your app is a meditation app


987
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,796
and offers content related to


988
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,046
meditating and building a


989
00:32:57,046 --> 00:33:01,036
meditation practice, imagine the


990
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:02,666
impression that it would leave


991
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,686
on people if not only the tab


992
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,456
bar was more direct, but the


993
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:07,976
directness of the tab bar


994
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,256
enforced a simplicity and an


995
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:12,296
order on the content that you


996
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:12,926
display.


997
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:15,576
And that content was predictable


998
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,356
and directly organized.


999
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,236
So indirect labels feel


1000
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,246
conventional and they feel safe


1001
00:33:22,356 --> 00:33:23,726
but they mask utility.


1002
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:25,786
Like a storage locker you're


1003
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,066
putting your valuable stuff


1004
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:29,066
behind a door that's anonymous


1005
00:33:29,096 --> 00:33:29,946
and inscrutable.


1006
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:32,176
And this is what I mean by


1007
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,396
unintentional design.


1008
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,436
No one intends to be indirect.


1009
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,516
Being intentional will lead to


1010
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:41,886
cleaner and clearer


1011
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:42,706
communication.


1012
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:44,846
And this brings me to my final


1013
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:45,936
element of intent.


1014
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:47,976
Direct communication.


1015
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:49,806
Intentionally design things.


1016
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,366
Clearly communicate to the


1017
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:52,466
people who use them.


1018
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:55,766
And the way to achieve this is


1019
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:57,486
to draw on what people learn on


1020
00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:59,606
the platform and in the world.


1021
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:01,456
So I want to show you a couple


1022
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:04,266
of last quick examples of apps


1023
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:06,616
that rely on a familiar form to


1024
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,356
make interactions feel useful.


1025
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:12,065
So the core concept of an app


1026
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:13,666
called Tinycards is to bring


1027
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,045
flashcards on to a mobile


1028
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:15,636
advice.


1029
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:17,416
You can use them to memorize


1030
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,315
pretty much anything --


1031
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,916
languages, flowers, leaves,


1032
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:22,306
almost anything.


1033
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:25,255
So the interaction within the


1034
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,516
app is super direct.


1035
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:28,226
People expect cards to have


1036
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:29,916
dimension, so that periodic


1037
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,686
pulse is inviting you to


1038
00:34:31,686 --> 00:34:32,866
interact with the card.


1039
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:35,156
You flip the card over by


1040
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:35,735
tapping it.


1041
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:37,716
So these cards have two sides.


1042
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:40,286
They've respected the metaphor


1043
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,005
of the card.


1044
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:43,416
People appreciate that.


1045
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,525
So the entire experience of


1046
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,516
Tinycards is based on quickly


1047
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:51,076
flicking through these cards as


1048
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:52,386
you commit things to memory.


1049
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:54,775
Like for instance the flags of


1050
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:55,906
Canadian provinces.


1051
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:56,926
Does anyone know this one?


1052
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:01,886
Ontario. Let's try it.


1053
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:05,236
Oh my gosh.


1054
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:07,796
You've done that quiz before,


1055
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:08,566
right?


1056
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:12,086
So the UI of Tinycards is so


1057
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,876
clear you don't even think about


1058
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:14,016
it.


1059
00:35:14,186 --> 00:35:15,666
Working with cards feels


1060
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,056
completely natural and you can


1061
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:18,386
just focus on your goal, which


1062
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,266
is learning stuff.


1063
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:22,466
So what Tinycards demonstrates


1064
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:24,336
to me is that if you implement a


1065
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:26,056
metaphor well, people will


1066
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:27,266
instantly become immersed.


1067
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:28,386
They'll forget that they're even


1068
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:29,566
interacting with a UI.


1069
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,026
And once they're immersed, you


1070
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,876
even have the opportunity to


1071
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:36,926
extend the metaphor, to really


1072
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,776
surprise and even delight


1073
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,246
people.


1074
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:41,686
So I want to show you a game.


1075
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,856
It's called Gorogoa and it


1076
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:45,796
extends the metaphor of the card


1077
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,536
in a way that I feel like


1078
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:49,216
creates a truly unique


1079
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,076
experience.


1080
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,806
So Gorogoa is a puzzle game.


1081
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,616
You move cards around a grid and


1082
00:35:55,616 --> 00:35:57,516
you advance in the game and in


1083
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:58,986
the story by getting them into


1084
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,086
the right positions.


1085
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:01,866
But you could see that these


1086
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,976
cards do things that no actual


1087
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:05,026
cards can do.


1088
00:36:05,386 --> 00:36:07,886
They can be torn off and as


1089
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:09,026
you'll see in a moment they can


1090
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:10,366
actually stitch themselves


1091
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:12,756
together into a scene.


1092
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:19,246
Yeah, this is an incredible


1093
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:19,616
game.


1094
00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:22,236
[ Applause ]


1095
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:24,176
And it's a great example of how


1096
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:25,596
you can extend the metaphor


1097
00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:27,386
farther than you might think and


1098
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,206
create something truly amazing.


1099
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,566
This moment right here where


1100
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:32,976
you've got this card metaphor


1101
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:34,396
that suddenly kind of


1102
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:35,966
disappears, that's purely


1103
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:37,906
delightful and it's really I


1104
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:39,966
think a great testament to how


1105
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:42,266
well he's implemented the


1106
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,286
metaphor of cards.


1107
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:47,476
Bending and extending metaphors


1108
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:49,626
doesn't work if the result


1109
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,666
doesn't extend the utility, or


1110
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,556
value, or delight of your app.


1111
00:36:53,616 --> 00:36:55,806
That's why the home tab on the


1112
00:36:56,106 --> 00:36:57,556
tab bar doesn't work, right?


1113
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:59,506
It doesn't extend the utility of


1114
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:01,676
the app or create any additional


1115
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:02,206
value.


1116
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:05,046
So the last app I want to show


1117
00:37:05,046 --> 00:37:08,226
you is an example that combines


1118
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,906
metaphors from the real and


1119
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:11,466
digital world in a really simple


1120
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:11,966
way.


1121
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,426
It's called Rosarium.


1122
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:14,056
Yeah.


1123
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:19,546
[ Applause ]


1124
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:22,486
I think the developers are here.


1125
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:23,746
It's a rosary that you wear on


1126
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:25,526
your wrist and I believe that is


1127
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:29,526
Latin and the font is really


1128
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:30,816
communicating to me that it's


1129
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,046
Latin anyway.


1130
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:34,236
So the beads are represented by


1131
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:34,876
circles.


1132
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:36,416
Each time you turn the digital


1133
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,516
crown you get a slight haptic


1134
00:37:38,576 --> 00:37:38,836
tab.


1135
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:40,676
So when I met the developers


1136
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,156
they told me that they were


1137
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:44,086
inspired by the similarity


1138
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:46,276
between the feel of rotating the


1139
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:48,276
digital crown and the feel of an


1140
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,566
actual rosary bead.


1141
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,736
So the app has translated this


1142
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:54,866
real world object, just a strand


1143
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:56,616
of beads, into the virtual world


1144
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:58,866
in a way that feels really


1145
00:37:58,866 --> 00:37:59,476
natural.


1146
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:01,966
So I'm no suggesting that it's a


1147
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:04,116
replacement for rosary beads or


1148
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,546
any prayer beads because the


1149
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:07,496
physical beads can have deep,


1150
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:09,056
you know, personal meaning.


1151
00:38:09,576 --> 00:38:11,066
But I love how they've


1152
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:13,066
thoughtfully carried that real


1153
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,786
world experience into a digital


1154
00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:16,626
form in a way that's so


1155
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:18,476
radically simple and clear.


1156
00:38:19,486 --> 00:38:20,666
And I think it really


1157
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:23,516
illustrates each of the points


1158
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:24,646
that I made earlier -- the


1159
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:26,326
simplicity and the understanding


1160
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:28,946
of people, the extreme kind of


1161
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:31,256
focus on a problem and the


1162
00:38:31,256 --> 00:38:32,906
direct communication of a


1163
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:33,626
solution.


1164
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:36,736
And this is intent in action.


1165
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:38,226
This is being intentional in


1166
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:38,756
design.


1167
00:38:38,756 --> 00:38:41,036
It's a matter of turning off the


1168
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:43,956
automatic part of your brain, of


1169
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:46,176
slowing down, and challenging


1170
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:46,956
the obvious.


1171
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:51,216
It requires a level of intention


1172
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:53,326
that will enable your decisions


1173
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:55,266
to become more conscious and for


1174
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,186
you to become aware of the


1175
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:58,876
patterns and the familiar things


1176
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:00,016
that might get in the way and


1177
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:02,996
block you and focus on people,


1178
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:03,566
right?


1179
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:04,486
The people that you want to


1180
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:06,706
serve, the person who inspires


1181
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:08,446
you, the family member who


1182
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,696
allows you to be the best


1183
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,506
version of yourself, the


1184
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:14,796
coworkers with whom you share a


1185
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:16,686
real need for something better,


1186
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:19,386
and you can take that


1187
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:21,936
inspiration and use it to


1188
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:24,016
discover newer and better ways


1189
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:26,626
to connect with people and to


1190
00:39:26,846 --> 00:39:28,746
create something really great.


1191
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,096
So you can check out more about


1192
00:39:33,096 --> 00:39:34,056
my session here.


1193
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,116
Thank you very much.


1194
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:40,036
And please, please stick around


1195
00:39:40,036 --> 00:39:43,796
for the next talk.


1196
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:45,736
The next talk is designing fluid


1197
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:46,726
interfaces.


1198
00:39:47,266 --> 00:39:48,886
It's a great talk.


1199
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,986
Easily one of the top seven


1200
00:39:50,986 --> 00:39:52,486
design talks at this year's


1201
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:53,236
WWDC.


1202
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:54,396
So thank you.
