Abstract: A view controller that manages the primary view within the application. It creates a CLLocationManager and turns on heading updates. As updates are received, it displays them in a graph, x, y, and z labels, and also computes the magnitude (size or strength) of the magnetic vector. The units for all values are microteslas.
