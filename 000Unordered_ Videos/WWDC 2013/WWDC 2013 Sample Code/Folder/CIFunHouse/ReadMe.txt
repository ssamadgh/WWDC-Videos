Core Image Filters with Photos and Video for iOS

The CIFunHouse project shows how to apply Core Image built in and custom CIFilters to photos and video.  The application presents view controllers for adding photo and video sources, choosing CIFilters from a list, and making live adjustments to filter parameters.  The project also contains code for custom CIFilter subclasses for effect such as Sobel edge detection, old-style-film, and fake-depth-of-field looks.  The code also demonstrates how to save a filtered video stream to the ALAssetsLibrary while simultaneously previewing the video on the display.

To run the app on an iPhone or iPod Touch, tap the Filters button in the toolbar, then tap "+" and select an input source. You can then apply additional filters. Swipe in the Filters table view to delete a filter.
