Current Address

ABSTRACT

Demonstrates basic use of MapKit, displaying a map view and setting its region to current location.

It makes use of the MKReverseGeocoder class that provides services for converting your map coordinate (specified as a latitude/longitude pair) into information about that coordinate, such as the country, city, or street. A reverse geocoder object is a single-shot object that works with a network-based map service to look up placemark information for its specified coordinate value.  To use placemark information is leverages the MKPlacemark class to store this information.

Important:
The MapKit framework uses Google services to provide map data. Use of this class and the associated interfaces binds you to the Google Maps/Google Earth API terms of service. You can find these terms of service mentioned in the header section of "MKMapView.h".

===========================================================================
DISCUSSION

The MapViewController class and MapViewController.xib encapsulate all the interactions with the map view. These files are a good place to start to see how to set the region and map type of an MKMapView object.
