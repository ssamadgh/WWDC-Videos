1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:04,003
With the introduction
of the revolutionary iPhone X


2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,139
and Apple TV 4K,


3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,642
the video experience
is taken to a whole new level


4
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:11,645
with the addition of support
for high dynamic range video.


5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,850
With HD, you only see
16 million colors.


6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,320
But with HDR,
you see one billion colors.


7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,122
HDR allows content creators


8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,725
to use a much richer
and vibrant color palette,


9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,028
which results in unbelievable
and stunning image quality.


10
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,467
To better understand
how HDR works,


11
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,534
let's first take a look


12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,304
at the evolution
in color capabilities.


13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,641
Here is a representation
of the visible color spectrum.


14
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,343
With the introduction
of HD in 1990,


15
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,747
the color space was defined in
ITU Rec 709


16
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:51,518
and covered about 36 percent
of the visible spectrum.


17
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,588
But, a lot has changed
since 1990,


18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:58,292
and since then, the P3
color space was introduced.


19
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,395
This color space is widely
supported across our platforms


20
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,298
for all types of app content.


21
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,567
Then in 2012,
Recommendation 2020


22
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,503
was introduced
to define the color space


23
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,039
for Ultra High-Definition
television,


24
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,241
which offers a much wider
color space


25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,812
that covers more than 75 percent
of the visible spectrum.


26
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,648
Video content can now be
delivered to supported devices


27
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,017
in any of these
three color spaces,


28
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,521
enabling far more realistic
and rich color reproduction.


29
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,693
But, the color space itself
isn't the whole story.


30
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,429
The luminance range and settings
of the target display


31
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,631
is also extremely important


32
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:41,435
and impacts how a given color
is going to be perceived.


33
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,137
This combination of color space
and luminance range


34
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,673
is often described
as the color volume,


35
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,377
with the luminance values
on a logarithmic scale.


36
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,212
With standard
dynamic range content,


37
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,613
it is assumed that displays


38
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,183
offer a peak luminance
of 100 nits,


39
00:01:56,183 --> 00:02:00,921
yielding a relatively modest
color volume.


40
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,291
However, HDR formats
are designed to support displays


41
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,728
capable of up to 10,000 nits of
peak luminance,


42
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,529
yielding a much richer
color volume


43
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,431
for content creators
to work with.


44
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,569
To further understand
the impact of luminance,


45
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,672
let's take a look
at a 100 percent red square


46
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,274
in the P3 color space.


47
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,745
If the brightness setting of the
display is at about 50 percent,


48
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:28,115
the red square
might look something like this.


49
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:31,418
However, if the brightness
of the display is turned up,


50
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,454
the very same RGB value
looks quite different


51
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,223
and more intense.


52
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,692
Similarly, if the brightness
is turned down,


53
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,795
it looks much more dull.


54
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,164
As you can see
in this illustration,


55
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,534
simply utilizing the RGB values
without having control


56
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,936
or context of the luminance
of the display


57
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,007
leads to vastly different
color perception by the viewer.


58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,876
This also doesn't
take into account


59
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,079
other influencing factors
such as the ambient light level


60
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,816
or the color temperature
of the ambient light.


61
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,585
Another key goal of HDR
is to help improve


62
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:09,156
consistency in playback
across different displays.


63
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,592
In SDR video, the target display
is assumed to be capable


64
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,263
of up to approximately
100 nits of peak brightness.


65
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:19,533
However, the actual capabilities
of modern displays


66
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,635
far exceeds this value,


67
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,537
and so each display
then attempts


68
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,739
to interpolate the appropriate
brightness levels


69
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,675
to match its own
luminance range.


70
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,610
This leads to
all kinds of variance


71
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,945
in the appearance
of a given video


72
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,815
across different displays,
and in many cases,


73
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,452
a very loose interpretation
of the original artistic intent.


74
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,756
Now that you have
a basic understanding


75
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,125
of the key elements
of color and luminance,


76
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,427
and some of the goals of HDR,


77
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,498
let's dig into the types
of HDR video that we support.


78
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:56,169
We support two HDR standards:
Dolby Vision and HDR10.


79
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,605
These two formats share
some common principles,


80
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,640
but also differ in many ways.


81
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,478
One of the commonalities
between the formats


82
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,947
is how the luminance values
are encoded.


83
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,882
Because the human eye
is more sensitive


84
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,917
in dark ranges
than light ranges,


85
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,386
the luminance values
are encoded on a curve,


86
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,255
so that greater detail in darks


87
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,892
can be encoded using
the limited bits available.


88
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,062
In SDR, the gamma curve
was relatively shallow,


89
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,263
but this was sufficient


90
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,434
for the assumed peak target
display luminance of 100 nits.


91
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,936
For HDR, a new
luminance encoding curve


92
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,204
has been introduced.


93
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,340
Known as
the Perceptual Quantizer,


94
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,042
it can better map these
perceptible luminance changes


95
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,312
across the broader,
10,000 nit range.


96
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,949
This curve,
described in SMPTE ST 2084,


97
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,818
allows for even
smoother gradation


98
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,620
of dark luminance values,


99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,256
yielding a far better experience
for the viewer.


100
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:53,026
This curve is utilized
by both Dolby Vision and HDR10.


101
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,298
In HDR10,
a static set of metadata


102
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,300
is included in the video stream.


103
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,738
This metadata includes
information about the display


104
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,907
on which the content
was originally mastered,


105
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:11,645
such as its effective
color gamut, white point,


106
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,313
and luminance range.


107
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,418
It also includes information
about the content itself,


108
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,588
namely the peak
and average luminance levels.


109
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,658
This metadata can then
be used by the target display


110
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,394
to tone map the content
to the output capabilities


111
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,662
of the display.


112
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,433
With HDR10,
the metadata is applied


113
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,203
to the entire length
of the program.


114
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,805
Dolby Vision gives you
even more control,


115
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,341
allowing for metadata to
be conveyed dynamically


116
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,744
on a scene-by-scene,
or even frame-by-frame basis.


117
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,048
This way, the available
luminance range of the display


118
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,016
can be optimized
throughout a program


119
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,853
that might include both very
dark and very bright scenes.


120
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,393
The format also carries
a much broader metadata set,


121
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,295
further enabling
the target display


122
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,364
to perform much more detailed
tone mapping


123
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,199
and detail management.


124
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,606
Finally, Dolby operates
a certification program


125
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:16,209
to ensure that each Dolby Vision
capable display is consistent,


126
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,379
so content will always
be displayed as intended.
