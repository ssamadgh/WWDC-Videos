users like power tabs, and tags,


173
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:16,056
and enhanced support
for multiple displays.


174
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:19,536
Advanced technologies
for longer battery life


175
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:20,996
and greater performance.


176
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,556
And of course, new
and improved apps.


177
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:27,866
Just since its release in
October we've installed


178
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,866
over 40 million copies
of Mavericks.


179
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:35,916
This is the most of a single
release ever in Apple's history.


180
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:44,896
Also, that makes over 50 percent
of our installed base working


181
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:47,366
on our latest operating system.


182
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,256
This is the fastest
adoption ever


183
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:56,296
of any PC operating
system in history.


184
00:09:56,416 --> 00:10:00,476
Now, you may wonder how
that compares to Windows.


185
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,066
[ Laughter ]


186
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:05,976
I knew somebody was going to ask
so I decided to make a chart.


187
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:07,476
[ Laughter ]


188
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:11,146
Well, as it turns
out Windows 8 shipped


189
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:15,266
about a year before Mavericks
and it's at 14 percent.


190
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,876
[ Laughter ]


191
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,486
Need I say more?


192
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:28,586
[ Applause ]


193
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,716
So, we could not be happier
with Mavericks and the momentum


194
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,116
of the Mac, but of course
we're always future focused.


195
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:41,526
And today, to talk about
the future of OS X,


196
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:45,106
I'd like to invite my
colleague up, Craig Federighi,


197
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,176
to tell us all about it.


198
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:46,806
Craig.


199
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:52,006
[ Applause ]


200
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:52,996
>> Good morning.


201
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,876
Wow.

[ Applause ]


203
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:05,576
Well, it's wonderful to be here
presenting among the greatest


204
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:07,656
developers collected
in the world.


205
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,336
You guys are fantastic.


206
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:13,176
You know, it was just a
year ago, here at WWDC,


207
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:18,496
when we narrowly averted a
major OS X naming crisis.


208
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:20,756
[ Laughter ]


209
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:25,036
You may remember that we're able
to deftly shift from names based


210
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:29,676
on big cats to names based on
beautiful places in California,


211
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:33,256
starting of course
with OS X Mavericks.


212
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:37,296
Well, it's another year
and time for another name


213
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:41,326
and so we collected our
crack product marketing team,


214
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:46,826
shoved them in their VW Minibus
and set them out on the road.


215
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:51,496
Now, they first ventured south
discovering OS X, Oxnard.


216
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,936
[ Laughter ]


217
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,046
This wasn't quite right.


218
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:58,366
But undeterred, they
headed east,


219
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:01,546
landed in OS X Rancho Cucamonga.


220
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,306
[ Laughter ]


221
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:07,026
Still, we hadn't
quite hit the mark.


222
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:13,306
So, they boldly ventured
north landing at OS X Weed.


223
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,296
[ Laughter ]


224
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:15,976
Now--


225
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:21,256
[ Applause ]


226
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:24,376
Strangely, this one had
large pockets of support


227
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,066
within the product
marketing organization,


228
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:30,946
but saner heads did
prevail and they set off


229
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:34,556
on what then was somewhat
more circuitous path.


230
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:36,316
It took them ultimately
to a place


231
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:39,696
that embodies the
beauty and power of OS X.


232
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,736
We discovered OS X Yosemite.


233
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:54,356
[ Applause ]


234
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:59,906
Now, Yosemite is a fantastic new
release with a new interface,


235
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,066
big enhancements to
our most popular apps


236
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:06,616
and something all knew,
we call Continuity.


237
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:09,866
Now, I want to start
with design.


238
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:14,896
OS X, of course started with
the bold design of Aqua.


239
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:18,096
And over the years, it's evolved


240
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:22,276
to the refined look we all
loved today in Mavericks.


241
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:27,266
Well, with Yosemite, we
continue this evolution and I'd


242
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:31,946
like to give you a look
at where we're headed.


243
00:13:32,516 --> 00:14:27,956
[ Music ]


244
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,976
How about that?


245
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:36,116
[ Applause ]


246
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:39,226
I think the team has done
some remarkable work.


247
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:42,646
You know, we started with the
most fundamental controls,


248
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:47,666
focused always on clarity,
as well as utility.


249
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:53,056
We refined the tool bars
and the window materials


250
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,866
and the window constructions.


251
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,896
If you look at the window title
bar, you'll see how the use


252
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,366
of translucent materials
gives you a sense of place


253
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,786
as you scroll your content.


254
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:05,586
Now, these same carefully
crafted translucent materials


255
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,256
are used in the sidebars.


256
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:12,226
So now, your windows take on
the personality of your desktop.


257
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:16,236
As you change your desktop
picture, your window adapts


258
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:19,016
to reflect that personality
and that temperature.


259
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:23,336
And the translucency also
helps maintain a sense of depth


260
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:27,126
and place as you move your
windows over one another.


261
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:31,506
Now, we also use the same
gorgeous translucent material


262
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:36,666
for the dock and check out these
beautifully crafted new icons.


263
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,716
So clean and yet so
fundamentally still Mac.


264
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:45,076
And check out the trash can,
that is a gorgeous trash can.


265
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:47,246
You wouldn't believe how
much time we spent crafting a


266
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:47,956
trash can.


267
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,076
[ Laughter ]


268
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:52,206
So, we also focused on precise


269
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,356
and consistent typography
throughout.


270
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,766
So, from the menus
to the window chrome


271
00:15:56,766 --> 00:16:00,136
to application control is
consistent and clear type.


272
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:04,476
Now, we know, for our pro users,
often, they really want to focus


273
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,746
on the center on the
screen and not be distracted


274
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,866
by bright menus and
bright docks,


275
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:12,156
so we also introduced
a dark mode.


276
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:17,516
[ Applause ]


277
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:18,756
Lovers of dark.


278
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,606
Yes. So, of course
these changes extend


279
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,336
through to the applications.


280
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:27,876
You notice here, with
Calendar, this construction


281
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:30,266
with a common toolbar
and title bar area


282
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:33,236
that makes the window both
more distinctly recognizable,


283
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,866
but more importantly maximizes
the space available for content.


284
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,016
And we carry this


285
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:41,306
over throughout the
system to apps like Maps.


286
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:45,456
Now, we also have a new look
for sidebar apps, like Messages,


287
00:16:45,456 --> 00:16:47,606
you can see it here with the
beautiful translucent material


288
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:49,366
running top to bottom.


289
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:52,236
And we extend that look
to apps like FaceTime,


290
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,196
Contacts, and Reminders.


291
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:59,046
All in all they come
together for a gorgeous


292
00:16:59,136 --> 00:17:03,486
and more usable version
of OS X, the best ever.


293
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:10,386
[ Applause ]


294
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:13,246
Next, let's talk about
Notification Center.


295
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:16,546
Notification Center
on OS X, of course,


296
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:20,036
adopts the dark translucent
material


297
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:22,586
and precise type of Yosemite.


298
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:26,626
It also now, most importantly,
has a new Today view.


299
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,906
So, you get an at-a-glance
look at your Calendar,


300
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:35,246
your Reminders, Weather, and
more, but most importantly,


301
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:39,226
you can extend the contents of
Today view with the contents


302
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,316
of widgets and apps that you've
downloaded from the App Store.


303
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:46,586
Just add them right in and set
up the Today view, that you want


304
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:48,806
for at-a-glance access
to information.


305
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:52,156
And that is Notification Center.


306
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:57,466

307
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,386
Next up. Spotlight.


308
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:02,436
So Spotlight has always
been a superfast way


309
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:06,236
to launch applications and
find content local on your Mac.


310
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,806
And Yosemite is a
great new interface.


311
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:11,206
So when you click on
the magnifying glass


312
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:12,896
on the toolbar you'll
get a big field right


313
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:14,016
in the middle of the display.


314
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:16,536
And if you just type
a few characters,


315
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:20,136
you can launch an app just
like that, or type the name


316
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:22,826
of a document and you
get great search results


317
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:25,466
and an inline preview,
it's really awesome.


318
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,476
Now, in addition to these
sources, local to your Mac,


319
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:31,986
we also tap into sources of
information on the internet.


320
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:35,796
So for instance, type a few
characters in like Yosemite,


321
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:38,926
you can get news feed,
information from Wikipedia,


322
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:41,946
and even maps all
at your finger tips.


323
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:43,826
I'd like to give
you a quick demo


324
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:45,916
of the new UI in Yosemite now.


325
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:51,836
[ Applause ]


326
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:52,786
All right.


327
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:55,386
So here is our first
look at Yosemite live.


328
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:58,566
So we see our beautiful new
typography in our menus,


329
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:02,606
this gorgeous new dock
and these beautiful icons.


330
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:03,546
Let's launch an app.


331
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:06,316
I'm going to start here with
Maps and I want you to observe


332
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:08,546
that as I scroll the
content of the map,


333
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:12,586
the way that the title bar
actually reacts its translucency


334
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:16,596
and color to the content
beneath is just really gorgeous.


335
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,906
I'm going to launch
now another app.


336
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,256
Calendar. So Calendar has
a new look for a week view


337
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,346
but also an all new day view.


338
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,266
And you notice here on day
view, I have all of my meetings


339
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,176
in the day right
here on the left,


340
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,966
and on the right I got
details about my appointments.


341
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,426
So for instance,
here at 2 o'clock,


342
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,496
we have our executive
karaoke outing,


343
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:39,396
that's going to be big blast.


344
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:40,256
It's right there.


345
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,876
You want to probably drop in
on that if you get the chance.


346
00:19:43,146 --> 00:19:46,126
So let's take a look
now at Messages.


347
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,896
So Messages, you see this use


348
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,236
of the translucent sidebar
material, how it reacts subtly


349
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:54,406
to the background is really
nice, and how the contents


350
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:58,416
of the title bar react as I
scroll content underneath.


351
00:19:59,156 --> 00:19:59,846
It's really cool.


352
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,896
Let's take a look at
Notification Center.


353
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,086
So of course, I have
my notifications here,


354
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:08,646
but I also have Today view
so I can see my Calendar


355
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,206
at a glance, my Weather.


356
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:13,126
These are interactive so I
can click, get hourly weather,


357
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,946
clock, interact with stocks for
instance, or even Reminders.


358
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:19,336
So here I'm supposed to practice
for the demo and I forgot to do


359
00:20:19,336 --> 00:20:20,446
that but it's too late now.


360
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:22,256
So, we'll send out
one on its way.


361
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,956
Now, of course, I can edit
these widgets as well,


362
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:27,446
just click the Edit
button down here


363
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:29,886
and you see widgets available
to me right here on the side.


364
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:32,636
These are all from apps
that can export widgets.


365
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:34,686
So I'm just going to
drag out Calculator,


366
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:38,366
add that in here just like that
or even a third party widget.


367
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,996
Let's drag one of those
in, ESPN SportsCenter.


368
00:20:40,996 --> 00:20:44,766
So right there, I get all my
information right at a glance.


369
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:46,306
It's really awesome.


370
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:52,296
[ Applause ]


371
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:53,956
So next. Spotlight.


372
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,736
So I'm going to click here on
the magnifying glass and, boom,


373
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,946
got a search field right in
the middle of the screen.


374
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,556
I can type just a couple of
characters to launch an app


375
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:02,536
like our new reminders.


376
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:03,806
There it is.


377
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:04,666
It's that easy.


378
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,516
But of course, Spotlight is
great for looking up people too.


379
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,296
So I'm going to look
up Phil Schiller here.


380
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:10,606
There's Phil.


381
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:13,306
And you see I have all of
his contact information here,


382
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:16,256
but I also have matches
on mail from Phil.


383
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:18,356
Phil and I are planning
a camping trip.


384
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,046
He's a bit of a gear nut
and has something he wants


385
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,616
to try out on our trip.


386
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:23,616
We also have Events
and Reminders.


387
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:27,956
So we have here that our Meeting
at the Campsite and-- oh, good.


388
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:31,166
I see that Jeff and Johnny are
both in on the trip as well.


389
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:35,266
And I'll tell you, you just have
not had chili by the campfire


390
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,166
until you've eaten it with one


391
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,976
of Johnny's custom
crafted aluminium spoons.


392
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,296
[ Laughter ]


393
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:42,326
It's a-- it's the diamond
cut chamfered edges


394
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,826
that really make the experience.


395
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:50,606
So, I'm working on a document
as well to help plan our trip.


396
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,616
Now, there are a lot of ways
of course to find documents,


397
00:21:52,616 --> 00:21:53,926
but one way now is by app.


398
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:55,606
So this is a numbers document.


399
00:21:56,036 --> 00:21:58,296
I typed numbers and you
see in addition to the app,


400
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:01,416
I get all my recent documents
that I've opened with that app


401
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:03,116
and I can access
them right here.


402
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:04,636
So let's open up my hiking trip.


403
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:10,656
And here we see that the trip
has planned involved a 16.4 mile


404
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:14,356
hike and you're being an
operations professional.


405
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:16,636
Jeff is a big stickler
for the metric system.


406
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:19,696
And so, fortunately,
Spotlight has my back.


407
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:23,406
I can just type in
16.4 miles here


408
00:22:23,786 --> 00:22:26,636
and I get an instant
conversion to kilometers.


409
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,306
So that's awfully handy.


410
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,926
We do all kinds of conversion.


411
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:32,646
They drop that in, fix
that document right up.


412
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:35,266
[ Applause ]


413
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:35,936
All right.


414
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:38,286
Well, that's enough
for my document.


415
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:41,076
I can also do great searches
like just type a few characters,


416
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:45,336
bang, I've got Yosemite
entry from Wikipedia.


417
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:49,376
I've got news from
various sources.


418
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:51,446
I even have maps right here.


419
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:55,786
Well, you know, I'm looking to
plan a dinner and maybe a movie


420
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:58,006
out and now without
even launching an app,


421
00:22:58,006 --> 00:23:00,266
I can just do a look up
for sushi for instance.


422
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,466
And we see I have maps
results right here,


423
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:05,916
right inside of Spotlight.


424
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,096
And of course, in addition
to map information,


425
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,336
we've got pictures,
great information


426
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,256
from Yelp, it's all right there.


427
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:14,836
And to wrap it up, I want
to go out to a movie.


428
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:17,546
You can just type
in Godzilla here.


429
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:19,396
Oh, there we go, Godzilla.


430
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:22,396
And you see, I have show times


431
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:26,456
where it's playing near me
right here in Spotlight as well

iTunes Store, all in Spotlight.

the new UI of Yosemite.

[ Applause ]


435
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:47,896
So next, iCloud Drive.


436
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:52,336
Now-- OK, intriguing.


437
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:56,396
So, we all know that
documents in the Cloud,


438
00:23:56,506 --> 00:24:00,196
provides a really convenient
way for working with an app


439
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:03,386
that works across all platforms
working on the same document.


440
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,926
But now with iCloud Drive,


441
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:08,336
your Mac in addition will
let you work on those


442

00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,576
all of those folders right
accessible inside of Finder.


444
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,266
And in addition to those
apps that are local


445
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:18,636
to your Mac you can
get a content from apps


446
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:19,636
that you don't have on your Mac,


447
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:21,736
so get a contents
from iOS documents.

But even better, you can
store all of your own files


449

of any sort and organize them
however you wish with folders


450
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:33,476
and tags and they're
synchronized automatically

[ Laughter & Applause ]


458
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,976
Next up. Mail.


459
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:07,876
So, Mail in Yosemite has an
elegant new Yosemite style UI.


460
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:11,176
But we really focused
on the basics,


461
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:16,316
reliable synching fast switching
between mailboxes, quick fetches


462
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,346
of your new mail, the basics.


463
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:22,666
But in addition to that, we want
to address a fundamental problem


464
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:25,976
with email, which is these
days we so often want


465
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:28,196
to send large attachments
whether it's videos


466
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:31,436
or large sets of photos and
we're underpinning one of these,


467
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:34,676
a message saying that our
recipient's mail server can't


468
00:25:34,676 --> 00:25:36,096
take those large attachments.


469
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:37,966
Well, we're solving that problem


470
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:40,506
with the technology
we call Mail Drop.


471
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:45,086
With Mail Drop, instead of
your message bouncing off your


472
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,796
recipient's mail
server, you can elect


473
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,176
to have the attachment
sent encrypted


474
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:52,796
and securely via iCloud
separate from the message


475
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:55,136
and it rendezvous on
the receiving end.


476
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:59,946
So, if your recipient has a Mac,
they get it just like before.


477
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:02,846
And if they have another
client, they get a link


478
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:04,926
to securely download
those attachments.


479
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:08,756
And those attachments can
be up to 5 gigs in size.


480
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,646

Have you ever been working on an
email message and you realized


484
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:26,106
that if you could just
maybe circle something


485
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,676
or write something
on the message,


486
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:29,606

you can get your point

across so much more clearly,
well, now with Markup you can.

to your mail message,


489

and it even works with PDFs.


490
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:41,656
So if you needed, for instance,
sign a PDF, you can now do


491
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:42,836
that with your iSight camera


492
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:45,376
or even drawing your
signature right on the trackpad


493
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,226
and it goes right
into the email message


494
00:26:47,346 --> 00:26:48,846
and you can send on its way.


495
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,346

able to pack all the power

of the Safari UI
into this single bar,


501
00:27:06,736 --> 00:27:10,236

more space for your content.

wonder what happened

that back if you want to.

don't really need

00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,786
in your smart search
suggestions,


511
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,566
you also get spotlight
suggestions right there


512
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,646
in your completion menu.


513
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:39,126
And this means, you can get
things faster than ever before.


514
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:43,226
Now, Safari is also more
powerful than ever with sharing.


515
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:47,516
So now, if you want to subscribe
to an RSS feed on the site,


516
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,496
you can do that right here


517
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,916
and those RSS feed
articles will show up right


518
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,446
in your Safari sidebar
under Shared Links.


519
00:27:54,836 --> 00:27:58,206
And you can also share to
people more quickly than ever,


520
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:00,316
because Safari lists the
people you've message


521
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:03,776
with most recently, and with
just one click you can share


522
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:04,516
a webpage.


523
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:09,676
Now, Safari is better than
ever as well with tabs.


524
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:13,636
We now have a tab view that
gives you a bird's-eye glance


525
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:18,066
of all of your tabs and it
stacks tabs from sites just


526
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,076
like this so you get
individual stacks


527
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:22,266
for each site that
you're browsing.


528
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:26,196
Safari is also great
when it comes to privacy.


529
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:29,136
Safari was the first browser
to introduce private browsing


530
00:28:29,196 --> 00:28:30,896
and now it's easier than ever,


531
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:33,596
because you can create
a new private window.


532
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,796
And when you do, all the
content within that window


533
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:39,586
and all its tabs
stay private and all


534
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:42,116
of your other windows
are unaffected.


535
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:43,396
It's really handy.


536
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:47,106
Now, Safari is great when
it comes to standards.


537
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:50,836
It has WebGL now for
superfast 3D graphics,


538
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:55,956
SPDY for efficient networking,
and HTML Premium Video.


539
00:28:56,456 --> 00:29:01,346
Now, this enables modern Macs
to efficiently stream video


540
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:03,726
from site like Netflix
without a plug-in


541
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:05,556
and the results are awesome.


542
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,986
You get up to two hours
longer battery life


543
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:11,376
on a MacBook Air
streaming Netflix.


544
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,636
And that's for 1080P video.


545
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:17,766
Now, Safari has been
set the benchmark really


546
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,956
for energy efficiency
since Mavericks


547
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:22,626
and its lead here continues.


548
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,986
When it comes to multi-tab
browser energy efficiency,


549
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,986
Safari is without equal.


550
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:30,556
And when it comes to the
kind of UI manipulations


551
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:34,486
that are typical in web apps,
Safari is faster than ever.


552
00:29:35,386 --> 00:29:36,706
And how about JavaScript?


553
00:29:36,946 --> 00:29:39,866
Well, take the most complex kind
of JavaScript that's typical


554
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:41,946
of very rich web applications.


555
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:47,466
Well, Safari now has a Fourth
Tier LLVM-based optimized


556
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:51,716
JavaScript Compiler that is the
fastest of any major browser.


557
00:29:52,346 --> 00:29:55,866
And when it comes to
typical website JavaScript,


558
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:59,136
Safari is in a league
of its own.


559
00:29:59,976 --> 00:30:00,966
So of that is Safari.


560
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:03,516
And to give you a quick
demo, I'd like to bring


561
00:30:03,516 --> 00:30:05,176
up Brian Crowe to the stage.


562
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:05,826
Let's give him a big welcome.


563
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:05,976
Brian.


564
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:11,196
[ Applause ]


565
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:12,196
>> Thanks Craig.


566
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:15,786
I'm really happy
to be here today.


567
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:18,586
So, I'm just going to
dive right into Safari.


568
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:19,646
Here we go.


569
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,876
It's really great.


570
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:25,496
And when you go to a website,


571
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,276
you can really appreciate
the new design.


572
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:32,196
It's simpler and it's
even more powerful.


573
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:36,326
I can open up the sidebar really
easily to get at my Bookmarks,


574
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:39,216
my Reading List as well
as my Shared Links.


575
00:30:40,136 --> 00:30:46,036
And when I click into the Search
field, I get instant access


576
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:47,696
to all my favorite sites.


577
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:49,256
It's really nice.


578
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:50,966
So, I'm going to
go ahead and type


579
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:53,426
in a search for Ansel Adams.


580
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:54,086
There we go.


581
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:57,266
And if I hit return,
I can just go


582
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:58,686
to a regular old Google search.


583
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:03,946
But, since Ansel Adams
is a common search term,


584
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:08,246
I get this new Spotlight
suggestion there at the top.


585
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:11,136
It has a snippet of
information from Wikipedia.


586
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,476
I can read it there, or
if I'd like I can go ahead


587
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,016
and see the entire article
right on the Wikipedia site.


588
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:20,346
It's super convenient.


589
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:25,636
Now, if you use tabs,
you're going to love this.


590
00:31:26,996 --> 00:31:29,896
Now, no matter how many
tabs I have opened,


591
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,946
I can smoothly scroll
through them to get at any


592
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,126
of that tab I'm looking for.


593
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:36,616
It's really nice.


594
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,091
[ Applause ]


595
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:42,766
So now, sometimes I want to
see my tabs so I can go ahead


596
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,646
and do this and I'll click
on the new Tab View button.


597
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:48,976
And there you go, a
beautiful bird's eye view


598
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:50,096
of all my open tabs.


599
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:53,026
So, I'm going to go ahead
and select this one here.


600
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:57,066
It's a photoblog with a
bunch of pictures of Yosemite


601
00:31:57,066 --> 00:32:00,726
and there's a couple of good
ones of El Capitan down below.


602
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:02,816
So, I'll find in
there El Capitan.


603
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,936
And then I'm going
to choose this one.


604
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:06,476
Now, I want to share it
with Craig so I'm going


605
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:07,636
to get the high-res image.


606
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:10,596
Now, sharing couldn't
be easier in Safari.


607
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,586
I just simply click on
the Share button here,


608
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:16,776
and now I can use the new
recent recipients feature


609
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:18,676
to address it to Craig.


610
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:19,676
And here we go.


611
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:24,336
And with just one click, I'm
ready to send that image.


612
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:25,486
It's that easy.


613
00:32:26,536 --> 00:32:28,976
So-- But before I send it,


614
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:30,736
I'm going to add my
two cents to this.


615
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:33,496
So, I can go here and we
have just the right feature


616
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:34,876
called Markup.


617
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:38,536
Now with Markup, I
can edit this image


618
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:40,256
without ever even leaving Mail.


619
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:41,926
It's really great.


620
00:32:42,416 --> 00:32:45,336
So, what I'm going to do
is annotate this image


621
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:48,346
with a nice magnifying
glass a loop.


622
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,546
So, you move it around
you can say


623
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,246
that it magnifies
everything underneath it.


624
00:32:52,246 --> 00:32:54,026
So, I'm going to
place it right here.


625
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:57,266
And it turns out
that those two specs


626
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,876
on the big granite face there,
they're actually climbers.


627
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:01,936
It's kind of crazy.


628
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,456
So, I'm going to
zoom it a little more


629
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:04,556
so you can see it better.


630
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:05,416
There we go.


631
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:08,116
So, I can zoom nicely
and place it here.


632
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:11,616
Now, I want to point this
out to Craig in the mail.


633
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:16,306
And I can use my trackpad
to draw on the image.


634
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:18,406
So, I'm going to go ahead
and draw an arrow here.


635
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:19,786
There we go.


636
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:24,646
And you notice Markup's smart
enough to recognize the arrow


637
00:33:25,076 --> 00:33:26,246
and make it really pretty.


638
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:32,566
So now-- now, it's really
easy to add a comment.


639
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:36,026
And so, check out the climbers.


640
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:37,986
There we go.


641
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:41,346
Now, I can have a little
fun with this, so I'm going


642
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:45,006
to go ahead and create
a cartoon bubble, OK?


643
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,866
I'm not so good at drawing
but Markup's going to help me.


644
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:49,496
There we go.


645
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:52,096
So, luckily you can
clean that up [phonetic],


646
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:52,926
it's better than I am.


647
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:55,196
So now I can add a caption.


648
00:33:56,086 --> 00:33:57,826
And so, I think I'm
going to appeal


649
00:33:57,826 --> 00:33:59,706
to the inner developer
and all of us.


650
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:05,106
I'm going to type in
"I hope the rope is,"


651
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:08,376
wait for it, "multithreaded."


652
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:11,906
Yeah.


653
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:15,216
[ Laughter ]


654
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:18,056
OK. So, I think I've done
enough to this picture.


655
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:20,436
Time to go.


656
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:23,326
So, now it's ready
for me to mail


657
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:25,275
and I can just click like that.


658
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:29,076
So that's how easy it is
to Markup an image in Mail.


659
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,275
So, those are just a couple


660
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:33,936
of great new features
in Safari in Mail.


661
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:34,866
Thank you.


662
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:43,255

663
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:45,525
>> How about that
parallel programming joke.


664
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:46,646
You did not see that coming.


665
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:52,396
Next, something entirely
different.


666
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:54,176
It's called the Continuity.


667
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:56,946
So now at Apple, we
believe you should be able


668
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,446
to use the right
device for the moment.


669
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:04,016
Maybe your phone when you're on
the go, your iPad when you want


670
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:06,216
to kick back on the
couch, or maybe your Mac


671
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,096
when you're trying to
get some work done.


672
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:11,766
But we also want the transitions
between these moments


673
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:15,916
to be absolutely as natural
and seamless as possible.


674
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:19,486
Now, our Continuity features
start with something simple


675
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:22,856
and that's AirDrop,
because now AirDrop works


676
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:23,926
between iOS and the Mac.

[ Applause ]


678
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,426
It's really convenient.


679
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,886
But now we have something
that we really take it


680
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,426
to the next level and
that's called Handoff.


681
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:45,306
So, it turns out now that when
you're working on your Mac,


682
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:50,266
your devices around you
in proximity are aware


683
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:53,166
of each other and aware
of what you're up to.


684
00:35:53,656 --> 00:35:56,426
And so, if you want to pick up
where you left off on your Mac


685
00:35:56,546 --> 00:35:59,766
and your iPad, your iPad
is prompting you right


686
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,296
in the lower left of the screen.


687
00:36:01,566 --> 00:36:04,656
Just swipe up and you
can pick up working


688
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:06,946
on what you're working on
your Mac right on your iPad.


689
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:08,486
And this--

691
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:16,096
This works in the other
direction as well.


692
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:20,066
So, let's say, you're
composing an email on your phone


693
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,926
and you walk up to your Mac.


694
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:24,576
Well, your Mac will
notice what you're doing


695
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,366
and prompt you right
on the dock.


696
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:29,336
You click it and you
can pick up finishing


697
00:36:29,336 --> 00:36:30,846
that message right on your Mac.

[ Applause ]


699
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:41,426
Now, we've been able to take
this same proximity awareness


700
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:45,306
and make the process of
creating a hotspot easier


701
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:46,196
than ever before.


702
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:49,556
So now, if you're using your Mac
and you're away from a network


703
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:52,836
but your phone is nearby, when
you go up to your Wi-Fi menu,

00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:56,226
your Mac, actually without any
configuration ever have been


705
00:36:56,226 --> 00:36:59,986
done on your phone, sees
your phone and prompts you


706
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:02,836
so you click it and it
automatically sets up a hotspot.


707
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:04,236
You never type a
password and you're


708
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:05,516
on the network that easily.

710
00:37:11,656 --> 00:37:13,466
And this works even
if your phone is


711

across the room sitting
in a handbag.


712
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,656
You just never have to touch it.


713
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:20,796
Now, the next that we really
wanted to handle is SMS.


714
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:25,126
Now, we all love iMessage.


715
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,136
We can continue our
conversations seamlessly


716
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:30,296
from device to device but
then we have these green


717

bubble friends.


718
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:37,956
And, you know, they have
inferior devices and they insist


719
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,596
on sending us messages,
and we don't want


720
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:40,406
to hold it against them.


721
00:37:40,406 --> 00:37:43,586
But the problem is that
those messages don't show


722
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:48,966
up on our other devices
until now, because now--

and transparently send your
messages between devices.


726
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:00,556
Now, believe it or not,


727
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:04,826
we're able to do the same
thing with phone calls.


728
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:09,346
So now, when you
receive a phone call,


729
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:14,316
your Mac gives you caller ID
and you can even accept the call


730
00:38:14,316 --> 00:38:15,986
and use your Mac
as a speaker phone.

[ Applause ]


732
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:30,306
And believe it or not, this
works even if your phone is

across the house in a charger.


734
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:34,696
You never have to miss a call.


735
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:39,256
Well, now that your
Mac is all phone savvy,


736
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:41,006
it's also a great way
to dial the phone.


737
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:43,746
So, if you're in Contacts and
you want to dial a number,


738
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:45,386
you can do it right there.


739
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,516
And even on a webpage, you
see a number you want to call,


740
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:50,986
you can call it right
from your Mac.


741
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:52,826

up my iPhone here.

about our karaoke night.

go-- and you know,

some inspiration

to experience at karaoke night,

to go dial a phone number

00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:58,036
as well which is we're
having a public beta program.


850
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:01,976
So, if you're a non-developer
and you want


851
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:05,516
to help us improve Yosemite,
you can sign up on the web


852
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,306
and you can receive access


853
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:10,756
to Yosemite betas
throughout the summer.


854
00:44:11,286 --> 00:44:13,386
That is OS X Yosemite.


855
00:44:14,326 --> 00:44:15,116
I think you're going to love it.


856
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:15,776
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.


857
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:15,956
Thank you.


858
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:18,046
[ Applause ]


859
00:44:18,076 --> 00:44:18,866
>> Thank, Craig.


860
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:25,546
[ Applause ]


861
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,066
It's a really terrific release.


862
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:28,976
I'm just glad I'm
in the beta program.


863
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:31,151
[ Laughter ]


864
00:44:31,286 --> 00:44:32,846
Next up is iOS.


865
00:44:33,516 --> 00:44:36,486
[ Applause ]


866
00:44:36,986 --> 00:44:44,146
We've now sold well over 800
million iOS devices and each


867
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:47,936
of the categories of devices has
set its own significant sales


868
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,206
record in the past year.


869
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:53,776
iPod Touch has passed
100 million units.


870
00:44:54,686 --> 00:44:57,666
iPad has passed 200
million units.


871
00:44:58,716 --> 00:45:02,316
And iPhone has passed
half a billion units.


872
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:04,816
This is incredible.


873
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:10,556
But what's even more impressive
is how many new customers


874
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:14,186
to Apple that iOS
devices has brought to us.


875
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:22,026
Over 130 million customers
who bought an iOS device


876
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:27,866
in the past 12 months was
buying their first Apple device.


877
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:34,116
[ Applause ]


878
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:40,296
Now, many of these customers
were switchers from Android.


879
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:47,976
They had bought an
Android phone by mistake.


880
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:50,111
[ Laughter ]


881
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:55,586
And then had sought a better
experience and a better life.


882
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:58,221
[ Laughter ]


883
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:03,636
And decided to check
out iPhone and iOS.


884
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:09,626
Nearly, in fact, nearly half
of our customers in China


885
00:46:09,626 --> 00:46:14,386
in the past six months
switched from Android to iPhone.


886
00:46:15,836 --> 00:46:17,946
This is incredible and of course


887
00:46:17,946 --> 00:46:21,366
that better experience
is our devices in iOS.


888
00:46:22,786 --> 00:46:26,636
And iOS 7 took that
experience to even higher level.


889
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:32,606
The customer sat with iOS
7 is really off the charts.


890
00:46:33,406 --> 00:46:37,216
Change wave recently
measured it at 97 percent.


891
00:46:38,656 --> 00:46:42,036
These are customer sat
ratings that no one gets.


892
00:46:43,276 --> 00:46:44,956
It's really enormous.


893
00:46:46,026 --> 00:46:53,806
Now, one of the reasons why
customers say they love iOS is


894
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:57,946
that we make available
our software updates


895
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:02,346
for the OS available to as
many customers as possible.


896
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:07,416
And, if you look at what
has happened with iOS 7,


897
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:11,856
our latest release,
almost 9 out of 10 people


898
00:47:11,856 --> 00:47:15,976
in our install base are running
our latest operating system.


899
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:22,436
[ Applause ]


900
00:47:22,936 --> 00:47:25,976
Now, this is in stark
contrast to Android.


901
00:47:26,436 --> 00:47:28,436
[ Laughter ]


902
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:33,406
If you look at their latest
release, less than one out of 10


903
00:47:33,406 --> 00:47:37,036
of their customers are
on their latest software.


904
00:47:37,636 --> 00:47:43,706
And, if you look at a
broader group, over a third


905
00:47:43,706 --> 00:47:47,006
of their customers
are running a version


906
00:47:47,006 --> 00:47:51,196
of Android from four years ago.


907
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:53,946
That's like ancient history.


908
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:57,126
[ Laughter ]


909
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:02,626
Now, that means that these
customers are not getting great


910
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:03,496
new features.


911
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:06,756
They're not able to
run your latest apps.


912
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:10,886
And, they don't get
security updates


913
00:48:11,616 --> 00:48:13,666
that they may need to stay safe.


914
00:48:15,146 --> 00:48:17,966
And, this is particularly
important for Android


915
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:20,976
which dominates the
mobile malware market.


916
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:24,136
[ Laughter ]


917
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:28,206
No wonder experts are
saying things like this.


918
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:31,936
Android fragmentation
is turning devices


919
00:48:31,936 --> 00:48:35,726
into a toxic hell stew
of vulnerabilities.


920
00:48:37,196 --> 00:48:44,206
Now, fortunately, iOS hasn't
had this kind of issues


921
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:49,136
because we do everything we can
to make our updates available


922
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:51,376
to as many people as possible.


923
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:57,846
So, we could not be
happier with iOS 7


924
00:48:58,446 --> 00:49:00,726
and the momentum of iOS devices.


925
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:04,146
But, we are not standing still.


926
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:07,976
Today, we're announcing iOS 8.


927
00:49:08,516 --> 00:49:15,556
[ Applause ]


928
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:19,586
And, iOS 8 is a giant release


929
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:22,536
and it's really two
stories not one.


930
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:26,196
It has great end user features.


931
00:49:27,536 --> 00:49:32,006
But, it also has
incredible developer features


932
00:49:32,376 --> 00:49:36,856
so you can extend your
experience and build apps


933
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:38,586
that you couldn't do before.


934
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:43,336
We'd like to get started with
describing it with talking


935
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:45,096
about the end user features.


936
00:49:45,456 --> 00:49:48,256
And, to do that, I'd
like to bring Craig back


937
00:49:48,256 --> 00:49:48,636
up to the stage.


938
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:48,976
Craig?


939
00:49:49,516 --> 00:49:56,546
[ Applause ]


940
00:49:57,046 --> 00:49:57,626
>> I missed you guys.


941
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:02,736
So, what? Let's talk
about iOS 8.


942
00:50:03,296 --> 00:50:07,316
Now, iOS 8 of course builds
on the design of iOS 7


943
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:11,686
with enhancements for
both iPhone and iPad.


944
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:13,316
And, let's start with the phone.


945
00:50:14,336 --> 00:50:17,766
Now, in iOS 8, we've
refined notification center.


946
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:23,626
But, what I really love are our
new interactive notifications.


947
00:50:24,186 --> 00:50:27,856
So now, if you get a message
like this, just pull down


948
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:30,896
and you can reply from
right where you are.


949
00:50:31,036 --> 00:50:33,036
[ Applause ]


950
00:50:33,056 --> 00:50:34,706
You don't have to leave
the app you're in.


951
00:50:34,706 --> 00:50:37,546
And this works for all
kinds of notifications.


952
00:50:37,546 --> 00:50:40,316
If you get a calendar event
for instance, just pull down


953
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:43,546
and respond and it works
on the lock screen.


954
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,276
So, you can just swipe
across in the lock screen.


955
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,706
You get those action
buttons tapped


956
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,826
and you've dealt
with it right there.


957
00:50:50,836 --> 00:50:54,966
Now, in iOS 7, we gave you
quick double-tap access to get


958
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:56,186
at your most recent apps.


959
00:50:56,936 --> 00:51:00,386
Well now, you can also use
that same double tap to get


960
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:03,396
at the people you communicate
with most frequently.


961
00:51:03,996 --> 00:51:04,996
It's really handy.


962
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:09,746
And, in iOS 7, we introduce
this great Tab View in Safari.


963
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:13,916
Well, we're bringing a great
Tab View to iPad as well


964
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:16,626
with this bird's eye
view of all of your tabs.


965
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:21,156
And, Safari also picks up
the Side Bar that we love


966
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:24,726
in Yosemite with access to your
bookmarks, your reading list


967
00:51:24,926 --> 00:51:25,846
and your shared links.


968
00:51:26,676 --> 00:51:30,066
Now, we've made managing your
mail easier than ever before.


969
00:51:30,406 --> 00:51:32,566
So now, if you're reading a
message, you want to remember


970
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:34,266
to get back to it so you're
going to mark it on red.


971
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:36,456
We can do that with
just a single gesture.


972
00:51:37,356 --> 00:51:39,256
And, if you want
to flag a message,


973
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:41,306
you can just pull across,
there's a flag option.


974
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,576
But, if you pull
all the way across,


975
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,866
you can delete with
just a gesture.


976
00:51:45,656 --> 00:51:48,396
But the piece I love the
best is what we've done


977
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,696
with composing messages.


978
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:52,306
Have you ever found
yourself composing an email


979
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,006
and then you really wish like
you get at something else


980
00:51:55,006 --> 00:51:56,726
in your inbox maybe
for that reply?


981
00:51:57,686 --> 00:51:58,526
Well now, you can.


982
00:51:58,626 --> 00:52:01,946
Just swipe that message
down and you have access


983
00:52:01,946 --> 00:52:02,886
to the rest of your mail.


984
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:09,166
[ Applause ]


985
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,116
So, I'd like to give
you a demo of some


986
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:15,476
of these great iOS
8 enhancements now.


987
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:21,666
So, here we are on
our iOS 8 lock screen.


988
00:52:22,546 --> 00:52:24,426
And, if I receive
a notification,


989
00:52:24,426 --> 00:52:26,526
it looks like I happen to
get one just right then,


990
00:52:26,806 --> 00:52:30,756
I can swipe across and you see
I have action so I can accept


991
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:32,046
or decline this meeting
right here.


992
00:52:32,046 --> 00:52:35,466
And, of course, I'm
going to use the device,


993
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:39,416
if I'm in here maybe playing
some music here on iTunes radio,


994
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:42,476
I might get a notification.


995
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:47,356
And, if I do get notification, I
can just swipe down on it, too.


996
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:49,046
So, here's one, just swipe down.


997
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,256
Now, I get access
to my keyboard.


998
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,736
I can type right there.


999
00:52:54,396 --> 00:52:56,606
Now, this works great for
third party apps as well.


1000
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,876
So, for instance, looks like
I got tagged on Facebook,


1001
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:03,906
I can like it right here with
an actionable notification.


1002
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:06,066
And, sometimes, you
receive notifications


1003
00:53:06,066 --> 00:53:07,876
that you just really don't
want deal with right now


1004
00:53:07,876 --> 00:53:10,796
and you can just flick
those away like that.


1005
00:53:11,256 --> 00:53:11,986
That's really handy.


1006
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:15,776
Now, we've made getting at
people easier than ever before.


1007
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,366
So, if I just double-tap
my Home button,


1008
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:20,776
so I have all the people I most
recently communicated with.


1009
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:23,866
I swipe to the side and I have
access to all my favorites.


1010
00:53:24,456 --> 00:53:27,746
If I tap on one, I have controls
here to give them a phone call,


1011
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:32,246
iMessage them or even
FaceTime right here


1012
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:35,096
with just a double-tap
on the Home button.


1013
00:53:35,386 --> 00:53:36,236
It's really handy.


1014
00:53:37,036 --> 00:53:38,086
Now, I want to show you some


1015
00:53:38,086 --> 00:53:39,826
of the enhancements
we made to mail.


1016
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:42,776
Let's go take a look an
iPad actually this time.


1017
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:45,226
So, here we are on iPad.


1018
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:46,976
I'm going to launch mail.


1019
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:50,446
Now, I have a number
of unread messages here


1020
00:53:50,446 --> 00:53:51,826
so let's work our
way through them.


1021
00:53:52,156 --> 00:53:56,516
Here's a message from Open
Table with a dinner appointment.


1022
00:53:56,516 --> 00:54:01,196
And, you notice that the
reservation is actually called


1023
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,176
out right here on the top.


1024
00:54:02,556 --> 00:54:05,026
Mail has actually given me an
intelligent suggestion here


1025
00:54:05,066 --> 00:54:06,096
to add it to my calendar.


1026
00:54:06,096 --> 00:54:08,806
I can tap Add and just
like this, it lets--


1027
00:54:08,806 --> 00:54:12,246
it prompts me to fill out and
add an event to my calendar.


1028
00:54:12,456 --> 00:54:13,266
That's really handy.


1029
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:15,876
Now, sometimes, you
get a message like this


1030
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:18,156
where you're going to have
to do some thinking about it.


1031
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:19,246
Maybe get back to it later.


1032
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:23,226
Well now, with just a single
swipe, I can mark it as unread.


1033
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:24,596
It's really cool.


1034
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:27,176
You can also flag really easily.


1035
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:29,276
So, this is a message
I want to flag.


1036
00:54:29,276 --> 00:54:31,806
Just flick it across and flag.


1037
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:33,686
Now, here's a nice message.


1038
00:54:33,926 --> 00:54:36,806
I don't know who this fellow is
but he says great collaboration.


1039
00:54:37,216 --> 00:54:39,946
You and Johnny have really
come together really well.


1040
00:54:40,246 --> 00:54:41,226
Let's take a look at that one.


1041
00:54:42,356 --> 00:54:42,976
Oh, dear God.

[ Laughter ]


1043
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:45,466
Well, this would be a good time


1044
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:47,196
to demonstrate our
quick delete feature.


1045
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:50,366
So, I can drag all the way
across and delete at a glance.


1046
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,716
I'm certain that
message won't haunt me


1047
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:54,076
on the internet for
years to come.


1048
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,786
So, let's talk about composing.


1049
00:54:56,786 --> 00:55:00,286
I got a message here from a
friend who's visiting in town,


1050
00:55:00,286 --> 00:55:01,386
who's looking for
a good restaurant.


1051
00:55:01,386 --> 00:55:02,856
So, I'll start replying
to this message.


1052
00:55:03,856 --> 00:55:08,226
And, I'll say, let's see--
check out and then, you know,


1053
00:55:08,226 --> 00:55:09,936
actually I got a
good recommendation


1054
00:55:09,936 --> 00:55:11,336
from another friend
here in my inbox,


1055
00:55:11,336 --> 00:55:12,426
so I'd like to get to that now.


1056
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:15,546
Well, I can just swipe
this draft down like this.


1057
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,956
Go right into another
place, another message


1058
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:22,366
in my inbox, tap
out a selection.


1059
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,756
That looks like exactly
what I want to send him


1060
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:25,806
so I'll just copy that.


1061
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:27,396
And now, with a tap
at the bottom,


1062
00:55:27,396 --> 00:55:30,106
I restore my draft
just like that.


1063
00:55:30,656 --> 00:55:33,446
I can paste and send
it on its way.


1064
00:55:33,446 --> 00:55:36,026
I think we're all going to
love doing mail this way.


1065
00:55:36,316 --> 00:55:38,696
That's a quick look, few
enhancements to iOS 8.

[ Applause ]


1067
00:55:44,176 --> 00:55:45,716
So, let's talk about Spotlight.


1068
00:55:46,406 --> 00:55:48,756
And of course, Spotlight
is a super convenient way


1069
00:55:48,756 --> 00:55:49,626
to search in your device.


1070
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:51,566
You just pull down one
on your home screen


1071
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:53,256
and you can execute
these searches,


1072
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:56,586
find things like launching
apps or find an email message.


1073
00:55:57,046 --> 00:56:00,176
But now, with those same things
we showed you in Yosemite,


1074
00:56:00,176 --> 00:56:03,386
with Spotlight Suggestions,
you can get it so much more.


1075
00:56:03,926 --> 00:56:06,736
You can search for apps and find
matches of apps that you don't


1076
00:56:06,736 --> 00:56:08,066
yet have on the App Store.


1077
00:56:09,016 --> 00:56:10,606
You can search for
points of interest


1078
00:56:11,006 --> 00:56:13,296
and get Wikipedia
entries and directions.


1079
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:18,916
You can search for news,
search for restaurants, songs,


1080
00:56:19,156 --> 00:56:21,716
not just in your own
library but also on iTunes.


1081
00:56:21,926 --> 00:56:25,146
And, when you search for a
movie, you can get results both


1082
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:30,286
for theaters nearby as well as
content available for streaming.


1083
00:56:30,826 --> 00:56:34,926
And, when you search
inside of Safari in addition


1084
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:36,606
to your great Google
Search suggestions,


1085
00:56:37,256 --> 00:56:39,626
you can also get a
suggestion at a glance


1086
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:41,496
for the answer you're
looking for right


1087
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:43,136
from Spotlight Suggestions.


1088
00:56:43,706 --> 00:56:45,476
So, that is the new Spotlight.


1089
00:56:46,146 --> 00:56:50,606
Next, the keyboard and the
technology we call QuickType.


1090
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:52,506
Oh.


1091
00:56:53,016 --> 00:56:54,776
[ Laughter ]


1092
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:58,706
So, prior to iPhone, this
was the state-of-the-art


1093
00:56:59,126 --> 00:57:00,326
in smartphone typing.


1094
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:04,156
But, iPhone changed all of that
with the introduction of Touch.


1095
00:57:04,156 --> 00:57:07,456
And, we've been able to do
so much more like access


1096
00:57:07,556 --> 00:57:10,966
to special characters or
alternate character sets,


1097
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:15,756
special keyboard layouts, even
handwriting and dictation.


1098
00:57:16,426 --> 00:57:20,376
But, underlying it all have
been the language models


1099
00:57:20,696 --> 00:57:22,226
under autocorrect.


1100
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:28,166
Well now, in iOS 8,
QuickType supports predictive


1101
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:29,496
typing suggestions.


1102
00:57:29,686 --> 00:57:32,576
So, as you type,
you get suggestions


1103
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:34,606
for the next words you
might want to type,


1104
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:37,976
and you can tap things out
faster than ever before


1105
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,566
and it's incredibly smart.


1106
00:57:40,306 --> 00:57:42,386
So, it's context sensitive.


1107
00:57:42,386 --> 00:57:44,286
For instance in messages,
if someone asks you,


1108
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:45,576
do you want to go for
dinner or a movie?


1109
00:57:45,576 --> 00:57:47,976

dinner or a movie.

And, it's personalized.


1112
00:57:58,146 --> 00:57:59,316
It learns how you type


1113
00:57:59,596 --> 00:58:01,776
to different people
in different apps.


1114
00:58:01,836 --> 00:58:04,416
So, maybe you're communicating
with a co-worker and it's going


1115
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:07,466
to say, well, the meeting was
canceled, rescheduled, moved.


1116
00:58:07,466 --> 00:58:09,456
These are kind of formal terms.


1117
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:11,236
But now, if you're
communicating with someone else,


1118
00:58:11,236 --> 00:58:13,006
we have a different
communication style,


1119
00:58:13,906 --> 00:58:17,376
you might get the meeting was
epic, awesome or a snoozer


1120
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:19,086
because it learns how you type.


1121
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:22,246
And, when it does, it does


1122
00:58:22,246 --> 00:58:25,216
so in a way that's always
protecting your privacy.


1123
00:58:25,696 --> 00:58:28,316
All that learning is done
local to the device and none


1124
00:58:28,316 --> 00:58:30,556
of your keystrokes
leave the device.


1125
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:33,666
Now, QuickType has
great language models


1126
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:34,966
for all of these languages.

up where you left
off on your iPhone.

You can receive your

about participants
in the message.


1183
01:01:07,276 --> 01:01:10,946
For one, Craig and Kim decided
to share their location with me.


1184
01:01:11,136 --> 01:01:12,616
So Craig of course
is up here with us


1185
01:01:12,616 --> 01:01:16,886
in San Francisco while Kim is
working hard back in Cupertino.


1186
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:17,816
Thanks Kim for that.


1187
01:01:18,076 --> 01:01:20,776
One of the things I
can do is add contacts.


1188
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:22,676
I can add people to this
conversation as we go,


1189
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:25,276
but I can also choose
to share my location.


1190
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:27,326
So if I just tap and Share
My Location, I can choose


1191
01:01:27,326 --> 01:01:30,356
to share my location for an
hour for the rest of the day


1192
01:01:30,356 --> 01:01:33,526
or I can keep sharing it until
I stop somewhere in the future.


1193
01:01:33,976 --> 01:01:37,226
But what's really convenient
is this Do Not Disturb button.


1194
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:38,856
How many times you've
been in one


1195
01:01:38,856 --> 01:01:41,296
of those super chatty
group conversations


1196
01:01:41,296 --> 01:01:42,796
that your phone is
just continuing


1197
01:01:42,796 --> 01:01:44,176
to buzz over and over?


1198
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,816
Well now, I can just
choose to Do Not Disturb


1199
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:49,736
that particular thread and
not get my phone buzzing.


1200
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:51,616
So, I'm going to find
that useful with Kim


1201
01:01:51,616 --> 01:01:52,866
and Craig, I know that for sure.


1202
01:01:54,196 --> 01:01:55,896
Or I can even Leave
this Conversation


1203
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:56,876
with just a single tap.


1204
01:01:57,406 --> 01:01:58,886
What's also convenient
is the fact


1205
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:01,606
that I have all the
attachments, all the photos


1206
01:02:01,606 --> 01:02:03,706
from this conversation
all in one place.


1207
01:02:03,706 --> 01:02:07,206
So they still appear in line
in the thread but now instead


1208
01:02:07,206 --> 01:02:09,506
of trying to find that picture
by scrolling, scrolling,


1209
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:12,246
scrolling, they all come in
one place here in the thread,


1210
01:02:12,356 --> 01:02:13,566
so very, very convenient.


1211
01:02:13,726 --> 01:02:15,496
So let's go back to
that conversation,


1212
01:02:15,496 --> 01:02:16,806
Kim had asked me how it's going.


1213
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,756
Well, I have lots of
ways to reply to her.


1214
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:21,316
I could tap out which just
a few taps and, you know,


1215
01:02:21,316 --> 01:02:23,216
use my predictive
keyboard, a message.


1216
01:02:23,596 --> 01:02:26,716
But it's even cooler that I can
now do an audio or video message


1217
01:02:26,716 --> 01:02:28,106
to her with just a swipe.


1218
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:31,756
So I'll send back an
audio message to her.


1219
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:35,776
Hey Kim, I'm just hanging
out here with about 6,000


1220
01:02:35,776 --> 01:02:36,796
of our closest friends.


1221
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:39,046
Having a good time while
Craig takes a much deserved


1222
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:39,986
break backstage.


1223
01:02:40,586 --> 01:02:43,766
Slide up, sends the
message just like that.


1224
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:45,026
Super easy.


1225
01:02:45,276 --> 01:02:47,206
And I can do the same
thing with a video message


1226
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:48,246
or even with a selfie.


1227
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:50,046
So I'm going to dare
a selfie here.


1228
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:52,446
It's all down the camera button.


1229
01:02:54,516 --> 01:03:02,126
[ Laughter & Applause ]


1230
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:03,586
Not my best look.


1231
01:03:03,586 --> 01:03:06,416
Let's see what Kim
has to say about that.


1232
01:03:06,486 --> 01:03:08,866
So, I can-- see, I got an
audio message from Kim,


1233
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:11,096
all I have to do is tap the play
button and hear the message.


1234
01:03:11,936 --> 01:03:12,896
>> Impressive Jos.


1235
01:03:12,896 --> 01:03:15,136
You've totally mastered
the duck face selfie.


1236
01:03:16,466 --> 01:03:17,906
>> Well, I'm glad she likes it.


1237
01:03:18,476 --> 01:03:21,506
So it's super duper easy
to do this sort of things.


1238
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,486
You notice that it said it
would expire in a couple


1239
01:03:23,486 --> 01:03:25,076
of minutes 'cause you don't
want to have this clean this up.


1240
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:27,126
Audio and video messages
can take up space


1241
01:03:27,126 --> 01:03:28,606
so it self-destruct
unless you choose


1242
01:03:28,606 --> 01:03:29,716
to keep-- whoa, what's this?


1243
01:03:30,616 --> 01:03:31,896
So Craig should be backstage


1244
01:03:31,896 --> 01:03:34,106
but he apparently has sent me a
message and it looks important.


1245
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:35,296
So if you don't mind I'm
going to play it back.


1246
01:03:35,296 --> 01:03:37,776
And I can play it back in line
even with a video message here.


1247
01:03:38,286 --> 01:03:42,386
>> Jos, we got a serious
situation developing back here.


1248
01:03:42,616 --> 01:03:43,716
>> I can't control this.


1249
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:45,376
These are not going to work.


1250
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:46,956
>> Bryan, you got
to do something.


1251
01:03:47,176 --> 01:03:50,636
>> I got it.


1252
01:03:51,026 --> 01:03:52,826
>> Jos, I'm going to need
you to buy some more time.

>> Needless to say, hair
like that doesn't come easy.


1255
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:07,076
So while he's dealing with
his crisis backstage--


1256
01:04:07,296 --> 01:04:09,646
oh look, I've actually got
an audio message from him.


1257
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,856
Now, what's really cool
is I can actually listen


1258
01:04:11,856 --> 01:04:14,856
to audio messages and reply to
them from the lock screen simply


1259
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:16,296
by raising the iPhone to my ear.


1260
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:20,996
>> Hey Jos, we got the
crisis contained back here.


1261
01:04:21,256 --> 01:04:25,356
I'm good to go, so wrap it
up whenever you're ready.


1262
01:04:25,356 --> 01:04:26,966
>> And that's easy to
listen to a message.


1263
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:29,616
I can reply to it the same way.


1264
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:30,916
Craig, it's good to hear


1265
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:33,796
that you survived the
great hair crisis of 2014.


1266
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:34,986
I'll get things wrapped up here


1267

and we'll get the
show back to you.


1268
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:38,906
Lower it and the
message is sent.

>> OK. So next up, iCloud Drive.


1278
01:05:09,346 --> 01:05:12,296
So, of course, iCloud
documents work great


1279
01:05:12,296 --> 01:05:15,936
across a single app
on your iOS devices.


1280
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:20,306
But now, with iCloud Drive,
you also have a great way


1281
01:05:20,306 --> 01:05:22,446
to work across applications.


1282
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:26,986
So say you're in an app here
like Sketchbook, you can bring


1283
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:30,946
up your iCloud Drive panel
and open documents directly


1284
01:05:31,066 --> 01:05:32,366
from other applications


1285
01:05:32,366 --> 01:05:35,056
like a compatible document
inside of GoodReader.


1286
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:38,716
And when you open it up in that
document, in that application


1287
01:05:38,716 --> 01:05:41,756
and edit it, those edits
are saved right back


1288
01:05:41,756 --> 01:05:43,046
to their original locations.


1289
01:05:43,046 --> 01:05:44,446
So you don't end up with all


1290
01:05:44,446 --> 01:05:46,496
of these different
versions and copy problems.


1291
01:05:47,086 --> 01:05:50,666
Now, of course, you also have
access to all of those documents


1292
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,306
on your Mac and on
Windows as well.


1293
01:05:53,796 --> 01:05:55,036
So that's iCloud Drive.


1294
01:05:55,536 --> 01:05:59,046
Next up, something you weren't
expecting from me, Enterprise.


1295
01:05:59,046 --> 01:06:01,686
Now it turns out that iOS--


1296
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:05,386
yeah, they got one Enterprise
guy over there, I know.


1297
01:06:05,386 --> 01:06:07,636
So iOS is a huge hit
in the Enterprise.


1298
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:12,626
In fact, 98 percent of
the Fortune 500 uses iOS.


1299
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:15,186
And we're going to
get the last two.


1300
01:06:15,606 --> 01:06:19,226
And it's in part
because of these great


1301
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,676
iOS-tailored applications.


1302
01:06:22,406 --> 01:06:27,536
But it's also because of the
amazing array of technologies,


1303
01:06:27,536 --> 01:06:29,756
both technologies that
applied to all of us


1304
01:06:29,756 --> 01:06:32,126
in protecting our
privacy and security


1305
01:06:32,366 --> 01:06:34,736
but also Enterprise
manageability features


1306
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:36,636
that we've added to
iOS over the years.


1307
01:06:37,346 --> 01:06:39,976
Now, one of them
that we just released


1308
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:43,926
in the last few months I think
is emblematic of our philosophy


1309
01:06:43,926 --> 01:06:46,916
of the Enterprise, and that's
the Device Enrollment Program.


1310
01:06:47,496 --> 01:06:49,766
Now traditionally, if you
go to work at a company


1311
01:06:49,796 --> 01:06:51,896
and they want you to give you
a device, they actually have


1312
01:06:51,896 --> 01:06:54,836
to take the device they give
you, rip it out of its box,


1313
01:06:55,096 --> 01:06:58,216
connect it to some PC,
image it with software


1314
01:06:58,216 --> 01:06:59,966
to configure, it's a big pain.


1315
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:02,436
But now with the Device
Enrollment Program,


1316
01:07:02,696 --> 01:07:04,756
you can actually get
your iPad or iPhone


1317
01:07:05,096 --> 01:07:06,896
in its original shrink wrap box.


1318
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:11,036
And when you open it up, it'll
automatically configure itself


1319
01:07:11,366 --> 01:07:13,776
for your Enterprise,
setting up all of your mail


1320
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:16,136
and getting your mail
messages, automatically setting


1321
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:19,436
up your calendar, and even
downloading all your Enterprise


1322
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:21,286
apps, it's that simple.


1323
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:26,366
Well now, in iOS 8, we
continue our focus on security,


1324
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,206
productivity and management.


1325
01:07:28,706 --> 01:07:31,106
iOS 8 has expanded
data protection.


1326
01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:32,956
So you get passcode protection


1327
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:35,996
of all the major data types
including third-party apps.


1328
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:38,426
We have a Per-message S/MIME


1329
01:07:38,876 --> 01:07:41,356
and we have a great productivity
feature I think we're all going


1330
01:07:41,356 --> 01:07:43,326
to like called VIP threads.


1331
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:46,796
So now, there's a thread
you're on or message you send,


1332
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:47,786
and you want to get notified


1333
01:07:47,786 --> 01:07:50,216
on the lock screen whenever
there's a reply on that thread,


1334
01:07:50,616 --> 01:07:52,356
you can get that
with just a tap.


1335
01:07:53,046 --> 01:07:57,056
Now we also have Automatic Reply
for Exchange, for Out of Office,


1336
01:07:57,556 --> 01:07:59,716
Free/Busy information
in calendar.


1337
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:04,066
And we support third-party
Enterprise document providers


1338
01:08:04,226 --> 01:08:06,666
in addition to iCloud,
integrated right


1339
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,796
in to iCloud capable
applications.


1340
01:08:09,516 --> 01:08:11,126
Now we also improved
our management--


1341
01:08:11,246 --> 01:08:12,756
yes, the Enterprise
guy back there.


1342

[ Applause ]


1343
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:18,836
So, we also extend
our management


1344
01:08:18,836 --> 01:08:20,586
to include managed
books and PDFs,


1345
01:08:20,586 --> 01:08:24,416
and this is of course especially
valuable for education.

01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:27,166
So those are just a few
features for Enterprise.


1347
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:31,136
Now, something that we all
care a lot about, Health.


1348
01:08:31,626 --> 01:08:32,305
Whoa.


1349
01:08:33,515 --> 01:08:35,876
[ Applause ]


1350
01:08:36,376 --> 01:08:41,606
So, developers have created a
vast array of healthcare devices


1351
01:08:42,376 --> 01:08:44,145
and accompanying applications,


1352
01:08:44,216 --> 01:08:46,826
everything from monitoring
your activity level,


1353
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:49,586
to your heart rate,
to your weight,


1354
01:08:50,216 --> 01:08:52,886
and chronic medical conditions
like high blood pressure


1355
01:08:53,236 --> 01:08:57,145
and diabetes, but up to now
the information gathered


1356
01:08:57,145 --> 01:09:00,066
by those applications
lives in silos.


1357
01:09:00,406 --> 01:09:03,196
You can't get a single
comprehensive picture


1358
01:09:03,645 --> 01:09:04,986
of your health situation.


1359
01:09:05,656 --> 01:09:07,975
But now you can with HealthKit.


1360
01:09:08,886 --> 01:09:11,356
HealthKit provides
a single place


1361
01:09:11,576 --> 01:09:14,685
that applications can contribute
to a composite profile


1362
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:16,656
of your activity and health.


1363
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,776
And HealthKit comes


1364
01:09:18,776 --> 01:09:20,765
with a corresponding
application, Health.


1365
01:09:21,486 --> 01:09:26,496
And with Health, you can
monitor all of your metrics


1366
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:29,136
that you're most
interested in your activity.


1367
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:33,216
But not just that, you can
use third-party applications.


1368
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:35,216
Now we carefully
protect your privacy


1369
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:38,176
so you have total control over
which applications have access


1370
01:09:38,176 --> 01:09:40,746
to which part of your
healthcare information.


1371
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:44,055
But you can for instance provide
different activity, weight,


1372
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:47,376
heart rate information
to the Nike app.


1373
01:09:47,566 --> 01:09:49,645
And Nike is working to
integrate HealthKit,


1374
01:09:49,926 --> 01:09:52,366
so they use that information
to help you in your pursuit


1375
01:09:52,366 --> 01:09:54,296
of your personalized
fitness goals.


1376
01:09:54,976 --> 01:09:57,526
Now, we're also working
with the Mayo Clinic,


1377
01:09:58,016 --> 01:09:59,976
innovators in healthcare.


1378
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:03,326
And with their integration
with HealthKit, they're going


1379
01:10:03,326 --> 01:10:07,916
to be able that when a patient
takes let's say a blood pressure


1380
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:10,956
reading, HealthKit
automatically notifies their app


1381
01:10:11,316 --> 01:10:13,816
and their app is automatically
able to check whether


1382
01:10:13,816 --> 01:10:16,436
that reading is within
that patient's personalized


1383
01:10:16,436 --> 01:10:18,396
healthcare parameters
and thresholds.


1384
01:10:18,706 --> 01:10:21,856
And if not, it can contact
the hospital proactively,


1385
01:10:22,106 --> 01:10:24,886
notify a doctor and that
doctor can reach back


1386
01:10:25,006 --> 01:10:28,656
to that patient providing
more timely care.


1387
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:29,136
Now--


1388

[ Applause ]


1389
01:10:35,806 --> 01:10:39,306
Now we think this is going to be
really important for healthcare


1390
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:41,716
and the CEO of the
Mayo Clinic agrees.


1391
01:10:42,066 --> 01:10:44,516
He says that, "We believe
Apple's HealthKit will


1392
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:47,026
revolutionize the
health industry--


1393
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:48,826
how the health industry
interacts with people.


1394
01:10:49,236 --> 01:10:50,556
We're proud to be
at the forefront


1395
01:10:50,556 --> 01:10:53,356
of this innovative technology
with the Mayo Clinic app."


1396
01:10:54,346 --> 01:10:57,246
We agree. Now we're also
working with leaders


1397
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:59,976
in healthcare applications
like Epic systems.


1398
01:11:00,266 --> 01:11:05,296
Now they provide the technology
that enables hospitals serving


1399
01:11:05,296 --> 01:11:07,206
over 100 million Americans.


1400
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,916
And so now with their
integration with HealthKit,


1401
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:13,566
patients-- these leading
institutions will be able


1402
01:11:13,566 --> 01:11:16,266
to get closer in
sharing their information


1403
01:11:16,556 --> 01:11:19,706
with their doctors
and that is Health.

01:11:28,566 --> 01:11:30,966
Next up, Family Sharing.


1406
01:11:31,716 --> 01:11:34,816
It's the easy way to
share what's important.


1407
01:11:35,806 --> 01:11:37,266
Now when I was a kid,


1408
01:11:38,106 --> 01:11:41,056
the refrigerator was the
center of family sharing.


1409
01:11:41,056 --> 01:11:42,316
Our refrigerator looked just


1410
01:11:42,316 --> 01:11:44,466
like this except the
kid who had gray hair.


1411
01:11:44,866 --> 01:11:50,906
But we've now in iOS made it
that easy to set up your family


1412
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:54,436
on their iOS devices and once
you've set up your family


1413
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:57,356
as a family unit,
you automatically get


1414
01:11:57,506 --> 01:12:01,766
to share photos with the shared
photo stream, to share calendars


1415
01:12:01,846 --> 01:12:04,596
with your family, to
share reminder list


1416
01:12:05,036 --> 01:12:06,656
and automatically
configure things


1417
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,096
like with permission,
Find My Friends.


1418
01:12:09,676 --> 01:12:12,436
And find your kid's devices,
which is something I do


1419
01:12:12,436 --> 01:12:13,616
about every other day.


1420
01:12:14,076 --> 01:12:15,526
It's really handy.


1421
01:12:16,026 --> 01:12:18,286
Now, of course, we're also used


1422
01:12:18,286 --> 01:12:20,576
to in the home sharing
physical media.


1423
01:12:20,576 --> 01:12:24,266
But increasingly, our media
is in the form of songs


1424
01:12:24,266 --> 01:12:29,216
from iTunes, movies,
books, and apps.


1425
01:12:30,076 --> 01:12:31,996
Well now, with Family Sharing,


1426
01:12:32,436 --> 01:12:35,196
you can get it not just your
purchases but the purchase


1427

of your family.

to six family members


1431

who all share the
same credit card.


1432
01:12:55,646 --> 01:12:59,356
And it works great for
kids as well and not just


1433
01:12:59,356 --> 01:13:01,406
because they can make
purchases on your credit card,


1434
01:13:01,406 --> 01:13:04,036
but in fact because when
they do make a purchase,


1435
01:13:04,696 --> 01:13:06,796
they get prompted ask
you for permission.


1436

We all take a lot of photos

and we share them with
whatever device we have handy.

together photos with iCloud


1443

so that every photo you
take are available to you

We're not only preserving the
common organization edits you do


1447
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:57,506
to all of your photos for your
consistent iCloud photo library


1448
01:13:58,626 --> 01:14:02,106
but your device actually
has access to more photos


1449
01:14:02,106 --> 01:14:04,846
in the cloud than it can
physically store locally


1450
01:14:05,216 --> 01:14:08,016
so you can get them
all wherever you are.


1451
01:14:08,976 --> 01:14:12,136
Now of course, if you
have these many photos,


1452
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:17,356
you want great search and
so we now on iOS 8 Photos,


1453
01:14:17,806 --> 01:14:20,636
we give you great search
suggestions for instance


1454
01:14:20,636 --> 01:14:24,256
of locations, photos taken
near where you are right now,


1455
01:14:25,076 --> 01:14:28,726
photos taken a year ago today,
photos taken in your home,


1456
01:14:28,726 --> 01:14:31,046
but we also give you search.


1457
01:14:31,296 --> 01:14:34,576
And so that search lets you
match on things like location,


1458
01:14:35,206 --> 01:14:40,826
time, and also on albums
that you've set up.


1459

Now, we also help you
perfect your photos

01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:46,586
with great new Smart
Editing controls.


1461
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:50,506
So we have special smart
controls for light and color


1462
01:14:50,926 --> 01:14:54,756
and also for things like
auto-straightening and cropping.

of our new Photos app now.

Let's take a look at photos.


1467
01:15:10,956 --> 01:15:14,396
So here I am in my large
cloud photo collection,


1468
01:15:14,746 --> 01:15:18,396
and I have great search here,
so I have all my suggestion


1469
01:15:18,436 --> 01:15:21,586
but I can also start typing
and you notice I get matches


1470
01:15:21,586 --> 01:15:23,466
on location and time period.


1471
01:15:23,856 --> 01:15:26,476
But also an album, so here
I have beach day with Mandy.


1472
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:27,666
And I can tap right in there,


1473
01:15:28,636 --> 01:15:31,256
look through these nice
photos, let's take a look.


1474
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:33,346
Those are some good ones.


1475
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:37,046
Now that's a photo that
I think has potential


1476
01:15:37,796 --> 01:15:40,136
but it's really quite dark
and kind of washed out.


1477
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:42,906
Unfortunately, we have these
great smart editing controls


1478
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:45,716
that I can use to fix it up, so
I'm going to bring up our levels


1479
01:15:45,716 --> 01:15:47,916
and you also have levels
for light and color


1480
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:48,626
down there at the bottom.


1481
01:15:48,746 --> 01:15:49,546
I'm going tap on light,


1482
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:52,776
and I get this great
smart light meter.


1483
01:15:53,176 --> 01:15:56,486
Now I can just drag this across
like this and it lightens


1484
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:58,776
up the photo really nicely,


1485
01:15:58,776 --> 01:16:00,416
so I dial that in
just the way I want.


1486
01:16:00,986 --> 01:16:03,136
But what's happening under
the hood is really amazing.


1487
01:16:04,086 --> 01:16:06,456
You notice that to achieve
the lightning effect,


1488
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,176
it brought brightness
and contrast up, exposure


1489
01:16:10,176 --> 01:16:12,806
and highlights down
and shadows up based


1490
01:16:12,806 --> 01:16:15,366
on detailed image analysis of
what would achieve that effect.


1491
01:16:16,036 --> 01:16:18,266
Now I could go in and
I could manually try


1492
01:16:18,266 --> 01:16:21,046
to tweak those parameters like
have that level of control


1493
01:16:21,266 --> 01:16:23,306
but I don't need to because
it does such a great job


1494
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:27,836
and I also have that control
for color, so I can just drive


1495
01:16:27,836 --> 01:16:31,336
up the color for instance, bring
out the sky and the skin tones


1496
01:16:31,936 --> 01:16:33,826
and I look at the difference
of what we've been able


1497
01:16:33,826 --> 01:16:38,386
to achieve before, after,
it's really awesome.

Now what's really
great is that my edit


1500
01:16:46,896 --> 01:16:49,806
of course immediately went
up to my cloud photo library.


1501
01:16:49,806 --> 01:16:51,406
And so they're available
to all my devices,


1502

So here's my iPad.


1504
01:16:55,926 --> 01:16:58,986
Now I'm going to go on to my
favorites album, and we notice


1505
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:01,746
that right now in favorites,
I don't have that picture


1506
01:17:01,746 --> 01:17:02,956
because I didn't favorite it.


1507
01:17:03,356 --> 01:17:04,656

made those nice edits,


1508
01:17:04,656 --> 01:17:06,396
the picture is looking great,
I think I'll make it one


1509

on my iPhone on a little heart

01:17:15,046 --> 01:17:16,786
so I can go into that
photo right here.


1512
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:21,156
Now we have those same editing
controls tailored for iPad,


1513
01:17:21,746 --> 01:17:24,526
so I'm going to go in to
do a crop and do a kind


1514
01:17:24,526 --> 01:17:29,216
of extreme close up crop
here like this, hit done


1515
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:32,976
and of course these changes
are going to go up live


1516
01:17:33,186 --> 01:17:36,686
to my iPad photo library and
it go right across to my phone.

[ Applause ]


1518
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:44,956
So of course you may be
wondering what about the Mac?


1519
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:49,666
Well good news, we are
working on a new grounds


1520
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:54,326
up photo solution for the Mac
built with iCloud in mind,


1521
01:17:54,326 --> 01:17:57,016
and that's going to be
shipping early next year but I'd


1522
01:17:57,016 --> 01:17:58,516
like to give you
a sneak peek now.


1523
01:17:58,956 --> 01:18:00,496
All right.


1524
01:18:02,776 --> 01:18:06,446
So let's take a look
at photos on the Mac.


1525
01:18:07,546 --> 01:18:13,216
As you see, I get beautiful
buttery scrolling here.


1526
01:18:13,936 --> 01:18:18,156
I have my moments right here,
I can pinch out if I want


1527
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:22,476
from moments to collections
and all the way out to years.


1528
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:28,276
I can scrub through my photos
like this even in year view.


1529
01:18:28,656 --> 01:18:32,166
If I find a photo I like,
just let go and zoom right in.


1530
01:18:32,966 --> 01:18:36,866
You watch as I magnify
this photo, the interplay


1531
01:18:37,216 --> 01:18:39,026
with the title bar,
it's really gorgeous.


1532
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:44,166
I'm going to go ahead and browse
through these a little bit.


1533
01:18:47,116 --> 01:18:49,296
Now here's a photo
that looks really


1534
01:18:49,296 --> 01:18:50,396
like it's got some potential


1535
01:18:50,396 --> 01:18:52,496
but it could use
some brightening up,


1536
01:18:53,086 --> 01:18:55,046
can have the same
kinds of adjustments.


1537
01:18:55,726 --> 01:18:57,946
You notice here at this
light and color meters, well,


1538
01:18:57,946 --> 01:19:00,746
I can just close this control,
so we can watch what happens


1539
01:19:01,026 --> 01:19:03,976
in real time as I make
the lighting adjustment.


1540
01:19:04,426 --> 01:19:06,686
And notice how some of these
are going up and some are going


1541
01:19:06,686 --> 01:19:10,836
down to create this
effect, it's really great.


1542
01:19:10,836 --> 01:19:14,466
I can do the same with color,
let's just boost the color,


1543
01:19:15,586 --> 01:19:20,036
bring out the sky, bring out the
skin tones, and it's that easy,


1544
01:19:21,126 --> 01:19:24,816
the new photos app, to really
create beautiful images.


1545
01:19:25,156 --> 01:19:28,686
And that's a quick preview
of photos coming to Yosemite


1546
01:19:28,686 --> 01:19:31,986
in the future and to
the new photo solution


1547
01:19:31,986 --> 01:19:35,886
with iCloud photo
library coming with iOS 8.

[ Applause ]


1549
01:19:43,956 --> 01:19:46,476
So now on iOS 8, you
get all your photos


1550
01:19:46,476 --> 01:19:50,146
in your organization crush
your iOS devices and soon


1551
01:19:50,296 --> 01:19:54,036
with your Mac and via
the web, Windows as well.


1552
01:19:54,586 --> 01:19:58,116
Now this is all your
photos and also your videos.


1553
01:19:58,386 --> 01:20:00,546
And these are in
their original format


1554
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,496
and their full resolution.


1555
01:20:03,336 --> 01:20:05,276
Now this uses your
iCloud storage,


1556
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:07,716
so your first 5 gigs are free.


1557
01:20:08,056 --> 01:20:10,976
And we have some great new
affordable plans coming,


1558
01:20:10,976 --> 01:20:15,586
where you get 20 gigs for just
99 cents a month and 200 gigs


1559
01:20:15,996 --> 01:20:18,496
for 3.99, so we can all afford


1560
01:20:18,496 --> 01:20:20,986
to get all our photos
safely up in the cloud.


1561
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:22,966
That is photos.

[ Applause ]


1563
01:20:30,676 --> 01:20:34,726
So, a great set of major
features coming to iOS.


1564
01:20:35,016 --> 01:20:38,426
But of course, there's
always a whole lot more


1565
01:20:38,426 --> 01:20:40,016
than I have time
to talk about here.


1566
01:20:40,566 --> 01:20:44,376
I do want to hit on just two
more quickly, and one is Siri.


1567
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:48,736
Now, we have-- if you take
your phone and you plug it


1568
01:20:48,736 --> 01:20:51,656
in for instance in the car,
you can say, "Hey Siri,"


1569
01:20:51,656 --> 01:20:53,946
and start talking to
Siri without having


1570
01:20:53,946 --> 01:20:55,466
to even touch your phone.


1571
01:20:55,906 --> 01:20:58,606
And we have song
recognition with Shazam.


1572
01:20:58,606 --> 01:21:01,426
So now, if you just start up
Siri and there's a song playing


1573
01:21:01,426 --> 01:21:03,476
around you, it will
tell you what it is


1574
01:21:03,476 --> 01:21:06,756
and you can even purchase it
right there from within Siri.


1575
01:21:07,406 --> 01:21:10,176
Siri also now supports
streaming voice recognition.


1576
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:12,536
So as you talk, you can
see what it's recognizing.


1577
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:15,596
It's more responsive than
ever, and we have support


1578
01:21:15,596 --> 01:21:18,206
for 22 new dictation languages.


1579
01:21:19,656 --> 01:21:23,686
Finally, in China we now
have greatly improved maps


1580
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:27,276
with vector based maps and
turn by turn directions.


1581
01:21:27,776 --> 01:21:30,616
We also have support for
lunar calendar which is great


1582
01:21:30,896 --> 01:21:32,436
for holidays and birthdays.


1583
01:21:32,966 --> 01:21:37,336
Improved Chinese predictive
input and improved weather data.


1584
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:41,036

1586
01:21:47,376 --> 01:21:51,226
So that's a look at the
consumer part of iOS 8.


1587
01:21:51,926 --> 01:21:53,526
To tell you the other
half of the story,


1588
01:21:53,526 --> 01:21:54,996
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.


1589

Amazing new features, and if we
ended the keynote now it would


1593
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:09,746
be a giant release.


1594
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,716
But there is a lot more.


1595
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:18,316
The second part of the
story is what iOS 8 provides


1596
01:22:18,386 --> 01:22:19,616
for developers.


1597
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:24,716
And extending your capability to
make even more incredible apps


1598
01:22:24,716 --> 01:22:27,066
and apps you could
not create before.


1599
01:22:28,186 --> 01:22:33,036
Now, all of these apps are
delivered via the App Store.


1600
01:22:34,356 --> 01:22:40,276
The App Store now has over 1.2
million of your apps on it.


1601
01:22:40,276 --> 01:22:42,026
This is a phenomenal number.


1602
01:22:42,636 --> 01:22:47,526
And the marketplace around these
apps is unbelievably vibrant,


1603
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:53,266
300,000,000 people visit
the App Store every week.


1604
01:22:54,566 --> 01:22:59,076
And these people aren't just
browsing, they are downloading.


1605
01:22:59,996 --> 01:23:04,036
They've now downloaded
over 75 billion apps.


1606
01:23:05,036 --> 01:23:06,846
These are mind blowing numbers.


1607
01:23:07,766 --> 01:23:13,066
Now, what we want to do is
make the App Store even better.


1608
01:23:13,776 --> 01:23:16,736
And so, we're rolling out
a number of new features


1609
01:23:16,836 --> 01:23:23,286
on the store, starting with
we're adding an Explore tab


1610
01:23:23,906 --> 01:23:27,726
to help users find the app
they're looking for more.


1611
01:23:27,726 --> 01:23:30,866
So you can browse through
categories and subcategories.


1612
01:23:31,576 --> 01:23:33,716
We're adding top
trending searches


1613
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:35,476
to make search even better.


1614
01:23:35,776 --> 01:23:41,546
It's great to see WWDC
at the top by the way.


1615
01:23:41,546 --> 01:23:45,746
We're making-- finding
your search even better


1616
01:23:45,746 --> 01:23:50,166
by making it faster by adding
a continuous scrolling list.


1617
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:53,506
We're adding related
searches to make it easier


1618
01:23:53,506 --> 01:23:56,056
to find exactly the
app you're looking for.


1619
01:23:56,716 --> 01:23:59,346
And with the new
Editor's Choice logo,


1620
01:23:59,956 --> 01:24:02,226
users can find the best apps.


1621
01:24:03,756 --> 01:24:05,546
Also for the first time,


1622
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:09,606
we're giving the developers the
capability to form app bundles,


1623
01:24:10,346 --> 01:24:12,826

Also, we're introducing
app previews,

01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:37,496

make short videos--

And the users can make
certain it's an app


1633

that they would want.


1634
01:24:50,426 --> 01:24:56,026
We're also introducing for the
first time today a new service,


1635
01:24:56,206 --> 01:24:58,976
a new beta test service
called TestFlight.

Now, there are many more
features at the App Store


1640
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:23,796
and you hear about
them through the week


1641
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:25,206
and in the afternoon sessions


1642
01:25:25,206 --> 01:25:28,766
but we are really investing
a ton in the App Store.


1643
01:25:29,796 --> 01:25:32,006
It is a huge release.


1644
01:25:32,006 --> 01:25:34,466
Everything will be
available in the fall.


1645
01:25:35,866 --> 01:25:38,716
Now, that brings us to the SDK.


1646
01:25:38,806 --> 01:25:41,946
And for those of you
that are not developers,


1647
01:25:41,946 --> 01:25:44,636
the SDK is a Software
Development Kit


1648
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:49,536
that enables developers to
make all of the amazing apps.


1649
01:25:50,176 --> 01:25:53,886
This release is the
biggest release


1650
01:25:55,046 --> 01:25:57,246
since the launch
of the App Store.


1651
01:25:58,296 --> 01:26:01,836
And it will give developers
the capabilities and tools


1652
01:26:02,386 --> 01:26:04,646
to make things that
you haven't dreamed of


1653
01:26:05,236 --> 01:26:07,566
and to push to a
whole new level.


1654
01:26:08,486 --> 01:26:10,486
And to tell you all
about the SDK,

of endurance training

01:26:28,946 --> 01:26:33,996
So, with this year's SDK, the
team has done just an unreal job


1660

with over 4,000 new
developer APIs.

Now, I want to start
with something


1662
01:26:40,356 --> 01:26:42,596
that I think is perhaps
most profound


1663
01:26:43,526 --> 01:26:45,416
and that's Extensibility.


1664
01:26:46,146 --> 01:26:48,596
So with Extensibility,
applications


1665
01:26:48,596 --> 01:26:52,216
from the App Store will be
able to extend the system


1666
01:26:52,446 --> 01:26:54,786
and offer services
to other apps.

01:27:05,866 --> 01:27:08,686
of the reasons we're also
comfortable installing

so many apps from the App
Store are iOS' security model.


1671

Apps are isolated
inside of sandboxes

where they can access their
own data but can't get


1673

at your personal information
or mess with other apps

01:27:21,136 --> 01:27:22,026
without your permission.


1675
01:27:22,806 --> 01:27:25,496
Well, the handle
Extensibility in an iOS way,


1676
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:29,136
we wanted to build on the
same sandboxing model.


1677
01:27:29,576 --> 01:27:33,426
So now extensions live inside
an application's own sandbox


1678
01:27:33,426 --> 01:27:36,846
with access to its own data,
but other applications can reach


1679
01:27:36,846 --> 01:27:40,466
out by way of iOS'
security mechanisms,


1680
01:27:40,816 --> 01:27:41,906
talk to that extension.


1681
01:27:41,946 --> 01:27:44,746
That extension can even
project UI right back


1682
01:27:44,746 --> 01:27:45,876
in to the originating app.


1683
01:27:46,556 --> 01:27:48,346
Now this enables
some great things.


1684
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:50,136
For instance, in addition


1685
01:27:50,136 --> 01:27:52,136
to the systems built-in
sharing options,


1686
01:27:52,606 --> 01:27:56,286
an app like Pinterest can
offer share sheet to Safari.


1687
01:27:57,226 --> 01:28:00,496
And if you look at
actions, for instance,


1688
01:28:00,496 --> 01:28:04,356
an app like Bing could offer
translation right inside


1689
01:28:04,356 --> 01:28:09,666
of Safari accessing the web
pages web content right there.


1690
01:28:10,276 --> 01:28:14,196
Now we're also supporting photo
filters inside the photos,


1691
01:28:14,616 --> 01:28:16,286
and enabling third parties


1692
01:28:16,316 --> 01:28:19,206
to define their own
document providers that work


1693
01:28:19,206 --> 01:28:22,206
within the iCloud
drive-enabled application.


1694
01:28:23,166 --> 01:28:27,936
Finally, we're enabling third
party apps to define widgets


1695
01:28:28,276 --> 01:28:29,856
that can now go in
Notification Center.


1696
01:28:31,516 --> 01:28:36,706
[ Applause ]


1697
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:42,226
I think it feels
like time for a demo.


1698
01:28:42,336 --> 01:28:44,886
So let's start with
photo filters.


1699
01:28:45,836 --> 01:28:47,396
So, we're back here in photos


1700
01:28:47,396 --> 01:28:51,006
and I've got a nice
photo here of a flower.


1701
01:28:51,006 --> 01:28:53,876
And I'm going to go ahead and
edit and you notice an addition


1702
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:55,646
to the options here at
the bottom of the screen,


1703
01:28:56,296 --> 01:28:59,076
we have at the top left
this extensions button.


1704
01:28:59,076 --> 01:29:00,996
I'm going to click
that, tap that rather.


1705
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:04,246
And you notice I have
several extensions available,


1706
01:29:04,246 --> 01:29:06,756
one from VSCO Cam and
one from Waterlogue.


1707
01:29:06,756 --> 01:29:07,976
I'm going to select Waterlogue.


1708
01:29:08,516 --> 01:29:11,566
And now the Waterlogue extension
is able to run right here


1709
01:29:11,566 --> 01:29:15,166
in the context of photos to
manipulate my photo bringing


1710
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:20,786
up their own UI, deliver this
beautiful water color effect


1711
01:29:21,286 --> 01:29:26,166
to my photo, and when I'm
done, it's right back inside


1712
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:27,976
of my photo album,
it's that easy.


1713
01:29:28,516 --> 01:29:33,856
[ Applause ]


1714
01:29:34,356 --> 01:29:36,026
Then next let's take
a look at widgets.


1715
01:29:36,026 --> 01:29:38,956
So I'm going to just pull
down Notification Center.


1716
01:29:39,056 --> 01:29:42,106
I have my existing widgets
here in my Today view.


1717
01:29:42,566 --> 01:29:45,126
Did you notice an addition
to my widget is down here


1718
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:46,976
at the bottom it says
"One New Widget Available"


1719
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:48,956
because I've downloaded
an app recently


1720
01:29:48,956 --> 01:29:51,696
that contains a Notification
Center widget.


1721
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:52,586
So I'm going to tap Edit.


1722
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:54,686
And you notice its SportsCenter.


1723
01:29:54,686 --> 01:29:56,616
So I can tap the plus
next to SportsCenter,


1724
01:29:57,186 --> 01:30:00,146
position it where I want, I'm
on my widgets in my Today view.


1725
01:30:00,926 --> 01:30:03,116
Tap Done, and now
I have information


1726
01:30:03,116 --> 01:30:06,556
on my favorite sports
teams right here inside


1727
01:30:06,556 --> 01:30:07,626
of Notification Center.


1728
01:30:08,306 --> 01:30:11,076
Now this works great
on iPad as well.


1729
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:12,966
Let's take a look at iPad.


1730
01:30:13,996 --> 01:30:16,946
So iPad, I'm going to bring
down Notification Center.


1731
01:30:17,156 --> 01:30:19,886
And you notice I have this
interactive widget from eBay.


1732
01:30:20,646 --> 01:30:25,686
So, I'm bidding on a guitar and
apparently I'm being outbid.


1733
01:30:26,066 --> 01:30:28,376
So I can now write inside of
notification, take advantage


1734
01:30:28,376 --> 01:30:29,626
of the interactivity widgets.


1735
01:30:30,096 --> 01:30:33,376
I can tap and bid
and just like this,


1736
01:30:34,066 --> 01:30:38,556
I can submit a leading bid all
inside of Notification Center.


1737
01:30:39,216 --> 01:30:41,856
Now to wrap it up, I want to
show you extensions in Safari.


1738
01:30:41,946 --> 01:30:43,386
I'm going to bring up Safari.


1739
01:30:44,036 --> 01:30:45,496
Use our great new tab view.


1740
01:30:45,496 --> 01:30:49,106
It's a page I've been looking
at here with some information


1741
01:30:49,106 --> 01:30:52,506
on a beautiful guitar and I'd
like to learn more about it but,


1742
01:30:52,506 --> 01:30:55,966
unfortunately, you notice
the text here is in Japanese


1743
01:30:55,966 --> 01:30:57,626
and I do not read Japanese.


1744
01:30:58,196 --> 01:31:00,766
Fortunately, I have a Bing
translation extension,


1745
01:31:01,126 --> 01:31:05,366
so I can just bring
up my action sheet.


1746
01:31:05,366 --> 01:31:07,836
And you notice down here in
the second row, Bing translate,


1747
01:31:07,836 --> 01:31:10,546
I'm going to tap on
that and Bing is able


1748
01:31:10,546 --> 01:31:13,456
to translate this web
page right in line.


1749
01:31:14,286 --> 01:31:14,936
Look at that.


1750
01:31:15,516 --> 01:31:22,086
[ Applause ]


1751
01:31:22,586 --> 01:31:24,426
Now for our extension's
grand finale,


1752
01:31:24,426 --> 01:31:27,406
let's put that on
my Pinterest board.


1753
01:31:27,406 --> 01:31:29,296
You see Pinterest has
an extension right here.


1754
01:31:29,296 --> 01:31:32,726
I'm going to tap on that and
this is actually able to bring


1755
01:31:32,726 --> 01:31:35,776
up a UI defined by Pinterest
where I can select my board,


1756
01:31:35,776 --> 01:31:37,146
maybe select my guitar's board.


1757
01:31:37,146 --> 01:31:39,366
Now the Pinterest
extension is accessed


1758
01:31:39,366 --> 01:31:41,486
to the underlying
web page, so I can--


1759
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:43,756
let me slide through
the different photos


1760
01:31:43,756 --> 01:31:46,146
on the page till I find
the one I want to share.


1761
01:31:46,486 --> 01:31:47,206
That's it.


1762
01:31:47,446 --> 01:31:49,276
Tap and I pinned it.


1763
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:52,576
And that's a quick look
at extensions in iOS 8.

[ Applause ]


1765
01:32:00,446 --> 01:32:03,806
Now there's one important kind
of extension that I did fail


1766
01:32:03,806 --> 01:32:05,986
to mention and that's
the ability


1767
01:32:05,986 --> 01:32:09,756
to install system-wide
third party keyboards.


1768
01:32:10,516 --> 01:32:15,926
[ Applause ]


1769
01:32:16,426 --> 01:32:18,656
So now if you have special
keyboard you want to use,


1770
01:32:18,656 --> 01:32:20,026
you can install those in iOS.


1771
01:32:20,396 --> 01:32:23,306
And by default, those
of course run inside


1772
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:26,576
of the most restrictive
sandbox with no network access


1773
01:32:26,606 --> 01:32:28,706
because we want to make sure
to protect your privacy.


1774
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:33,086
But if that keyboard requires
or you want to grant it ability,


1775
01:32:33,086 --> 01:32:35,226
it can ask for access
to the network


1776
01:32:35,736 --> 01:32:38,046
to provide extended
functionality.


1777
01:32:38,126 --> 01:32:39,906
We put those controls
in your hands.

1782
01:32:58,046 --> 01:33:02,446
From the moment we
introduced Touch ID,


1783
01:33:02,826 --> 01:33:05,236
developers were excited
about the potential


1784
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:07,406
and there's no question why,


1785
01:33:07,406 --> 01:33:10,716
Touch ID has been
extremely popular

and people authenticating
in their devices.


1787
01:33:12,726 --> 01:33:14,696
If you look at passcode usage


1788
01:33:14,696 --> 01:33:16,976
on iOS before Touch
ID was less than half.


1789
01:33:17,786 --> 01:33:22,756
On iPhone 5s 83 percent,
people love using Touch ID.


1790
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:26,076
And now, third party
apps can take advantage


1791
01:33:26,076 --> 01:33:27,356
of Touch ID as well.

1793
01:33:36,376 --> 01:33:39,176
So Touch ID protects logins
and user data and it works

01:33:39,176 --> 01:33:41,166
by unlocking Keychain items.


1795
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,386
So it identifies successful
fingerprint matches


1796
01:33:44,626 --> 01:33:47,366
but it always keeps the
fingerprint data itself


1797
01:33:47,706 --> 01:33:49,506
completely protected inside


1798
01:33:49,506 --> 01:33:52,656
of the Secure Enclave
in the A7 processor.


1799
01:33:53,006 --> 01:33:55,116
The fingerprint information
is never exposed


1800

to third party apps or the rest
of the system for that matter.


1801
01:33:58,006 --> 01:33:59,276
It's very secure.


1802

That's Touch ID.

Then next, Cameras.


1804
01:34:03,516 --> 01:34:08,226
We're providing Camera APIs
from manual control of exposure,

API with faster performance,

read but also to write

to the photo library and this
is now your cloud photo library

It's really great.

Now, we talked about
the great HealthKit API,


1812

1814
01:34:38,926 --> 01:34:42,286
Now, there are a lot of great
home automation devices coming


1815
01:34:42,286 --> 01:34:44,526
on the market these days and
they have companion apps,


1816
01:34:44,526 --> 01:34:48,816
things like lights and
door locks, webcams,


1817
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:51,406
garage doors, and thermostats.


1818
01:34:52,346 --> 01:34:54,646
But, you know, each of them
have their own application


1819
01:34:55,026 --> 01:34:58,556
and they end up defining
their own network protocol,


1820
01:34:58,966 --> 01:35:00,936
their own security mechanisms.


1821
01:35:01,486 --> 01:35:04,656
Well, we thought we could bring
some rationality to the space.


1822
01:35:05,106 --> 01:35:07,316
We started working
with the leaders


1823
01:35:07,806 --> 01:35:09,786
in home automation devices.


1824
01:35:10,276 --> 01:35:14,776
And we've come up with HomeKit
with a common network protocol


1825
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,416
that has secure pairing
to ensure


1826
01:35:17,416 --> 01:35:20,486
that only your iPhone
can open your garage door


1827

or unlock your door.


1828
01:35:22,606 --> 01:35:25,746
And in addition to being able
to control individual devices


1829
01:35:25,746 --> 01:35:29,496
in your home, with HomeKit you
can group devices and changes


1830
01:35:29,496 --> 01:35:33,126
in the scenes and then with
Siri integration you can say


1831
01:35:33,126 --> 01:35:35,686
something like, "Get ready
for bed," and be assured


1832
01:35:35,686 --> 01:35:38,226
that your garage door is
closed, your door is locked,

01:36:00,646 --> 01:36:02,236
to write two apps in one.


1841
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:05,506
In addition to the writing in
the client side using Xcode


1842
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:06,866
and our frameworks, you have


1843
01:36:06,866 --> 01:36:08,096
to write the server
side of the app.


1844
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:11,806
You have to write server side
app logic, you have to deal


1845
01:36:11,806 --> 01:36:14,646
with authentication, asset
storage, database storage,


1846
01:36:14,646 --> 01:36:17,016
search, even push
notifications and then you got


1847
01:36:17,016 --> 01:36:18,346
to pay somebody to host it all.


1848
01:36:19,276 --> 01:36:23,086
Well, now, with CloudKit,
CloudKit takes


1849
01:36:23,086 --> 01:36:25,756
over the cloud part
and provide you


1850
01:36:25,756 --> 01:36:28,066
with a client side
programming model


1851
01:36:28,356 --> 01:36:32,456
that lets you access iCloud
authentication storage,


1852
01:36:32,566 --> 01:36:34,016
search and more.


1853
01:36:34,516 --> 01:36:36,216
And when it comes to paying,


1854
01:36:36,836 --> 01:36:43,946
CloudKit is effectively
free, with limits.


1855
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:49,606
So, CloudKit scales the
data allocated to your app


1856
01:36:49,606 --> 01:36:52,476
and bandwidth based on the
number of users using your app.


1857
01:36:53,256 --> 01:36:56,916
And this goes all the way up
to granting you free a petabyte


1858
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:59,126
of assets, 10 terabytes
of database


1859
01:36:59,386 --> 01:37:02,416
and all the bandwidth you
can constructively use.


1860
01:37:02,966 --> 01:37:04,736
That is CloudKit.


1861
01:37:05,516 --> 01:37:12,936
[ Applause ]


1862
01:37:13,436 --> 01:37:16,706
Next, I want to move on to
something huge in the area


1863
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:22,346
of 3D graphics, and
it's called Metal, so--


1864
01:37:23,016 --> 01:37:24,886
[ Laughter ]


1865
01:37:24,886 --> 01:37:29,366
As you know, OpenGL is
the standards based way


1866
01:37:29,366 --> 01:37:33,486
for high performance 3D graphics
on iOS, giving you access


1867
01:37:33,486 --> 01:37:36,096
to the power of the
A7 processor.


1868
01:37:37,026 --> 01:37:39,486
But increasingly, if you look at
what goes on in the performance


1869
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:42,436
of the game, in addition to what
the game wants to accomplish,


1870
01:37:42,436 --> 01:37:46,166
OpenGL ends up being a
thick layer of overhead


1871
01:37:46,466 --> 01:37:48,606
between the game
and the hardware.


1872
01:37:49,756 --> 01:37:51,046
Well, now, we have Metal.


1873
01:37:51,396 --> 01:37:53,976
And Metal dramatically reduces


1874
01:37:53,976 --> 01:37:56,636
that overhead giving
the game near bare


1875
01:37:56,636 --> 01:37:59,056
to the metal access
to the power of A7.


1876
01:37:59,956 --> 01:38:04,986
The results are stunning up
to 10x faster draw call rates.


1877
01:38:05,736 --> 01:38:10,646
Now, in addition to these
dramatically reduced overheads,


1878
01:38:11,496 --> 01:38:13,236
you get access not
just to graphics


1879
01:38:13,236 --> 01:38:15,566
but to the compute
power of the GPU,


1880
01:38:16,216 --> 01:38:18,536
and Metal supports
pre-compiled shaders


1881
01:38:18,536 --> 01:38:19,836
and efficient multithreading


1882
01:38:19,946 --> 01:38:22,266
so you can always get the
most out of the processor.


1883
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:26,336
Now, we've been working
with the leading providers


1884
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:29,886
of gaming engines
on mobile platforms


1885
01:38:30,636 --> 01:38:32,856
and what they've been able
to accomplish with Metal


1886
01:38:33,156 --> 01:38:35,756
in just a few weeks
is truly stunning.


1887
01:38:37,176 --> 01:38:39,906
Let's start with EA and the
work they've done taking their


1888
01:38:39,946 --> 01:38:46,806
console level title Plants vs.
Zombies and bringing it to iOS.


1889
01:38:47,496 --> 01:38:51,876
They're able to put over 1.3
million triangles on the screen


1890
01:38:52,206 --> 01:38:55,166
at a time and do depth
of motion, effects,


1891
01:38:55,466 --> 01:38:58,686
depth of field effects that they
could never imagine achieving.


1892
01:38:58,686 --> 01:39:01,916
In fact, they're using their
Frostbyte console engine


1893
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,936
that they thought could never
come to mobile and now it can.


1894
01:39:05,966 --> 01:39:07,246
And let's look at Crytek.


1895
01:39:08,536 --> 01:39:12,626
Crytek was able to bring their
console-level geom cache to iOS


1896
01:39:13,736 --> 01:39:14,646
and they were able to get


1897
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:17,976
up to 4000 draw calls
per frame going here.


1898
01:39:18,556 --> 01:39:20,476
This is up to 10x, the kind


1899
01:39:20,476 --> 01:39:22,486
of performance they
were seeing previously.


1900
01:39:23,726 --> 01:39:28,936
Now, to show you live what
can be done with Metal,


1901
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:32,356
I'd like to bring up the
founder of Epic Games


1902
01:39:32,356 --> 01:39:34,646
to the stage, Tim Sweeney.


1903
01:39:34,726 --> 01:39:36,456
Tim, come on up.


1904
01:39:37,516 --> 01:39:44,196
[ Applause ]


1905
01:39:44,696 --> 01:39:45,356
>> Thank you.


1906
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:48,246
We've had the opportunity
to work with Metal


1907
01:39:48,446 --> 01:39:50,286
and to illustrate some
of the possibilities,


1908
01:39:50,286 --> 01:39:51,996
we created a Zen Garden.


1909
01:39:52,606 --> 01:39:55,786
Now this environment was built


1910
01:39:56,306 --> 01:39:58,276
in Unreal Engine 4
on a high-end Mac.


1911
01:39:58,636 --> 01:40:02,516
And now thanks to Metal, we're
running it on iPad in Realtime


1912
01:40:02,516 --> 01:40:04,226
with full fidelity
and performance.


1913
01:40:05,466 --> 01:40:08,506
Metal's efficiency enable us
an order of magnitude increase


1914
01:40:08,506 --> 01:40:11,456
in detail making it possible
for developers like us


1915
01:40:11,456 --> 01:40:13,596
to create a new generation
of vivid


1916
01:40:13,596 --> 01:40:15,446
and interactive 3D experiences.


1917
01:40:16,146 --> 01:40:18,126
Now Josh Adams is the
programmer who wrote much


1918
01:40:18,126 --> 01:40:19,266
of the code that's running.


1919
01:40:19,496 --> 01:40:21,056
Josh, can you explain
what we're seeing here?


1920
01:40:21,466 --> 01:40:21,896
>> Yeah, sure.


1921
01:40:22,486 --> 01:40:25,146
First of all thanks to Metal
support for precompiled shaders,


1922
01:40:25,576 --> 01:40:27,126
we can have a huge
variety of materials


1923
01:40:27,126 --> 01:40:28,036
without a load time impact.


1924
01:40:28,036 --> 01:40:31,066
And our first stop we'll
check out this cherry tree


1925
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:34,026
where I can drag on the
screen to paint the petals


1926
01:40:34,026 --> 01:40:36,006
on to the tree and they
start falling to the ground.


1927
01:40:36,716 --> 01:40:39,476
There are about 5,000 petals
here being physically simulated


1928
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:41,916
and I can interact with them
by touching on the screen


1929
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:42,876
to blow wind through the area.


1930
01:40:43,066 --> 01:40:48,836
All right, next up we
have a Koi pond filled


1931
01:40:48,836 --> 01:40:49,546
with hundreds of fish.


1932
01:40:50,486 --> 01:40:53,186
Metal has freed up enough
CPU time and we can have each


1933
01:40:53,186 --> 01:40:54,706
of them running their own
artificial intelligence


1934
01:40:55,036 --> 01:40:56,726
which you can see here as
I drag around the water.


1935
01:40:56,856 --> 01:40:59,766
And there's a few more fish
here than a real Koi pond


1936
01:40:59,766 --> 01:41:01,236
but since Metal lets us
do it, we figured why not.


1937
01:41:03,276 --> 01:41:05,046
And of course every Zen garden
needs some sand to rake.


1938
01:41:06,396 --> 01:41:09,386
So I go over here I can
rake any pattern I want


1939
01:41:09,386 --> 01:41:10,116
into the sand here.


1940
01:41:11,146 --> 01:41:13,206
Now artist love that they
can make an effect like this


1941
01:41:13,636 --> 01:41:15,056
without needing a
programmer like me to make


1942
01:41:15,216 --> 01:41:17,546
that one-off effect for
a drop core reduction


1943
01:41:17,546 --> 01:41:18,516
or other optimizations.


1944
01:41:22,796 --> 01:41:25,286
And for our final
moment of Zen walk


1945
01:41:25,286 --> 01:41:25,966
over to this water fountain.


1946
01:41:28,086 --> 01:41:32,086
Now I can tap on it, pour out
some water which then turns


1947
01:41:32,196 --> 01:41:33,346
to a couple hundred butterflies


1948
01:41:34,126 --> 01:41:35,506
but of course not
going to stop there.


1949
01:41:36,566 --> 01:41:38,426
So I can touch the screen
to call more of them to me


1950
01:41:38,556 --> 01:41:39,526
and then guide them
around the area.


1951
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:43,686
So there are about 3,500
individually animated


1952
01:41:43,686 --> 01:41:44,986
and rendered butterfly
meshes here.


1953
01:41:44,986 --> 01:41:47,656
Now I had to keep telling the
artist to turn the numbers up


1954
01:41:47,656 --> 01:41:49,236
and up because they do not think
it was going to be possible.


1955
01:41:50,006 --> 01:41:50,486
Pretty cool huh?


1956
01:41:51,516 --> 01:42:03,416
[ Applause ]


1957
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:04,316
>> Thanks.


1958
01:42:04,836 --> 01:42:07,136
There are thousands of objects
being rendered here and it seem


1959
01:42:07,136 --> 01:42:09,346
that we couldn't have
dreamed of building prior


1960
01:42:09,346 --> 01:42:11,636
to Metal delivering
a tenfold increase


1961
01:42:11,636 --> 01:42:12,756
in rendering efficiency.


1962
01:42:12,756 --> 01:42:16,226
To have this level of
graphics capability on iPhone


1963
01:42:16,226 --> 01:42:18,896
and iPad now is a
stunning breakthrough.


1964
01:42:18,896 --> 01:42:22,906
We're proud to have been a part
of it and of course we'd love


1965
01:42:22,906 --> 01:42:23,886
to share this with you.


1966
01:42:23,976 --> 01:42:26,586
So as soon as iOS 8 is
available we will be making


1967
01:42:26,586 --> 01:42:29,496
that Zen garden available
in the app store for free.


1968
01:42:29,846 --> 01:42:30,326
Thank you.


1969
01:42:31,516 --> 01:42:40,426
[ Applause ]


1970
01:42:40,926 --> 01:42:44,226
>> Its amazing and that was--
it's easy to forget on an iPad.


1971
01:42:45,226 --> 01:42:47,326
Its incredible graphics
they were able to achieve


1972
01:42:47,326 --> 01:42:49,386
and I think we are all
feeling very Zen now.


1973
01:42:49,546 --> 01:42:50,146
So that's very good.


1974
01:42:50,776 --> 01:42:51,626
So that's Metal.


1975
01:42:51,996 --> 01:42:54,626
Now I want to move
from high-end 3D gaming


1976
01:42:55,206 --> 01:42:57,926
to casual gaming in Sprite Kit.


1977
01:42:58,136 --> 01:43:00,476
We introduced Sprite
Kit last year at WWDC.


1978
01:43:00,476 --> 01:43:02,606
And it's been a big hit


1979
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,616
with people building casual
games on the app store.


1980
01:43:06,196 --> 01:43:09,116
And now this year we've
really enhanced Sprite Kit


1981
01:43:09,116 --> 01:43:11,346
with some things that make
your casual games just


1982
01:43:11,346 --> 01:43:12,326
that much more fun.


1983
01:43:12,766 --> 01:43:16,086
We have support for light
sources, field forces,


1984
01:43:16,726 --> 01:43:19,316
per-pixel physics that
actually allow your objects


1985
01:43:19,316 --> 01:43:22,006
to automatically interact
with proper physics based


1986
01:43:22,006 --> 01:43:25,646
on their drawn shapes and
even inverse kinematics.


1987
01:43:26,346 --> 01:43:28,876
And now also this year
for the first time


1988
01:43:28,876 --> 01:43:32,026
on iOS we're bringing SceneKit.


1989
01:43:33,516 --> 01:43:36,526
[ Applause ]


1990
01:43:37,026 --> 01:43:39,446
Now SceneKit is a
3D scene renderer


1991
01:43:39,726 --> 01:43:42,506
and now it's been enhanced
as designed for casual games


1992
01:43:42,506 --> 01:43:45,676
with an integrated physics
engine, particle systems


1993
01:43:45,726 --> 01:43:48,046
and support for scripted
actions.


1994
01:43:48,466 --> 01:43:51,406
So these are two great solutions
for casual games on iOS.


1995
01:43:52,706 --> 01:43:55,186
Next, Xcode--


1996
01:43:56,516 --> 01:43:58,636
[ Applause ]


1997
01:43:59,136 --> 01:44:02,196
Now Xcode is the tool set we use


1998
01:44:02,196 --> 01:44:05,766
to build all applications
for the Mac and iOS.


1999
01:44:06,686 --> 01:44:08,186
And Xcode is in fact one


2000
01:44:08,186 --> 01:44:11,266
of the most popular
pro-apps on our platform.


2001
01:44:11,646 --> 01:44:15,776
The last version was
downloaded 14 million times.


2002
01:44:16,816 --> 01:44:17,776
It's unbelievable.


2003
01:44:18,456 --> 01:44:22,776
Now of course central to
Xcode is the language we use


2004
01:44:22,776 --> 01:44:25,456
to develop our apps,
Objective-C.


2005
01:44:26,486 --> 01:44:30,956
Now Objective-C has served
us so well for 20 years.


2006
01:44:30,956 --> 01:44:32,146
We absolutely love it.


2007
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:35,616
But we had to ask ourselves
the question what would it be


2008
01:44:35,616 --> 01:44:40,536
like if we had Objective-C
without the baggage of C?


2009
01:44:41,516 --> 01:44:43,626
[ Laughter ]


2010
01:44:44,126 --> 01:44:46,466
Well we did more
than think about it.


2011
01:44:47,936 --> 01:44:49,686
We have a new programming
language.


2012
01:44:50,516 --> 01:45:00,356
[ Applause ]


2013
01:45:00,856 --> 01:45:04,406
The language is called Swift
and it totally rules [laughter].


2014
01:45:06,146 --> 01:45:07,656
Swift is fast.


2015
01:45:07,866 --> 01:45:08,766
It is modern.


2016
01:45:09,146 --> 01:45:10,656
It is designed for safety.


2017
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,276
And it enables the level of
interactivity and development


2018
01:45:13,276 --> 01:45:15,136
that you've never
seen on the platform.


2019
01:45:15,926 --> 01:45:19,646
When it comes to
speed, Swift is great.


2020
01:45:19,876 --> 01:45:21,916
Compare Python a popular
scripting language


2021
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:23,806
with Objective-C, when it
comes to something like,


2022
01:45:23,806 --> 01:45:25,406
let's say complex object sort.


2023
01:45:25,676 --> 01:45:27,186
Objective-C is a lot faster.


2024
01:45:28,516 --> 01:45:30,066
But Swift is faster still.


2025
01:45:30,716 --> 01:45:33,836
And take something like
RC4 encryption extremely


2026
01:45:33,836 --> 01:45:36,356
computationally intensive.


2027
01:45:36,846 --> 01:45:39,596
Python gets utterly crushed
in this particular benchmark.


2028
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,156
And Objective-- but
look at Swift.


2029
01:45:44,606 --> 01:45:48,156
Now Swift is also modern
with features like Closures,


2030
01:45:48,156 --> 01:45:49,506
Generics, Type inference,


2031
01:45:49,506 --> 01:45:52,276
Multiple return types,
and Namespaces.


2032
01:45:53,516 --> 01:46:08,566
[ Applause ]


2033
01:46:09,066 --> 01:46:10,416
You know how many
people at home are going,


2034
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:12,946
what the heck are these
guys talking about?


2035
01:46:13,016 --> 01:46:14,786
[ Laughter ]


2036
01:46:14,786 --> 01:46:17,646
With Swift you're able to
reduce a common pattern


2037
01:46:17,646 --> 01:46:19,656
that you might see in your
Objective-C code like this.


2038
01:46:20,406 --> 01:46:23,546
And reduce it to
something as simple as this.


2039
01:46:24,136 --> 01:46:27,676
And Swift defines
away large classes


2040
01:46:27,676 --> 01:46:31,256
of common programming errors
they just aren't possible.


2041
01:46:32,376 --> 01:46:36,606
Now, Swift is completely native
to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.


2042
01:46:36,846 --> 01:46:39,626
It's built with the
same LLVM compiler


2043
01:46:39,626 --> 01:46:43,046
as Objective-C using the same
Optimizer and Autovectorizer.


2044
01:46:43,196 --> 01:46:45,726
And it has the same ARC
memory management model.


2045
01:46:45,926 --> 01:46:48,346
And the same runtime which means


2046
01:46:48,346 --> 01:46:53,036
that your Swift code can fit
right alongside your Objective-C


2047
01:46:53,036 --> 01:46:55,596
and your C code in
the same application.


2048
01:46:56,516 --> 01:47:05,356
[ Applause ]


2049
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:09,556
Now Swift also enables a level
dynamism and interactivity


2050
01:47:09,556 --> 01:47:11,546
in development that
we've never seen before


2051
01:47:11,546 --> 01:47:14,036
for the feature we
call playgrounds.


2052
01:47:14,516 --> 01:47:17,496
To demonstrate Swift and
playgrounds in action,


2053
01:47:17,926 --> 01:47:21,206
I'd like to bring to
the stage Chris Lattner.


2054
01:47:21,466 --> 01:47:22,156
Come on up Chris.


2055
01:47:23,516 --> 01:47:28,866
[ Applause ]


2056
01:47:29,366 --> 01:47:29,996
>> Thank you Craig.


2057
01:47:30,096 --> 01:47:32,846
I am thrilled to be here
and to be the first person


2058
01:47:32,846 --> 01:47:34,536
to give you a taste of Swift.


2059
01:47:35,856 --> 01:47:36,826
Let me show you how fun


2060
01:47:36,826 --> 01:47:39,506
and interactive it is
to write Swift code.


2061
01:47:42,936 --> 01:47:44,696
This is the Swift playground,


2062
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:48,266
as I start typing I get
an immediately response.


2063
01:47:49,726 --> 01:47:52,136
It is actually running
my code as I type it


2064
01:47:52,356 --> 01:47:59,356
and displaying the result
in the sidebar to the right.


2065
01:47:59,356 --> 01:48:01,406
Of course, Swift
user type inference


2066
01:48:01,526 --> 01:48:04,066
and has powerful string
processing capabilities


2067
01:48:04,516 --> 01:48:06,556
which make it as easy to
use as a scripting language


2068
01:48:06,886 --> 01:48:08,926
without sacrificing
any performance.


2069
01:48:10,316 --> 01:48:13,156
Swift was designed from
the ground up for Cocoa


2070
01:48:13,156 --> 01:48:16,506
and Cocoa Touch, so of course
I have their full power


2071
01:48:16,506 --> 01:48:17,616
at my fingertips.


2072
01:48:18,246 --> 01:48:20,866
Now, I can build
anything with Swift


2073
01:48:21,406 --> 01:48:23,856
from a social media
application all the way


2074
01:48:23,856 --> 01:48:26,746
up to a high-performance,
3D game using Metal.


2075
01:48:27,836 --> 01:48:29,306
But today to keep it simple,


2076
01:48:29,456 --> 01:48:32,916
I think I'll write a
simple casual 2D game.


2077
01:48:33,856 --> 01:48:35,556
Let's start by using NSImage.


2078
01:48:37,216 --> 01:48:40,406
Let's start by using
NSImage to load a resource.


2079
01:48:40,976 --> 01:48:44,086
As you can see here, I've--


2080
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:47,426
the playground sees
I've loaded an image,


2081
01:48:47,776 --> 01:48:52,036
I can ever see it right
here from within Xcode.


2082
01:48:52,176 --> 01:48:55,546
Now, Swift is loaded with
high-end features like Generics


2083
01:48:55,546 --> 01:48:59,366
that allow me to get a lot
done with very little code.


2084
01:48:59,566 --> 01:49:01,786
Here you can see I'm
using an array of strings


2085
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:05,446
and using the functional map
algorithm to apply closure


2086
01:49:05,446 --> 01:49:08,766
to every element which allows
me to load an entire list


2087
01:49:08,766 --> 01:49:13,306
of images all with the
simple line of code.


2088
01:49:13,506 --> 01:49:15,936
Now, all these resources of part
of this game that I'm working on


2089
01:49:16,186 --> 01:49:21,106
and one piece I still need to
finish up is the flight path


2090
01:49:21,106 --> 01:49:22,426
for the blimp that we have.


2091
01:49:23,946 --> 01:49:26,926
Now this is a simple loop
that computes the position


2092
01:49:26,926 --> 01:49:29,176
for the blimp overtime
as my game plays.


2093
01:49:30,406 --> 01:49:33,976
And in addition to seeing
individual values Swift


2094
01:49:34,466 --> 01:49:37,516
playgrounds even allow me to
visualize the entire history


2095
01:49:37,516 --> 01:49:40,526
of a value overtime as
my application runs.


2096
01:49:41,046 --> 01:49:42,696
And so now I can immediately see


2097
01:49:42,696 --> 01:49:45,916
that this equation will
cause my blimp to slowly sink


2098
01:49:45,916 --> 01:49:47,176
as the scene plays out.


2099
01:49:48,406 --> 01:49:49,356
But I think I can do better


2100
01:49:49,446 --> 01:49:51,116
and that's not exactly
what I'm looking for.


2101
01:49:51,516 --> 01:49:55,486
So I can change the code and
I get an immediate response.


2102
01:49:56,646 --> 01:49:59,966
Simply by changing the equation
the blimp will now rise and fall


2103
01:49:59,966 --> 01:50:02,016
as the scene plays out
which is a lot more


2104
01:50:02,016 --> 01:50:02,876
of what I'm looking for.


2105
01:50:04,196 --> 01:50:06,386
So, now that we have this the
way we want, we can take this


2106
01:50:06,386 --> 01:50:09,666
and copy it and let's go to
the game that I'm working on.


2107
01:50:10,606 --> 01:50:11,656
It's right here.


2108
01:50:12,806 --> 01:50:14,696
Now, this is a playground
just like before.


2109
01:50:15,286 --> 01:50:18,996
But here, I have a game in the
code written using Sprite Kit.


2110
01:50:19,526 --> 01:50:22,786
Now, you can see our blimp
going left and right,


2111
01:50:22,786 --> 01:50:23,976
straight across the scene.


2112
01:50:24,676 --> 01:50:25,926
And, I can try out
the flight path


2113
01:50:25,926 --> 01:50:28,726
that we just developed
simply by pasting it in


2114
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:31,286
and getting the immediate
feedback I'm looking for.


2115
01:50:31,946 --> 01:50:36,426
Now, the blimp is rising and
falling just like I wanted.


2116
01:50:37,276 --> 01:50:40,736
Because Swift enables
such powerful interactive


2117
01:50:40,736 --> 01:50:43,296
and dynamic programming
experiences,


2118
01:50:43,296 --> 01:50:46,586
it makes it really easy
to try out new things.


2119
01:50:46,906 --> 01:50:48,596
And, just by adding
a few lines of code,


2120
01:50:48,596 --> 01:50:53,736
I can enable Sprite Kit's per
pixel collisions, field forces


2121
01:50:53,736 --> 01:50:57,746
and lighting effects gaining a
much more interesting result.


2122
01:50:58,796 --> 01:51:02,676
Now, Swift Playgrounds even
give you full power over time.


2123
01:51:02,676 --> 01:51:06,376
And, with this timeline at
the bottom of the screen,


2124
01:51:07,136 --> 01:51:09,496
I can go forwards and backwards


2125
01:51:09,736 --> 01:51:11,716
through the execution
of my game.


2126
01:51:12,366 --> 01:51:14,526
So, I can really see
those effects in action.


2127
01:51:15,086 --> 01:51:16,826
You can see the balloons
interacting with each other


2128
01:51:17,206 --> 01:51:19,746
and with the blimp
just like that.


2129
01:51:20,636 --> 01:51:22,976
Playgrounds give me
unprecedented power


2130
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:26,566
to see my app in detail and
give me full control when I want


2131
01:51:26,566 --> 01:51:28,406
to refine and polish
my application.


2132
01:51:29,726 --> 01:51:32,586
But, of course, Swift
works great with Xcode


2133
01:51:32,786 --> 01:51:34,016
and runs great on iOS.


2134
01:51:34,566 --> 01:51:37,666
So, let's now jump and see what
the finished product looks like.


2135
01:51:43,416 --> 01:51:44,466
Here we go.


2136
01:51:45,526 --> 01:51:46,916
And, this is the game
that we just built.


2137
01:51:46,916 --> 01:51:49,146
It looks pretty great.


2138
01:51:49,776 --> 01:51:52,036
Now, as Craig told you earlier,


2139
01:51:52,036 --> 01:51:54,026
we've also brought
Scene Kit to iOS.


2140
01:51:54,936 --> 01:51:56,516
With Scene Kit, it's super easy


2141
01:51:56,516 --> 01:51:58,766
to build a 3D version
of our game.


2142
01:51:58,766 --> 01:52:02,876
And, that's just a quick
taste and quick look at Swift.


2143
01:52:03,636 --> 01:52:05,796
I think you guys are going
to absolutely love it.


2144

[ Applause ]


2145
01:52:07,706 --> 01:52:08,236

>> So, that's Swift.


2148
01:52:18,516 --> 01:52:21,606
It gives you access to all
of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.


2149
01:52:21,606 --> 01:52:24,256
So, you can build everything
from a simple example,


2150
01:52:24,256 --> 01:52:25,686
like you saw there with Chris,


2151
01:52:25,686 --> 01:52:29,056
to the most powerful
applications you can imagine.


2152
01:52:29,326 --> 01:52:32,456
And Swift is going to be ready
for primetime out of the gates.


2153
01:52:32,696 --> 01:52:36,046
It comes with complete
Xcode support with indexing,


2154
01:52:36,396 --> 01:52:38,276
code completion and debugging.


2155
01:52:38,596 --> 01:52:42,186
And, there's a Swift language
guide available to you now


2156
01:52:42,396 --> 01:52:45,956
in iBooks along with complete
reference documentation.


2157
01:52:46,506 --> 01:52:50,966
And, when iOS and OS X
are available, day one,


2158
01:52:51,056 --> 01:52:54,396
you can submit apps written
in Swift to the App Store.


2159
01:52:55,146 --> 01:52:56,726
That is Swift.

[ Applause ]


2161
01:53:06,536 --> 01:53:07,926
So, as you've been able to see,


2162
01:53:08,176 --> 01:53:10,906
iOS 8 is a huge developer
release


2163
01:53:11,476 --> 01:53:14,066
and a great end user
release with features


2164
01:53:14,406 --> 01:53:20,066
like the new QuickType keyboard,
Tap to Talk in Messages, Health,


2165
01:53:21,546 --> 01:53:24,126
family sharing and
great new photos


2166
01:53:24,646 --> 01:53:26,406
with iCloud photo library.


2167
01:53:26,736 --> 01:53:30,246
But, it's also an
unprecedented developer release


2168
01:53:30,246 --> 01:53:34,696
with technology like
extensions, Metal and Swift.


2169
01:53:36,096 --> 01:53:37,546
That's iOS 8.


2170
01:53:37,806 --> 01:53:41,976
It's going to be available to

2172
01:53:50,286 --> 01:53:53,676
And, you guessed it, available
to everyone else in the fall


2173
01:53:54,606 --> 01:53:56,996
and it will run on
all of these devices.


2174
01:53:57,476 --> 01:53:58,546
That is iOS 8.


2175
01:53:58,546 --> 01:53:59,646
Thank you.

2177
01:54:04,076 --> 01:54:04,586
>> Great job.

2179
01:54:11,546 --> 01:54:13,776
It's an incredible
set of features


2180
01:54:13,886 --> 01:54:15,446
and an incredible release.


2181
01:54:16,046 --> 01:54:17,166
It's been a fun morning.


2182
01:54:17,166 --> 01:54:18,356
You can probably
see that from us.


2183
01:54:18,356 --> 01:54:19,976
I hope you've enjoyed
it as well.

2185
01:54:22,266 --> 01:54:22,736
Thank you.


2186
01:54:24,916 --> 01:54:30,456
This morning, you've seen
Yosemite, the future of OS X


2187
01:54:30,456 --> 01:54:35,036
with an incredible new
design, amazing new features


2188
01:54:35,606 --> 01:54:38,366
and engineered to work
seamlessly with iOS.


2189
01:54:39,496 --> 01:54:44,016
You've seen iOS 8, the
biggest release of iOS


2190
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:47,086
since the introduction
of the App Store.


2191
01:54:47,486 --> 01:54:52,146
It's huge for developers and
massive for everyone else.


2192
01:54:52,736 --> 01:54:54,976
And perhaps, more importantly,


2193
01:54:55,586 --> 01:55:00,256
you've seen how our
operating systems, devices


2194
01:55:00,256 --> 01:55:03,936
and services all work
together in harmony.


2195
01:55:04,546 --> 01:55:08,656
Together, they provide
an integrated


2196
01:55:08,656 --> 01:55:13,966
and continuous experience
across all of our products.


2197
01:55:15,356 --> 01:55:19,796
And, you've seen how developers
can extend their experience


2198
01:55:19,966 --> 01:55:21,956
further than they've
ever done before


2199
01:55:23,026 --> 01:55:27,666
and how they can create powerful
apps even faster and more easily


2200
01:55:28,266 --> 01:55:30,396
than they've ever been able to.


2201
01:55:33,246 --> 01:55:41,506
Apple engineers platforms,
devices and services together,


2202
01:55:42,156 --> 01:55:47,716
we do this so we can
create a seamless experience


2203
01:55:47,756 --> 01:55:53,686
for our users that is
unparalleled in the industry.


2204
01:55:55,016 --> 01:55:59,996
This is something
only Apple can do.


2205
01:56:00,596 --> 01:56:04,586
You've seen a few people
on stage this morning


2206
01:56:06,206 --> 01:56:12,116
but there are thousands of
people that made today possible.


2207
01:56:12,696 --> 01:56:15,406
And I'd like to take a
moment before we depart


2208
01:56:15,506 --> 01:56:16,856
and recognize them.


2209
01:56:17,116 --> 01:56:21,266
Would everyone from Apple stand
up that had something to do


2210
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:23,826
with bringing today--
making today possible?


2211
01:56:24,596 --> 01:56:25,976
Stand up, don't be bashful.

2213
01:56:43,976 --> 01:56:44,476
Thank you.


2214
01:56:46,296 --> 01:56:50,326
And, there's thousands more back
in Cupertino who were watching


2215
01:56:50,326 --> 01:56:54,246
and I want to thank them, too,
and from all over the world.


2216
01:56:55,336 --> 01:57:00,086
It's a privilege of a lifetime
for me to work with all


2217
01:57:00,086 --> 01:57:01,356
of these incredible people.


2218
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:05,466
I hope everyone has
a huge conference.


2219
01:57:05,666 --> 01:57:06,716
Enjoy the week.


2220
01:57:06,716 --> 01:57:07,776
Thank you very much.
