2
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:24,996
>> I have a hunch that most of


3
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:26,186
you probably found yourself in


4
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:27,156
this situation before.


5
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:30,356
A long list of names, a lot of


6
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:33,666
scrolling, many doubts, until


7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,686
you have to embrace the fact


8
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:35,386
that you don't know what you're


9
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:36,576
doing, so you just wing it.


10
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:39,116
But is there a better way to


11
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:39,636
pick fonts?


12
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:41,476
Yes, there is.


13
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:43,866
You're probably familiar with a


14
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,806
San Francisco font, the system


15
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:45,986
font.


16
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:48,896
It's minimal, functional, and it


17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,496
provides great visual continuity


18
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:52,076
between the system and your app.


19
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:53,716
But sometimes, you need


20
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:54,436
something different.


21
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,026
Perhaps you want your app to


22
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:58,096
exude sophistication?


23
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,266
Or feel literary?


24
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:02,506
Be awkward?


25
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,346
Or just loud and upfront?


26
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:09,776
How do you figure out which type


27
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,056
facing style is the right one


28
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:11,436
for your app?


29
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:13,476
Well, you need to answer at


30
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:14,446
least two questions.


31
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:17,586
What is my intended use?


32
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:19,406
And this will touch on the


33
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:21,156
functional aspects, "What


34
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:22,346
impression do I want to make?"


35
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,026
This requires to look into how


36
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:25,446
style affects the visual mood of


37
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,106
an app.


38
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,576
Once these questions have


39
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:29,126
answers, you can stop thinking


40
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:30,156
about the pairing of fonts.


41
00:01:31,506 --> 00:01:33,276
But first, I'd like to introduce


42
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:34,836
two terms in the context of


43
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,676
typography: Structure and


44
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:37,076
contrast.


45
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:40,406
To better understand typography,


46
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,296
it is usually helpful to look


47
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:43,106
into calligraphy.


48
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,656
Calligraphy is the art of


49
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,136
writing, and to write, you need


50
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:46,356
a tool.


51
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:48,616
For instance, here are three


52
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:50,586
commonly used tools around the


53
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:51,056
world.


54
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:53,776
On the left, we have the brush,


55
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,616
which is essential to most East


56
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,606
Asian calligraphy and


57
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:57,156
typography.


58
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,526
In the middle, we have the


59
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:00,826
Rodney pen or Kalamos.


60
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:02,946
It has defined Roman letter


61
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,986
forms, the Arabic Naskh style,


62
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:06,556
or many index scripts.


63
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:09,545
And on the right, we have the


64
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,196
pointed pen, the tool that gives


65
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:12,606
precise control of a stroke


66
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:14,276
modulation, a feature that


67
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,086
really shines with some Cyrillic


68
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,056
glyphs, for instance.


69
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,876
But whatever the effect a


70
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,876
calligraphic tool has, it can


71
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,356
always be described in terms of


72
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,556
structure and contrast.


73
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:28,746
And here's structure.


74
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,886
You can think of it as the path


75
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:32,176
a tool follows to achieve a


76
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:32,956
particular shape.


77
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:34,526
Those of us who like to be


78
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,126
fancy, also use the Latin word


79
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:37,586
ductus to refer to structure.


80
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,996
Now, to demonstrate contrast,


81
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:42,366
let me use a personal favorite


82
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,426
among the tools I just showed,


83
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:44,056
the pointed pen.


84
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,116
If I drag it across the screen,


85
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:48,386
I get a very simple line.


86
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:50,976
Now, if I do the same but this


87
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,716
time, pressing as I drag it, I


88
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:53,596
introduce weight.


89
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,676
And this modulation of the


90
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,846
stroke is what we call


91
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,356
"contrast."


92
00:02:58,516 --> 00:02:59,596
So, let's now apply this to


93
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,206
letter forms.


94
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,986
Here are two structures for


95
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:04,816
lowercase N, or two ducti for


96
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:05,506
fancy people.


97
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,516
The one on the left, can be


98
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:10,316
traced with a single stroke.


99
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:11,566
This kind of structure is called


100
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:13,076
cursive, and is inherently


101
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:13,446
dynamic.


102
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:16,506
The one on the right, requires


103
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:18,266
several constructed pen strokes,


104
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,856
and therefore feels more static.


105
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:24,456
These monolinear designs have no


106
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:25,476
contrast right now.


107
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:26,516
So, let me add some.


108
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,636
As we add weight to the vertical


109
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:30,946
strokes, the difference between


110
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:33,196
thick and thin increases, until


111
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:34,536
we reach high contrast.


112
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,196
If I now add weight to the thin


113
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,156
strokes, we move toward low


114
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:40,726
contrast.


115
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:42,346
Now the main difference with our


116
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:44,046
starting point is mostly weight.


117
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,326
So, you may be thinking now,


118
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,316
"Well, this is all fine and


119
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:49,596
dandy, but why do I need to care


120
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,126
about this?"


121
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:52,546
So, let's have a look at those


122
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:53,496
two sentences.


123
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:55,316
At this particular size, the


124
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,636
bottom line is much easier to


125
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,346
read than the top line.


126
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,256
And we can easily understand why


127
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,466
if we look closer at each


128
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:01,826
design.


129
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,366
On top, we have Big Caslon.


130
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:07,586
And below, Adobe Caslon prompt.


131
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:11,136
Both designs are revivals of the


132
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,456
work of British type founder


133
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:14,466
William Caslon, but one is


134
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,816
designed for this play, and the


135
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:16,776
other one for text.


136
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:18,946
Now what does this mean,


137
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:19,426
exactly?


138
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:25,836
The thin strokes in Big Caslon,


139
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:28,386
produce high contrast, which is


140
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:29,616
an appealing graphical feature.


141
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,256
It looks sharp.


142
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:32,966
But if you scale it down, the


143
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:34,196
thin strokes will eventually


144
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:35,516
disappear and will make reading


145
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:36,546
quite unpleasant, if not


146
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:37,126
impossible.


147
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:40,416
On the other hand, Adobe Caslon


148
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:42,296
Pro has lower contrast and can


149
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,686
be used as smaller point sizes,


150
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:45,016
because of its sturdier design.


151
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:47,166
And now the key difference


152
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,656
between those two designs is


153
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,126
spacing.


154
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,696
For optical reasons, reading


155
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:53,476
stays comfortable if the space


156
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,566
between letters increases as the


157
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:56,846
point size decreases.


158
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,816
Adobe Caslon Pro has looser


159
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,516
spacing and this contributes to


160
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,076
a nicer reading experience at


161
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:03,666
smaller size.


162
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,506
Display and text are really just


163
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,206
loose terms describing usage.


164
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:11,766
This play type is meant to draw


165
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:12,276
attention.


166
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:14,346
So, you typically use it at


167
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:15,726
bigger point sizes, which in


168
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,586
turn allows you to use styles


169
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:20,176
with more high -- with higher


170
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,656
contrast and more elaborate


171
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:22,006
details.


172
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,756
Text type is about making the


173
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,386
reading experience comfortable.


174
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:29,096
When picking a text font, you'll


175
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,486
want to make sure the contrast


176
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:32,246
of the type face is such that it


177
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:33,506
will scale down nicely.


178
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,406
The spacing should also feel


179
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:36,586
comfortable at small size.


180
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,946
And in general, try avoiding


181
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:40,476
extremes of weight or style.


182
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,006
A good reading experience is


183
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:42,786
usually the one you don't


184
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:43,176
notice.


185
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:46,246
For display, you have more


186
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:46,646
freedom.


187
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:48,406
This is the right place to use


188
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,936
the more extreme weights or


189
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:50,766
decorative styles.


190
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:52,916
Even in display though, stay


191
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,006
aware of spacing.


192
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:55,956
A headline usually looks better


193
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:56,816
if it's tightly spaced.


194
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,686
Alright, now let's talk about


195
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:01,486
what everyone is really


196
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,776
interested in, style.


197
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:04,886
Becoming better at selecting


198
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:06,426
fonts as with most things,


199
00:06:06,426 --> 00:06:07,296
requires practice.


200
00:06:07,706 --> 00:06:08,896
There's a lot of stuff to learn


201
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,016
and it's perfectly normal to


202
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,036
feel overwhelmed at first.


203
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:13,336
But there's really only one way


204
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:13,846
forward.


205
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:15,356
You need to learn how style


206
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,356
produces an impression.


207
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,236
Remember that app I called


208
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,706
sophisticated in my intro?


209
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,706
Well, I picked that term but


210
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,126
it's by no means a universal


211
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:24,846
qualification.


212
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,216
What style conveys is strongly


213
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:29,756
tied to subjectivity, and will


214
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,166
vary from one person to another.


215
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:33,076
There is one thing you can learn


216
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:34,686
about though, and that is what


217
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,476
people come to associate with a


218
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:37,076
given style.


219
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,546
In other words, their


220
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:39,356
expectations.


221
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,306
So, let's look at the type face


222
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,346
used for the name of the app,


223
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:42,806
Cochin.


224
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,476
The style itself is called


225
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:46,796
transitional old style.


226
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:48,596
Most of you probably never heard


227
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,096
of it, but you've likely been


228
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:51,626
exposed to it in books and/or


229
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:52,166
magazines.


230
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,066
Cochin has very small, lowercase


231
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,116
letters compared to the upper


232
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:56,556
case.


233
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:58,246
This gives a classic appearance,


234
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:00,476
which will feel elegant to a lot


235
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:00,946
of people.


236
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,046
But these proportions also


237
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,616
happen to be exaggerated, and


238
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,466
that makes it feel a bit


239
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:05,986
whimsical.


240
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,096
The companion to Cochin, Snell


241
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,616
Roundhand, is a design mimicking


242
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:11,116
calligraphy.


243
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:13,016
And you don't have to be a


244
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,256
calligrapher to get a sense of


245
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:15,686
how much skill this calligraphic


246
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,406
style demands.


247
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,456
It's elaborate structure and


248
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:19,766
high contrast, lends some


249
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,966
preciousness to this design.


250
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,106
So, if I round them up, I have


251
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:26,146
elegant, whimsical, elaborate,


252
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:26,826
and precious.


253
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,306
How's that for sophistication?


254
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:32,076
So, why now would this feel


255
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:32,756
literary?


256
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:35,016
The two typefaces we're looking


257
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:36,446
at right now, although there is


258
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:38,336
a display, and a textile, both


259
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:39,646
have typical features of a


260
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:40,706
classical book face.


261
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,406
That's why we feel inclined to


262
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:44,826
look at this choice as literary.


263
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,916
But that kind of association is


264
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,546
not natural at all.


265
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:50,696
It just comes from the fact that


266
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,266
most of us have been exposed to


267
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,496
those styles in books.


268
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:56,276
To complete this brief study in


269
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:57,926
style, I'd like to look at the


270
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,196
fame and crazed geometric


271
00:07:59,196 --> 00:07:59,846
sans-serif.


272
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:01,946
This is a great example of how


273
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:03,456
the feel of a typographic style


274
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:05,346
comes both from form and usage.


275
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:07,326
The first appeal of that style


276
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:08,856
is probably -- it's very simple,


277
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,686
geometry, and I'll venture into


278
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,126
saying that we've seen renewed


279
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:13,546
interest recently in that style


280
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,966
because of our current design


281
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,316
infatuation with simplicity.


282
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:19,696
But because this style is all


283
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:20,746
over the place right now, you


284
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:21,976
may be inclined to think that it


285
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,186
feels very contemporary and


286
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:23,656
fresh.


287
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:25,976
But the nerd in me disagrees.


288
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:28,676
This style is almost 100 years


289
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:28,986
old.


290
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,316
And don't get me wrong, I love


291
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:32,236
old stuff, but I just won't call


292
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:32,806
it fresh.


293
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,296
But that's the beauty of style.


294
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:37,275
It has many layers, and new


295
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,326
layers of meaning get added


296
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,056
constantly.


297
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,196
To become better at picking font


298
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:42,866
styles, you need to become aware


299
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,556
of those layers, old and new.


300
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:49,546
So, with our growing knowledge


301
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:51,096
of typographic style, let's look


302
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,356
at a few strategies to pair


303
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:52,716
fonts.


304
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,816
Note the use of the verb "pair"


305
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:55,086
here.


306
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:56,746
There is no rule against using


307
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,416
more than two typefaces, but


308
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,356
trust me, you're better off


309
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:00,106
starting small.


310
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,166
You can always add style later


311
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,286
on if you really need them.


312
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:05,966
The first point I'd like to make


313
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:07,416
here, is about the impact of


314
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:09,016
proportions when pairing fonts.


315
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:12,426
Let's imagine for a moment, you


316
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,946
have to design an app for WWSC,


317
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:16,526
the Worldwide Sign Painters


318
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:17,016
Conference.


319
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,316
You start off nice and easy with


320
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:21,186
this system font, but we're


321
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,666
missing that sign paintery-vibe.


322
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,836
So, we go back to the font menu


323
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,876
and I kid you not, there's a


324
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,236
sign painter typeface in there.


325
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:30,496
Sounds like a perfect match,


326
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:30,736
right?


327
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:35,526
Well, I should mention that us


328
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,816
type nerds have a term for that


329
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:37,376
situation.


330
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:40,976
When someone picks a typeface by


331
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,006
its name, we call that an LTypI,


332
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,656
or Lack of Typographic


333
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:45,286
Imagination.


334
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:48,276
There's nothing wrong with it,


335
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:49,666
but picking feature out just


336
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,586
because your app is about the


337
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:51,856
future might be too much of a


338
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:52,346
shortcut.


339
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,446
So, if you're going to pick it,


340
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,246
make sure it's because the style


341
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:57,906
is appropriate and it serves its


342
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:59,536
functional purpose.


343
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,976
At the end of the day, a


344
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:01,746
[inaudible] should really just


345
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:02,986
be the cherry on top of the


346
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:03,246
cake.


347
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:06,126
So, back to this cherry, I'll


348
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:07,116
risk offending a few of my


349
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:07,616
peers.


350
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,286
You start working on a schedule


351
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:12,946
for the event, and you decide to


352
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,076
use both fonts for typographic


353
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:16,756
contrast, SF and sign painter.


354
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,106
But something's off.


355
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,696
The title's look smaller.


356
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:22,896
And to make them look matched,


357
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,216
we'll have to increase the point


358
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:25,546
size on that sign painter style.


359
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:27,716
Now, where does this difference


360
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:28,136
come from?


361
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,556
Type designers draw glyphs


362
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:32,776
within the bounds of a virtual


363
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:34,416
box called a font body.


364
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,706
Inside this box, proportion will


365
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,106
vary from one design to another.


366
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,646
The height of a font's body is


367
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:42,856
what is referred to as the point


368
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:43,106
size.


369
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,526
So, at the same point size, two


370
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:46,516
fonts can appear to have


371
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,096
different scales because of


372
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:48,506
their design.


373
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:51,036
Let me show you how this could


374
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:51,676
be relevant.


375
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:54,736
Let's say you're working on a


376
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:55,356
dictionary app.


377
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,426
Dictionaries require a lot of


378
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,256
typographic hierarchy, and using


379
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,296
only the weights and italics of


380
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:01,836
a [inaudible] might not be


381
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:02,116
enough.


382
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:03,826
You have those descriptives


383
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:04,856
stand out, for instance.


384
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:07,306
So, we decide to go look for a


385
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:08,546
serif typeface to create


386
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:09,586
typographic contrast.


387
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:11,686
And to try and avoid to tweak


388
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:12,936
point sizes left and right,


389
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:14,396
let's find a serif typeface that


390
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,736
has close proportions to the


391
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:17,346
[inaudible].


392
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:18,836
This is easily done by setting


393
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:20,116
all candidates side by side.


394
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:21,426
They're the same point size and


395
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:22,806
evaluating their apparent scale.


396
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:24,776
There is nothing wrong with


397
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,546
picking a typeface of smaller or


398
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:28,406
greater scale, but just bear in


399
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:29,436
mind that you'll have to adjust


400
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,116
point size if you go with that


401
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:31,436
twice.


402
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,166
So, let's make our life easier


403
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,326
here and look for the closest


404
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:34,936
match available.


405
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:36,316
And we have a winner.


406
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,166
Now, bringing that back in our


407
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,096
layout, we introduce typographic


408
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:43,536
contrast, and we're done.


409
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:45,196
No need to tweak point sizes.


410
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:46,886
If you're worried that this


411
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:47,786
approach might limit your


412
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:49,426
stylistic options, please don't.


413
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,056
There are thousands of good


414
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,506
typefaces out there, and quite a


415
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:53,806
few type designers release from


416
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:55,486
families, with multiple styles


417
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:56,966
of consistent proportions.


418
00:11:59,526 --> 00:12:00,946
So, let's now experiment a bit


419
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,806
with pairing text and display


420
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,176
styles.


421
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:05,456
So, let's start nice and easy


422
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:06,836
again with a [inaudible] in a


423
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:07,856
news story layout.


424
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,896
This typographic layout has


425
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,516
strong stylistic continuity.


426
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,106
The only difference between text


427
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:14,846
and headline, are size and the


428
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:15,616
use of italics.


429
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:17,896
But we might be after something


430
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:18,956
with a bit more of a punch.


431
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,626
And the first way to get there,


432
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,066
the easiest way to get there, is


433
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,006
to first leverage weight.


434
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:26,586
Sticking to a single typeface


435
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:27,896
and pairing some of its variant,


436
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:29,306
is a very efficient way to


437
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:30,536
achieve design consistency.


438
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,196
But since we're here to


439
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:33,796
experiment, let's keep on trying


440
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:34,076
things.


441
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,376
We now change the kind of


442
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:40,116
typographic contrast from a


443
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,766
weight difference to a stylistic


444
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,336
difference.


445
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,616
When doing these kind of


446
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:45,056
pairings, make sure that the


447
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:46,576
stylistic difference is strong


448
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,836
enough to be obvious.


449
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,516
Here we have two typestyles of


450
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,166
both different structures, and


451
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,056
stroke contrast, so we're in a


452
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:54,516
good place.


453
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,986
By the way, it is sometimes good


454
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,826
enough to have a strong display


455
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:03,596
typeface and using the system


456
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:04,596
font at the same time.


457
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:06,366
You're defining your own style,


458
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,136
but also taking advantage of


459
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:09,176
[inaudible] performance as a


460
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,356
typographic workhorse.


461
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:13,916
But let's keep on experimenting


462
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:14,336
anyway.


463
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:15,736
I think I'd like to use a serif


464
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:17,876
typeface down there.


465
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:20,426
We return to an understated and


466
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:21,856
calm effect like we had in the


467
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,206
beginning, but with a quite


468
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:23,856
different flavor.


469
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,246
This will now feel more bookish


470
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,546
because of the type choice, but


471
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:28,776
also because of the subdued


472
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,486
relationship between display and


473
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:30,746
text.


474
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,016
Books tend to go from


475
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:34,186
[inaudible] typographic contrast


476
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,436
because they're about long


477
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:36,886
reading, and of grabbing your


478
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:37,596
attention all the time.


479
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,096
On the other hand, a news layout


480
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:41,776
may be more [inaudible] this.


481
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:44,236
Here we're using san serif for


482
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,006
both display and textiles, but


483
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:47,486
their structuring weights are so


484
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:49,096
different that we still maintain


485
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:50,616
clear and strong typographic


486
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:51,006
contrast.


487
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,066
The display style grabbed your


488
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,566
attention, provides context,


489
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:55,816
this is what you're about to


490
00:13:55,816 --> 00:13:57,696
read, and makes the layout look


491
00:13:57,696 --> 00:13:59,696
appealing and then the textile


492
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,166
will let you read the content


493
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,226
with ease and without


494
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:02,726
disruption.


495
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:05,976
So, as you've now seen, there's


496
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,466
obviously a lot you can do in


497
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:08,486
terms of style pairing.


498
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,666
And I've only given you a


499
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,006
glimpse of the possibilities of


500
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:11,296
course.


501
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,486
The key element is typographic


502
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:13,986
contrast.


503
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:15,476
Whether I did it through size,


504
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:16,876
weight, or style.


505
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:18,966
Finally, if you want to become


506
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,356
better at picking fonts, there


507
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:21,806
is really no way around learning


508
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,246
more about typographic styles,


509
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:24,766
their histories, and evolving


510
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:25,096
trends.


511
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,236
This is how you'll become more


512
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:28,506
confident in front of that font


513
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:28,846
menu.


514
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:30,726
And don't worry, you won't


515
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:31,896
become typographic rock stars


516
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:32,426
overnight.


517
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:34,306
And yes, that's a thing.


518
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:36,616
But at least you know where to


519
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:37,066
start.


520
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,446
And I have no doubt that you'll


521
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:39,636
soon grow into tremendous


522
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,786
typographers yourself.


523
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,266
Thank you.
