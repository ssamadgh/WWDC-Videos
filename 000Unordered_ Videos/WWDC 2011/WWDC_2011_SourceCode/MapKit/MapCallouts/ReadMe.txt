MapCallouts

===========================================================================
ABSTRACT

Demonstrates the use of the MapKit framework, displaying a map view with custom MKAnnotations each with custom callouts.  An annotation object on a map is any object that conforms to the MKAnnotation protocol and is displayed on the screen as a MKAnnotationView.  Through the use of the MKAnnotation protocol and MKAnnotationView, this application shows how you can extend annotations with custom strings and left/right calloutAccessoryViews.

===========================================================================
DISCUSSION

This sample implements two different variations of MKPinAnnotationViews each with their own specific information.  One shows how to use a rightCalloutAccessoryView with a UIButtonTypeDetailDisclosure button and other with leftCalloutAccessoryView containing an image.

Important:
The MapKit framework uses Google services to provide map data. Use of this class and the associated interfaces binds you to the Google Maps/Google Earth API terms of service. You can find these terms of service mentioned in the header section of "MKMapView.h".
