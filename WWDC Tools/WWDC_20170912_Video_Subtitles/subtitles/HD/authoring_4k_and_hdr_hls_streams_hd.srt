1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,770
With the introduction of
the revolutionary iPhone X


2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,572
and AppleTV 4K,


3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,542
the video playback experience
is taken to a whole new level


4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,576
with the addition for support


5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,846
for high dynamic range
and 4K video.


6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:19,386
4K typically refers to
frame sizes up to 3840 by 2160,


7
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,188
offering an exceptionally
detailed


8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,291
and high resolution image
when compared to HD.


9
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:31,198
Wide color is supported across
iOS, macOS, and tvOS,


10
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,835
and the media frameworks support
up to the rec 2020 color space,


11
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:38,205
which covers about 75 percent of
the visible spectrum.


12
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,441
The addition of support for HEVC


13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,977
enables the delivery of
higher quality video


14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:48,615
at about a 40 percent lower
bit rate compared to H.264.


15
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,752
HDR video must be
delivered using HEVC.


16
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,957
There are two HDR formats
that we support:


17
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,126
Dolby Vision and HDR10.


18
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,263
HDR10 utilizes static metadata


19
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,800
that is applied to
the entire program.


20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,937
This metadata should be in
the HEVC configuration box


21
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,873
and not stored in
individual sample data.


22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,745
For Dolby Vision content,
we support Profile 5,


23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,214
which is single-layer,
10-bit HEVC,


24
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,984
and up to level 7.


25
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,119
For both HDR formats,


26
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,723
the content must be encoded
using HEVC.


27
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,893
You should include HDR variants
of less than or equal to


28
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,594
30 frames per second.


29
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,197
And you must always provide
SDR variants


30
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,166
for both your
primary media content


31
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,568
as well as your
I-frame playlists.


32
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:47,040
In order to help devices
select compatible variants,


33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,142
we have added
a new video range tag


34
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,945
to the HLS specification.


35
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,848
If you include any
HDR variants in your playlist,


36
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,617
you must include this tag.


37
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,221
Declare SDR for any
standard dynamic range variants


38
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:05,692
and PQ for HDR10
or Dolby Vision variants.


39
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,694
This tag is an advisory
to the client


40
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,795
so that it will not attempt
to play streams


41
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,631
that it cannot support.


42
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,637
In order to support
HDCP TYPE-1 content protection,


43
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:22,309
the new TYPE-1 value has been
added to the HDCP level tag.


44
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,411
This value is typically
applied to content


45
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:28,181
with a resolution of
greater than 1920 by 1080.


46
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,384
This tag is also
advisory in nature


47
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,020
and prevents the client from
attempting to playback content


48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,257
that can't be supported by
the currently attached display.


49
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,160
To finish up, let's take
a quick look at a few examples


50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,630
of how a playlist differentiates
the different types of content


51
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,234
and how the tags we just
discussed are applied.


52
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,971
This is an example of a standard
dynamic range HEVC stream


53
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,241
that does not require HDCP.


54
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,310
This second example
describes a 4K HDR stream


55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,715
as indicated by the PQ value
of the "VIDEO-RANGE" tag.


56
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:05,552
The "CODECS" tag describes it
as a Dolby Vision stream,


57
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,522
and the "HDCP-LEVEL" tag
indicates that TYPE-1


58
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,823
will be required in order to


59
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:13,393
successfully
playback the stream.


60
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,163
This 4K HDR10 example
only differs from


61
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,299
the Dolby Vision example
by the "CODECS" tag.


62
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,936
The "VIDEO-RANGE" and
"HDCP-LEVEL" tags are the same.
