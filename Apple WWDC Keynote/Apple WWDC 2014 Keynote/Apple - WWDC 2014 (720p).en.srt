and enhanced support
for multiple displays.

174
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:19,743
Advanced technologies
for longer battery life

175
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,539
and greater performance.

176
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,311
And of course, new
and improved apps.

177
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,850
Just since its release in
October we've installed

178
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:31,587
over 40 million copies
of Mavericks.

179
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:37,254
This is the most of a single
release ever in Apple's history.

180
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:44,897
Also, that makes over 50 percent
of our installed base working

181
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:48,398
on our latest operating system.

182
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:51,601
This is the fastest
adoption ever

183
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:56,444
of any PC operating
system in history.

184
00:09:56,443 --> 00:10:01,043
Now, you may wonder how
that compares to Windows.

185
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,447
[ Laughter ]

186
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,049
I knew somebody was going to ask
so I decided to make a chart.

187
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,522
[ Laughter ]

188
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,190
Well, as it turns
out Windows 8 shipped

189
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:16,361
about a year before Mavericks
and it's at 14 percent.

190
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:20,434
[ Laughter ]

191
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,573

[ Applause ]

193
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:33,782
So, we could not be happier
with Mavericks and the momentum

194
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,450
of the Mac, but of course
we're always future focused.

195
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:41,951
And today, to talk about
the future of OS X,

196
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:45,195
I'd like to invite my
colleague up, Craig Federighi,

197
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,361
to tell us all about it.

198
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,599
Craig.

Good morning.

203
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:05,617
Well, it's wonderful to be here
presenting among the greatest

204
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:08,052
developers collected
in the world.

205
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,717
You guys are fantastic.

206
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:13,216
You know, it was just a
year ago, here at WWDC,

207
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:19,059
when we narrowly averted a
major OS X naming crisis.

208
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,798
[ Laughter ]

209
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:25,094
You may remember that we're able
to deftly shift from names based

210
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:30,308
on big cats to names based on
beautiful places in California,

211
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:33,903
starting of course
with OS X Mavericks.

212
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:37,847
Well, it's another year
and time for another name

213
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:42,614
and so we collected our
crack product marketing team,

214
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:47,525
shoved them in their VW Minibus
and set them out on the road.

215
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,090
Now, they first ventured south
discovering OS X, Oxnard.

216
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,031
[ Laughter ]

217
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,697
This wasn't quite right.

218
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:59,065
But undeterred, they
headed east,

219
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:02,335
landed in OS X Rancho Cucamonga.

220
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:04,605
[ Laughter ]

221
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,044
Still, we hadn't
quite hit the mark.

222
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,050
So, they boldly ventured
north landing at OS X Weed.

[ Applause ]

226
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:24,428
Strangely, this one had
large pockets of support

227
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:26,264
within the product
marketing organization,

228
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,999
but saner heads did
prevail and they set off

229
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:34,597
on what then was somewhat
more circuitous path.

230
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,371
It took them ultimately
to a place

231
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:40,409
that embodies the
beauty and power of OS X.

232
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:44,576
We discovered OS X Yosemite.

233
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:53,657
[ Applause ]

234
00:12:55,054 --> 00:13:00,364
Now, Yosemite is a fantastic new
release with a new interface,

235
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,530
big enhancements to
our most popular apps

236
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,429
and something all knew,
we call Continuity.

237
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:10,433
Now, I want to start
with design.

238
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:15,706
OS X, of course started with
the bold design of Aqua.

239
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,448
And over the years, it's evolved

240
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:23,184
to the refined look we all
loved today in Mavericks.

241
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:27,292
Well, with Yosemite, we
continue this evolution and I'd

242
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:32,557
like to give you a look
at where we're headed.

243
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:41,638
[ Music ]

244
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,551
How about that?

245
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,660
[ Applause ]

246
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:39,596
I think the team has done
some remarkable work.

247
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:43,262
You know, we started with the
most fundamental controls,

248
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:48,672
focused always on clarity,
as well as utility.

249
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:53,268
We refined the tool bars
and the window materials

250
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:55,272
and the window constructions.

251
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,944
If you look at the window title
bar, you'll see how the use

252
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,344
of translucent materials
gives you a sense of place

253
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:02,686
as you scroll your content.

254
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:05,852
Now, these same carefully
crafted translucent materials

255
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:07,722
are used in the sidebars.

256
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,760
So now, your windows take on
the personality of your desktop.

257
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,259
As you change your desktop
picture, your window adapts

258
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:19,432
to reflect that personality
and that temperature.

259
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:23,372
And the translucency also
helps maintain a sense of depth

260
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:28,279
and place as you move your
windows over one another.

261
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,844
Now, we also use the same
gorgeous translucent material

262
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:37,084
for the dock and check out these
beautifully crafted new icons.

263
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,353
So clean and yet so
fundamentally still Mac.

264
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:45,123
And check out the trash can,
that is a gorgeous trash can.

265
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,294
You wouldn't believe how
much time we spent crafting a

266
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,063
trash can.

267
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,131
[ Laughter ]

268
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:52,268
So, we also focused on precise

269
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,405
and consistent typography
throughout.

270
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,800
So, from the menus
to the window chrome

271
00:15:56,803 --> 00:16:00,943
to application control is
consistent and clear type.

272
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,780
Now, we know, for our pro users,
often, they really want to focus

273
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,977
on the center on the
screen and not be distracted

274
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:09,319
by bright menus and
bright docks,

275
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:13,515
so we also introduced
a dark mode.

00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,059
Yes. So, of course
these changes extend

279
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:24,732
through to the applications.

280
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,170
You notice here, with
Calendar, this construction

281
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,267
with a common toolbar
and title bar area

282
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,709
that makes the window both
more distinctly recognizable,

283
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:37,246
but more importantly maximizes
the space available for content.

284
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:38,413
And we carry this

285
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:41,881
over throughout the
system to apps like Maps.

286
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:45,481
Now, we also have a new look
for sidebar apps, like Messages,

287
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:47,885
you can see it here with the
beautiful translucent material

288
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:49,887
running top to bottom.

289
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,189
And we extend that look
to apps like FaceTime,

290
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,992
Contacts, and Reminders.

291
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:59,195
All in all they come
together for a gorgeous

292
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,508
and more usable version
of OS X, the best ever.

Next, let's talk about
Notification Center.

295
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:16,883
Notification Center
on OS X, of course,

296
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:20,053

It also now, most importantly,
has a new Today view.

299
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:30,366
So, you get an at-a-glance
look at your Calendar,

300
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:35,533
your Reminders, Weather, and
more, but most importantly,

301
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,235
you can extend the contents of
Today view with the contents

302
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:42,878
of widgets and apps that you've
downloaded from the App Store.

303
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,615
Just add them right in and set
up the Today view, that you want

304
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:50,152
for at-a-glance access
to information.

305
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:53,549

Next up. Spotlight.

308
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,432
So Spotlight has always
been a superfast way

309
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:06,468
to launch applications and
find content local on your Mac.

310
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:08,805
And Yosemite is a
great new interface.

311
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,201
So when you click on
the magnifying glass

312
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,874
on the toolbar you'll
get a big field right

313
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,002
in the middle of the display.

314
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,776
And if you just type
a few characters,

315
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:20,146
you can launch an app just
like that, or type the name

316
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,816
of a document and you
get great search results

317
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,915
and an inline preview,
it's really awesome.

318
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,888
Now, in addition to these
sources, local to your Mac,

319
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:32,458
we also tap into sources of
information on the internet.

320
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,798
So for instance, type a few
characters in like Yosemite,

321
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:39,165
you can get news feed,
information from Wikipedia,

322
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:42,265
and even maps all
at your finger tips.

323
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:44,038
I'd like to give
you a quick demo

324
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:47,536
of the new UI in Yosemite now.

So here is our first
look at Yosemite live.

328
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:58,821
So we see our beautiful new
typography in our menus,

329
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:02,588
this gorgeous new dock
and these beautiful icons.

330
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,958
Let's launch an app.

331
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,296
I'm going to start here with
Maps and I want you to observe

332
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,932
that as I scroll the
content of the map,

333
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:12,568
the way that the title bar
actually reacts its translucency

334
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:17,035
and color to the content
beneath is just really gorgeous.

335
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:19,606
I'm going to launch
now another app.

336
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:23,375
Calendar. So Calendar has
a new look for a week view

337
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:25,646
but also an all new day view.

338
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,245
And you notice here on day
view, I have all of my meetings

339
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,747
in the day right
here on the left,

340
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,950
and on the right I got
details about my appointments.

341
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,722
So for instance,
here at 2 o'clock,

342
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,660
we have our executive
karaoke outing,

343
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:39,756
that's going to be big blast.

344
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,129
It's right there.

345
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:43,167
You want to probably drop in
on that if you get the chance.

346
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:46,432
So let's take a look
now at Messages.

347
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:47,902
So Messages, you see this use

348
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,270
of the translucent sidebar
material, how it reacts subtly

349
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,440
to the background is really
nice, and how the contents

350
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,180
of the title bar react as I
scroll content underneath.

351
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:00,318
It's really cool.

352
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:03,153
Let's take a look at
Notification Center.

353
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:05,419
So of course, I have
my notifications here,

354
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:08,688
but I also have Today view
so I can see my Calendar

355
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,258
at a glance, my Weather.

356
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,626
These are interactive so I
can click, get hourly weather,

357
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:16,996
clock, interact with stocks for
instance, or even Reminders.

358
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,396
So here I'm supposed to practice
for the demo and I forgot to do

359
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:20,968
that but it's too late now.

360
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,836
So, we'll send out
one on its way.

361
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:26,005
Now, of course, I can edit
these widgets as well,

362
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,505
just click the Edit
button down here

363
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,006
and you see widgets available
to me right here on the side.

364
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,709
These are all from apps
that can export widgets.

365
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,752
So I'm just going to
drag out Calculator,

366
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:38,417
add that in here just like that
or even a third party widget.

367
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,057
Let's drag one of those
in, ESPN SportsCenter.

368
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:45,523
So right there, I get all my
information right at a glance.

369
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:47,594
It's really awesome.

[ Applause ]

371
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,265
So next. Spotlight.

372
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:57,036
So I'm going to click here on
the magnifying glass and, boom,

373
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:59,276
got a search field right in
the middle of the screen.

374
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,571
I can type just a couple of
characters to launch an app

375
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,174
like our new reminders.

376
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:03,845
There it is.

377
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:05,213
It's that easy.

378
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:07,551
But of course, Spotlight is
great for looking up people too.

379
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,816
So I'm going to look
up Phil Schiller here.

380
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:11,155
There's Phil.

381
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,790
And you see I have all of
his contact information here,

382
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:16,286
but I also have matches
on mail from Phil.

383
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,388
Phil and I are planning
a camping trip.

384
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,091
He's a bit of a gear nut
and has something he wants

385
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,662
to try out on our trip.

386
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,000
We also have Events
and Reminders.

387
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:27,996
So we have here that our Meeting
at the Campsite and-- oh, good.

388
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,800
I see that Jeff and Johnny are
both in on the trip as well.

389
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:35,304
And I'll tell you, you just have
not had chili by the campfire

390
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:36,447
until you've eaten it with one

391
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,082
of Johnny's custom
crafted aluminium spoons.

It's a-- it's the diamond
cut chamfered edges

00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:44,955
that really make the experience.

395
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:50,792
So, I'm working on a document
as well to help plan our trip.

396
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,690
Now, there are a lot of ways
of course to find documents,

397
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,291
but one way now is by app.

398
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,133
So this is a numbers document.

399
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,468
I typed numbers and you
see in addition to the app,

400
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:02,034
I get all my recent documents
that I've opened with that app

401
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,134
and I can access
them right here.

402
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,975
So let's open up my hiking trip.

403
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,680
And here we see that the trip
has planned involved a 16.4 mile

404
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:14,676
hike and you're being an
operations professional.

405
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,080
Jeff is a big stickler
for the metric system.

406
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,722
And so, fortunately,
Spotlight has my back.

407
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:23,828
I can just type in
16.4 miles here

408
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:27,063
and I get an instant
conversion to kilometers.

409
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,359
So that's awfully handy.

410
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,960
We do all kinds of conversion.

411
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:33,302
They drop that in, fix
that document right up.

Well, that's enough
for my document.

415
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:41,437
I can also do great searches
like just type a few characters,

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,080
bang, I've got Yosemite
entry from Wikipedia.

I've got news from
various sources.

418
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,618
I even have maps right here.

419

Well, you know, I'm looking to
plan a dinner and maybe a movie

420

out and now without
even launching an app,

I can just do a look up
for sushi for instance.

results right here,

to map information,

to go out to a movie.

in Godzilla here.

Now-- OK, intriguing.

So, we all know that
documents in the Cloud,

way for working with an app

to your Mac you can
get a content from apps

So, Mail in Yosemite has an
elegant new Yosemite style UI.

between mailboxes, quick fetches

to address a fundamental problem

464
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:26,008
with email, which is these
days we so often want

465
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:28,205
to send large attachments
whether it's videos

recipient's mail server can't

take those large attachments.

Well, we're solving that problem

00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:41,183

we call Mail Drop.

your message bouncing off your

recipient's mail
server, you can elect

473
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:50,226
to have the attachment
sent encrypted

474
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:53,099
and securely via iCloud
separate from the message

475
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:55,668
and it rendezvous on
the receiving end.

So, if your recipient has a Mac,
they get it just like before.

And if they have another
client, they get a link

to securely download
those attachments.

be up to 5 gigs in size.

signature right on the trackpad

into the email message

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,570
you also get spotlight
suggestions right there

512
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,936
in your completion menu.

513
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:39,734
And this means, you can get
things faster than ever before.

514
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:43,938
Now, Safari is also more
powerful than ever with sharing.

515
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:48,012
So now, if you want to subscribe
to an RSS feed on the site,

516
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:49,683
you can do that right here

517
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,951
and those RSS feed
articles will show up right

518
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,890
in your Safari sidebar
under Shared Links.

519
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:58,527
And you can also share to
people more quickly than ever,

520
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:00,294
because Safari lists the
people you've message

521
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:03,762
with most recently, and with
just one click you can share

522
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,532
a webpage.

523
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:09,971
Now, Safari is better than
ever as well with tabs.

524
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:13,708
We now have a tab view that
gives you a bird's-eye glance

525
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:18,045
of all of your tabs and it
stacks tabs from sites just

526
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,083
like this so you get
individual stacks

527
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:23,378
for each site that
you're browsing.

528
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,182
Safari is also great
when it comes to privacy.

529
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:29,185
Safari was the first browser
to introduce private browsing

530
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:30,888
and now it's easier than ever,

531
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:33,759
because you can create
a new private window.

532
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,799
And when you do, all the
content within that window

533
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:39,595
and all its tabs
stay private and all

534
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:42,538
of your other windows
are unaffected.

535
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:44,074
It's really handy.

536
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:47,369
Now, Safari is great when
it comes to standards.

537
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:51,272
It has WebGL now for
superfast 3D graphics,

538
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:56,486
SPDY for efficient networking,
and HTML Premium Video.

539
00:28:56,481 --> 00:29:01,321
Now, this enables modern Macs
to efficiently stream video

540
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,690
from site like Netflix
without a plug-in

541
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:06,159
and the results are awesome.

542
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:09,358
You get up to two hours
longer battery life

543
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,601
on a MacBook Air
streaming Netflix.

544
00:29:11,597 --> 00:29:14,267
And that's for 1080P video.

545
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:17,736
Now, Safari has been
set the benchmark really

546
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:20,536
for energy efficiency
since Mavericks

547
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:22,879
and its lead here continues.

548
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:26,315
When it comes to multi-tab
browser energy efficiency,

549
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,281
Safari is without equal.

550
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,550
And when it comes to the
kind of UI manipulations

551
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:35,389
that are typical in web apps,
Safari is faster than ever.

552
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:36,957
And how about JavaScript?

553
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:39,955
Well, take the most complex kind
of JavaScript that's typical

554
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,328
of very rich web applications.

555
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:47,467
Well, Safari now has a Fourth
Tier LLVM-based optimized

556
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:52,376
JavaScript Compiler that is the
fastest of any major browser.

557
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:57,241
And when it comes to
typical website JavaScript,

558
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,012
Safari is in a league
of its own.

559
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:01,142
So of that is Safari.

560
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,546
And to give you a quick
demo, I'd like to bring

561
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:05,218
up Brian Crowe to the stage.

562
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:05,847
Let's give him a big welcome.

563
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:06,551
Brian.

564
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:11,721
[ Applause ]

565
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:14,093
&gt; Thanks Craig.

566
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,332
I'm really happy
to be here today.

567
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:19,098
So, I'm just going to
dive right into Safari.

568
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:20,337
Here we go.

569
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:23,102
It's really great.

570
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,371
And when you go to a website,

571
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:29,211
you can really appreciate
the new design.

572
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:32,807
It's simpler and it's
even more powerful.

573
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:36,951
I can open up the sidebar really
easily to get at my Bookmarks,

574
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:40,219
my Reading List as well
as my Shared Links.

575
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:46,558
And when I click into the Search
field, I get instant access

576
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,358
to all my favorite sites.

577
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,830
It's really nice.

578
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:51,028
So, I'm going to
go ahead and type

579
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,499
in a search for Ansel Adams.

580
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:54,998
There we go.

581
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,340
And if I hit return,
I can just go

582
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:59,906
to a regular old Google search.

583
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:04,915
But, since Ansel Adams
is a common search term,

584
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,750
I get this new Spotlight
suggestion there at the top.

585
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:11,187
It has a snippet of
information from Wikipedia.

586
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:14,953
I can read it there, or
if I'd like I can go ahead

587
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:18,823
and see the entire article
right on the Wikipedia site.

588
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:21,294
It's super convenient.

589
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:27,033
Now, if you use tabs,
you're going to love this.

590
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:30,602
Now, no matter how many
tabs I have opened,

591
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:34,002
I can smoothly scroll
through them to get at any

592
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:35,676
of that tab I'm looking for.

593
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,144
It's really nice.

594
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:39,212
[ Applause ]

595
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:42,811
So now, sometimes I want to
see my tabs so I can go ahead

596
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:46,254
and do this and I'll click
on the new Tab View button.

597
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:49,121
And there you go, a
beautiful bird's eye view

598
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,391
of all my open tabs.

599
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:53,629
So, I'm going to go ahead
and select this one here.

600
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:57,125
It's a photoblog with a
bunch of pictures of Yosemite

601
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:00,729
and there's a couple of good
ones of El Capitan down below.

602
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:02,832
So, I'll find in
there El Capitan.

603
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,974
And then I'm going
to choose this one.

604
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,510
Now, I want to share it
with Craig so I'm going

605
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:08,075
to get the high-res image.

606
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,613
Now, sharing couldn't
be easier in Safari.

607
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:13,479
I just simply click on
the Share button here,

608
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:16,818
and now I can use the new
recent recipients feature

609
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:18,785
to address it to Craig.

610
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:20,984
And here we go.

611
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:24,786
And with just one click, I'm
ready to send that image.

612
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,590
It's that easy.

613
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:29,031
So-- But before I send it,

614
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,527
I'm going to add my
two cents to this.

615
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,030
So, I can go here and we
have just the right feature

616
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:35,632
called Markup.

617
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:38,604
Now with Markup, I
can edit this image

618
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:40,973
without ever even leaving Mail.

619
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,472
It's really great.

620
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:45,414
So, what I'm going to do
is annotate this image

621
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,950
with a nice magnifying
glass a loop.

622
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:50,617
So, you move it around
you can say

623
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:52,315
that it magnifies
everything underneath it.

624
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:54,587
So, I'm going to
place it right here.

625
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:57,726
And it turns out
that those two specs

626
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:01,122
on the big granite face there,
they're actually climbers.

627
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:02,126
It's kind of crazy.

628
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,467
So, I'm going to
zoom it a little more

629
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:04,762
so you can see it better.

630
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:06,363
There we go.

631
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:09,204
So, I can zoom nicely
and place it here.

632
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:12,571
Now, I want to point this
out to Craig in the mail.

633
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:16,571
And I can use my trackpad
to draw on the image.

634
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:19,175
So, I'm going to go ahead
and draw an arrow here.

635
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:21,277
There we go.

636
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,119
And you notice Markup's smart
enough to recognize the arrow

637
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:27,587
and make it really pretty.

638
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:32,596
So now-- now, it's really
easy to add a comment.

639
00:33:32,591 --> 00:33:36,631
And so, check out the climbers.

640
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,028
There we go.

641
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:41,529
Now, I can have a little
fun with this, so I'm going

642
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:45,073
to go ahead and create
a cartoon bubble, OK?

643
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,910
I'm not so good at drawing
but Markup's going to help me.

644
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,807
There we go.

645
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,149
So, luckily you can
clean that up [phonetic],

646
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:53,574
it's better than I am.

647
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:56,148
So now I can add a caption.

648
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,888
And so, I think I'm
going to appeal

649
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,783
to the inner developer
and all of us.

650
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:05,994
I'm going to type in
"I hope the rope is,"

651
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:09,461
wait for it, "multithreaded."

652
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,530
Yeah.

653
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:15,731
[ Laughter ]

654
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:18,574
OK. So, I think I've done
enough to this picture.

655
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,570
Time to go.

656
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,343
So, now it's ready
for me to mail

657
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:25,311
and I can just click like that.

658
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,050
So that's how easy it is
to Markup an image in Mail.

659
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:31,318
So, those are just a couple

660
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:34,586
of great new features
in Safari in Mail.

661
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:35,556
Thank you.

663
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:45,565
How about that
parallel programming joke.

664
00:34:45,564 --> 00:34:47,764
You did not see that coming.

665
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,672
Next, something entirely
different.

666
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:54,741
It's called the Continuity.

667
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,009
So now at Apple, we
believe you should be able

668
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:59,908
to use the right
device for the moment.

669
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:04,011
Maybe your phone when you're on
the go, your iPad when you want

670
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,555
to kick back on the
couch, or maybe your Mac

671
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,091
when you're trying to
get some work done.

672
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:12,186
But we also want the transitions
between these moments

673
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,860
to be absolutely as natural
and seamless as possible.

674
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:20,161
Now, our Continuity features
start with something simple

675
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:22,965
and that's AirDrop,
because now AirDrop works

676
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:24,538
between iOS and the Mac.

[ Applause ]

678
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:35,184
It's really convenient.

679
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,920
But now we have something
that we really take it

to the next level and
that's called Handoff.

681

So, it turns out now that when
you're working on your Mac,

682
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:50,291
your devices around you
in proximity are aware

683
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:53,695
of each other and aware
of what you're up to.

684
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:56,598
And so, if you want to pick up
where you left off on your Mac

685
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:59,801
and your iPad, your iPad
is prompting you right

686
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:01,544
in the lower left of the screen.

687
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,639
Just swipe up and you
can pick up working

688
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:07,283

your Mac right on your iPad.

689

This works in the other
direction as well.

692
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:20,657
So, let's say, you're
composing an email on your phone

693
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:22,659
and you walk up to your Mac.

694
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,761
Well, your Mac will
notice what you're doing

695
00:36:24,763 --> 00:36:26,963
and prompt you right
on the dock.

696
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:29,365
You click it and you
can pick up finishing

697
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,537

699
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:42,416
Now, we've been able to take
this same proximity awareness

700
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:45,354
and make the process of
creating a hotspot easier

701
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,890
than ever before.

702
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:49,585
So now, if you're using your Mac
and you're away from a network

703
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:53,457
but your phone is nearby, when
you go up to your Wi-Fi menu,

configuration ever have been

done on your phone, sees
your phone and prompts you

706
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,831
so you click it and it
automatically sets up a hotspot.

707
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,234
You never type a
password and you're

708
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:06,505
on the network that easily.

710
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,443
And this works even
if your phone is

across the room sitting
in a handbag.

712
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:17,413
You just never have to touch it.

713
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:21,685
Now, the next that we really
wanted to handle is SMS.

00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:25,126
Now, we all love iMessage.

00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:27,163
We can continue our
conversations seamlessly

00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:30,298

then we have these green

And, you know, they have
inferior devices and they insist

719
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,609
on sending us messages,
and we don't want

720
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:40,804
to hold it against them.

721
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:43,605
But the problem is that
those messages don't show

722
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:49,078
up on our other devices
until now, because now--

Now, believe it or not,

727
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:05,532
we're able to do the same
thing with phone calls.

728
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,630
So now, when you
receive a phone call,

729
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:14,304
your Mac gives you caller ID
and you can even accept the call

730
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,505
and use your Mac
as a speaker phone.

And believe it or not, this
works even if your phone is

across the house in a charger.

734
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,597
You never have to miss a call.

735
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:39,263
Well, now that your
Mac is all phone savvy,

736
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:41,564
it's also a great way
to dial the phone.

737
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:44,206
So, if you're in Contacts and
you want to dial a number,

you can do it right there.

And even on a webpage, you
see a number you want to call,

you can call it right
from your Mac.

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,990
So, if you're a non-developer
and you want

851
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:06,186
to help us improve Yosemite,
you can sign up on the web

852
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,590
and you can receive access

853
00:44:08,593 --> 00:44:11,293
to Yosemite betas
throughout the summer.

854
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:14,335
That is OS X Yosemite.

855
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:15,262
I think you're going to love it.

856
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:15,796
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.

857
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,330
Thank you.

858
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:18,104
[ Applause ]

859
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:19,542
Thank, Craig.

860
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:26,077
[ Applause ]

861
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:27,107
It's a really terrific release.

862
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,181
I'm just glad I'm
in the beta program.

863
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,320
[ Laughter ]

864
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:33,555
Next up is iOS.

865
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:37,021
[ Applause ]

866
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:44,191
We've now sold well over 800
million iOS devices and each

867
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:47,995
of the categories of devices has
set its own significant sales

868
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,099
record in the past year.

869
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:54,741
iPod Touch has passed
100 million units.

870
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:58,779
iPad has passed 200
million units.

871
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:03,616
And iPhone has passed
half a billion units.

872
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:05,554
This is incredible.

873
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,560
But what's even more impressive
is how many new customers

874
00:45:10,555 --> 00:45:15,565
to Apple that iOS
devices has brought to us.

875
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:22,100
Over 130 million customers
who bought an iOS device

876
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:28,539
in the past 12 months was
buying their first Apple device.

877
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:34,649
[ Applause ]

878
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:41,385
Now, many of these customers
were switchers from Android.

879
00:45:42,587 --> 00:45:48,157
They had bought an
Android phone by mistake.

880
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,259
[ Laughter ]

881
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:56,271
And then had sought a better
experience and a better life.

882
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,467
[ Laughter ]

883
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:03,839
And decided to check
out iPhone and iOS.

884
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:09,611
Nearly, in fact, nearly half
of our customers in China

885
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:15,854
in the past six months
switched from Android to iPhone.

886
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:17,953
This is incredible and of course

887
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:22,795
that better experience
is our devices in iOS.

888
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:27,663
And iOS 7 took that
experience to even higher level.

889
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:33,435
The customer sat with iOS
7 is really off the charts.

890
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:38,677
Change wave recently
measured it at 97 percent.

891
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:43,316
These are customer sat
ratings that no one gets.

892
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:46,054
It's really enormous.

893
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:53,860
Now, one of the reasons why
customers say they love iOS is

894
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:58,098
that we make available
our software updates

895
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:02,865
for the OS available to as
many customers as possible.

896
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:07,407
And, if you look at what
has happened with iOS 7,

897
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:11,845
our latest release,
almost 9 out of 10 people

898
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:16,512
in our install base are running
our latest operating system.

899
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:22,954
[ Applause ]

900
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:26,454
Now, this is in stark
contrast to Android.

901
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:28,857
[ Laughter ]

902
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:33,429
If you look at their latest
release, less than one out of 10

903
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:37,671
of their customers are
on their latest software.

904
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:43,738
And, if you look at a
broader group, over a third

905
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:47,041
of their customers
are running a version

906
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:52,314
of Android from four years ago.

907
00:47:52,316 --> 00:47:54,556
That's like ancient history.

908
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:57,652
[ Laughter ]

909
00:47:57,655 --> 00:48:02,595
Now, that means that these
customers are not getting great

910
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:04,433
new features.

911
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:08,098
They're not able to
run your latest apps.

912
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,599
And, they don't get
security updates

913
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:15,142
that they may need to stay safe.

914
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:18,539
And, this is particularly
important for Android

915
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:21,512
which dominates the
mobile malware market.

916
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:24,652
[ Laughter ]

917
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:29,458
No wonder experts are
saying things like this.

918
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:31,953
Android fragmentation
is turning devices

919
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:37,196
into a toxic hell stew
of vulnerabilities.

920
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:44,634
Now, fortunately, iOS hasn't
had this kind of issues

921
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:49,175
because we do everything we can
to make our updates available

922
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:51,973
to as many people as possible.

923
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:58,486
So, we could not be
happier with iOS 7

924
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,682
and the momentum of iOS devices.

925
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:05,124
But, we are not standing still.

926
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:08,492
Today, we're announcing iOS 8.

927
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:16,032
[ Applause ]

928
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:19,933
And, iOS 8 is a giant release

929
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:23,237
and it's really two
stories not one.

930
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,550
It has great end user features.

931
00:49:27,545 --> 00:49:32,385
But, it also has
incredible developer features

932
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:36,883
so you can extend your
experience and build apps

933
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,787
that you couldn't do before.

934
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,360
We'd like to get started with
describing it with talking

935
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,460
about the end user features.

936
00:49:45,463 --> 00:49:48,263
And, to do that, I'd
like to bring Craig back

937
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:48,695
up to the stage.

938
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:49,529
Craig?

939
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:57,073
[ Applause ]

940
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:58,744
I missed you guys.

941
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:03,312
So, what? Let's talk
about iOS 8.

942
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:08,584
Now, iOS 8 of course builds
on the design of iOS 7

943
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:12,186
with enhancements for
both iPhone and iPad.

944
00:50:12,189 --> 00:50:14,389
And, let's start with the phone.

945
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:18,761
Now, in iOS 8, we've
refined notification center.

946
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:24,232
But, what I really love are our
new interactive notifications.

947
00:50:24,235 --> 00:50:28,575
So now, if you get a message
like this, just pull down

948
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:31,112
and you can reply from
right where you are.

949
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,108
[ Applause ]

950
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,780
You don't have to leave
the app you're in.

951
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:37,618
And this works for all
kinds of notifications.

952
00:50:37,615 --> 00:50:40,385
If you get a calendar event
for instance, just pull down

953
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:44,224
and respond and it works
on the lock screen.

954
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:46,361
So, you can just swipe
across in the lock screen.

955
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:48,227
You get those action
buttons tapped

956
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:50,925
and you've dealt
with it right there.

957
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:55,028
Now, in iOS 7, we gave you
quick double-tap access to get

958
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:57,032
at your most recent apps.

959
00:50:57,034 --> 00:51:00,404
Well now, you can also use
that same double tap to get

960
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:04,004
at the people you communicate
with most frequently.

961
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:05,708
It's really handy.

962
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:10,679
And, in iOS 7, we introduce
this great Tab View in Safari.

963
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:13,951
Well, we're bringing a great
Tab View to iPad as well

964
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:17,151
with this bird's eye
view of all of your tabs.

965
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:21,194
And, Safari also picks up
the Side Bar that we love

966
00:51:21,192 --> 00:51:24,962
in Yosemite with access to your
bookmarks, your reading list

967
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:26,732
and your shared links.

968
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,470
Now, we've made managing your
mail easier than ever before.

969
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:32,607
So now, if you're reading a
message, you want to remember

970
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:34,673
to get back to it so you're
going to mark it on red.

971
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:37,412
We can do that with
just a single gesture.

972
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,648
And, if you want
to flag a message,

973
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,383
you can just pull across,
there's a flag option.

974
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:43,078
But, if you pull
all the way across,

975
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,720
you can delete with
just a gesture.

976
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:48,456
But the piece I love the
best is what we've done

977
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:50,022
with composing messages.

978
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,490
Have you ever found
yourself composing an email

979
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,089
and then you really wish like
you get at something else

980
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:57,762
in your inbox maybe
for that reply?

981
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:58,901
Well now, you can.

982
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:01,966
Just swipe that message
down and you have access

983
00:52:01,966 --> 00:52:03,536
to the rest of your mail.

984
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:09,674
[ Applause ]

985
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:11,143
So, I'd like to give
you a demo of some

986
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:17,011
of these great iOS
8 enhancements now.

987
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:22,584
So, here we are on
our iOS 8 lock screen.

988
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,456
And, if I receive
a notification,

989
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:26,855
it looks like I happen to
get one just right then,

990
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:30,797
I can swipe across and you see
I have action so I can accept

991
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:32,094
or decline this meeting
right here.

992
00:52:32,096 --> 00:52:35,496
And, of course, I'm
going to use the device,

993
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:39,869
if I'm in here maybe playing
some music here on iTunes radio,

994
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,170
I might get a notification.

995
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:47,413
And, if I do get notification, I
can just swipe down on it, too.

996
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:49,811
So, here's one, just swipe down.

997
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:51,913
Now, I get access
to my keyboard.

998
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,455
I can type right there.

999
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:57,221
Now, this works great for
third party apps as well.

1000
00:52:57,221 --> 00:53:00,461
So, for instance, looks like
I got tagged on Facebook,

1001
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:04,427
I can like it right here with
an actionable notification.

1002
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,068
And, sometimes, you
receive notifications

1003
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,903
that you just really don't
want deal with right now

1004
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:11,268
and you can just flick
those away like that.

1005
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:12,638
That's really handy.

1006
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:15,806
Now, we've made getting at
people easier than ever before.

1007
00:53:15,806 --> 00:53:17,376
So, if I just double-tap
my Home button,

1008
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:20,814
so I have all the people I most
recently communicated with.

1009
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:24,481
I swipe to the side and I have
access to all my favorites.

1010
00:53:24,481 --> 00:53:28,521
If I tap on one, I have controls
here to give them a phone call,

1011
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,289
iMessage them or even
FaceTime right here

1012
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:35,429
with just a double-tap
on the Home button.

1013
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:37,096
It's really handy.

1014
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:38,124
Now, I want to show you some

1015
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:40,628
of the enhancements
we made to mail.

1016
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:44,401
Let's go take a look an
iPad actually this time.

1017
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,271
So, here we are on iPad.

1018
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:47,969
I'm going to launch mail.

1019
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:50,511
Now, I have a number
of unread messages here

1020
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:52,207
so let's work our
way through them.

1021
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:56,579
Here's a message from Open
Table with a dinner appointment.

1022
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,190
And, you notice that the
reservation is actually called

1023
00:54:01,185 --> 00:54:02,555
out right here on the top.

1024
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:05,053
Mail has actually given me an
intelligent suggestion here

1025
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,155
to add it to my calendar.

1026
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:08,826
I can tap Add and just
like this, it lets--

1027
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:12,466
it prompts me to fill out and
add an event to my calendar.

1028
00:54:12,463 --> 00:54:14,133
That's really handy.

1029
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:16,371
Now, sometimes, you
get a message like this

1030
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:18,167
where you're going to have
to do some thinking about it.

1031
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:19,538
Maybe get back to it later.

1032
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:23,876
Well now, with just a single
swipe, I can mark it as unread.

1033
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:25,274
It's really cool.

1034
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,215
You can also flag really easily.

1035
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:29,311
So, this is a message
I want to flag.

1036
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:32,653
Just flick it across and flag.

1037
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:34,049
Now, here's a nice message.

1038
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:37,251
I don't know who this fellow is
but he says great collaboration.

1039
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:40,294
You and Johnny have really
come together really well.

1040
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,390
Let's take a look at that one.

1041
00:54:42,393 --> 00:54:43,063
Oh, dear God.

[ Laughter ]

1043
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:45,501
Well, this would be a good time

1044
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:47,896
to demonstrate our
quick delete feature.

1045
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:51,038
So, I can drag all the way
across and delete at a glance.

1046
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:52,774
I'm certain that
message won't haunt me

1047
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,670
on the internet for
years to come.

1048
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:57,042
So, let's talk about composing.

1049
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,280
I got a message here from a
friend who's visiting in town,

1050
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:01,377
who's looking for
a good restaurant.

1051
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:03,848
So, I'll start replying
to this message.

1052
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:08,217
And, I'll say, let's see--
check out and then, you know,

1053
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:09,958
actually I got a
good recommendation

1054
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:11,353
from another friend
here in my inbox,

1055
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:12,655
so I'd like to get to that now.

1056
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:16,856
Well, I can just swipe
this draft down like this.

1057
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,960
Go right into another
place, another message

1058
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:23,102
in my inbox, tap
out a selection.

1059
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,770
That looks like exactly
what I want to send him

1060
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:25,838
so I'll just copy that.

1061
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:27,406
And now, with a tap
at the bottom,

1062
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:30,674
I restore my draft
just like that.

1063
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:33,474
I can paste and send
it on its way.

1064
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:36,347
I think we're all going to
love doing mail this way.

1065
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,546
That's a quick look, few
enhancements to iOS 8.

[ Applause ]

1067
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:46,461
So, let's talk about Spotlight.

1068
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:48,797
And of course, Spotlight
is a super convenient way

1069
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:49,892
to search in your device.

1070
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:51,933
You just pull down one
on your home screen

1071
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,359
and you can execute
these searches,

1072
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:57,103
find things like launching
apps or find an email message.

1073
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,170
But now, with those same things
we showed you in Yosemite,

1074
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:03,910
with Spotlight Suggestions,
you can get it so much more.

1075
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:06,747
You can search for apps and find
matches of apps that you don't

1076
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:09,013
yet have on the App Store.

1077
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:11,012
You can search for
points of interest

1078
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:13,814
and get Wikipedia
entries and directions.

1079
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:19,157
You can search for news,
search for restaurants, songs,

1080
00:56:19,156 --> 00:56:21,926
not just in your own
library but also on iTunes.

1081
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:25,265
And, when you search for a
movie, you can get results both

1082
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:30,832
for theaters nearby as well as
content available for streaming.

1083
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:34,934
And, when you search
inside of Safari in addition

1084
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:37,278
to your great Google
Search suggestions,

1085
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:39,644
you can also get a
suggestion at a glance

1086
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:41,713
for the answer you're
looking for right

1087
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:43,752
from Spotlight Suggestions.

1088
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:46,187
So, that is the new Spotlight.

1089
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:52,193
Next, the keyboard and the
technology we call QuickType.

1090
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,059
Oh.

1091
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,826
[ Laughter ]

1092
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:59,165
So, prior to iPhone, this
was the state-of-the-art

1093
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:00,632
in smartphone typing.

1094
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:04,131
But, iPhone changed all of that
with the introduction of Touch.

1095
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:07,534
And, we've been able to do
so much more like access

1096
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:11,378
to special characters or
alternate character sets,

1097
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:16,415
special keyboard layouts, even
handwriting and dictation.

1098
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:20,683
But, underlying it all have
been the language models

1099
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:22,954
under autocorrect.

1100
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:28,163
Well now, in iOS 8,
QuickType supports predictive

1101
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:29,698
typing suggestions.

1102
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:32,593
So, as you type,
you get suggestions

1103
00:57:32,596 --> 00:57:34,636
for the next words you
might want to type,

1104
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:38,171
and you can tap things out
faster than ever before

1105
00:57:38,168 --> 00:57:40,338
and it's incredibly smart.

1106
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:42,407
So, it's context sensitive.

1107
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:44,306
For instance in messages,
if someone asks you,

1108
00:57:44,308 --> 00:57:45,608
do you want to go for
dinner or a movie?

1109
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:48,549

dinner or a movie.

And, it's personalized.

1112
00:57:58,188 --> 00:57:59,628
It learns how you type

1113
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,823
to different people
in different apps.

1114
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:04,395
So, maybe you're communicating
with a co-worker and it's going

1115
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:07,434
to say, well, the meeting was
canceled, rescheduled, moved.

1116
00:58:07,431 --> 00:58:09,871
These are kind of formal terms.

1117
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,236
But now, if you're
communicating with someone else,

1118
00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:13,904
we have a different
communication style,

1119
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:17,544
you might get the meeting was
epic, awesome or a snoozer

1120
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,581
because it learns how you type.

1121
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:22,247
And, when it does, it does

1122
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:25,685
so in a way that's always
protecting your privacy.

1123
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:28,322
All that learning is done
local to the device and none

1124
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:31,118
of your keystrokes
leave the device.

1125
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:33,661
Now, QuickType has
great language models

1126
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:35,527

01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:11,180
For one, Craig and Kim decided
to share their location with me.

1184
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:12,651
So Craig of course
is up here with us

1185
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:16,919
in San Francisco while Kim is
working hard back in Cupertino.

1186
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,120
Thanks Kim for that.

1187
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:20,821
One of the things I
can do is add contacts.

1188
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:22,724
I can add people to this
conversation as we go,

1189
01:01:22,726 --> 01:01:25,526
but I can also choose
to share my location.

1190
01:01:25,529 --> 01:01:27,369
So if I just tap and Share
My Location, I can choose

1191
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:30,404
to share my location for an
hour for the rest of the day

1192
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,040
or I can keep sharing it until
I stop somewhere in the future.

1193
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:37,277
But what's really convenient
is this Do Not Disturb button.

1194
01:01:37,274 --> 01:01:38,914
How many times you've
been in one

1195
01:01:38,909 --> 01:01:41,349
of those super chatty
group conversations

1196
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:42,844
that your phone is
just continuing

1197
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:44,646
to buzz over and over?

1198
01:01:44,648 --> 01:01:46,888
Well now, I can just
choose to Do Not Disturb

1199
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:50,183
that particular thread and
not get my phone buzzing.

1200
01:01:50,187 --> 01:01:51,687
So, I'm going to find
that useful with Kim

1201
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:54,258
and Craig, I know that for sure.

1202
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:55,957
Or I can even Leave
this Conversation

1203
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:57,499
with just a single tap.

1204
01:01:57,494 --> 01:01:58,964
What's also convenient
is the fact

1205
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,632
that I have all the
attachments, all the photos

1206
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,731
from this conversation
all in one place.

1207
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:07,233
So they still appear in line
in the thread but now instead

1208
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:09,537
of trying to find that picture
by scrolling, scrolling,

1209
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:12,379
scrolling, they all come in
one place here in the thread,

1210
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,745
so very, very convenient.

1211
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:15,513
So let's go back to
that conversation,

1212
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:17,182
Kim had asked me how it's going.

1213
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,950
Well, I have lots of
ways to reply to her.

1214
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:21,349
I could tap out which just
a few taps and, you know,

1215
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:23,621
use my predictive
keyboard, a message.

1216
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,760
But it's even cooler that I can
now do an audio or video message

1217
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:28,556
to her with just a swipe.

1218
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:32,028
So I'll send back an
audio message to her.

1219
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:35,828
Hey Kim, I'm just hanging
out here with about 6,000

Slide up, sends the
message just like that.

Super easy.

1225
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:47,312
And I can do the same
thing with a video message

1226
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,410
or even with a selfie.

1227
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:50,111
So I'm going to dare
a selfie here.

1228
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:53,583

Not my best look.

1231
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:06,493
Let's see what Kim
has to say about that.

1232
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:08,866
So, I can-- see, I got an
audio message from Kim,

1233
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:11,965
all I have to do is tap the play
button and hear the message.

1234
01:03:11,968 --> 01:03:13,108

1235
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:16,473
You've totally mastered
the duck face selfie.

1236
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:18,513
Well, I'm glad she likes it.

1237
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:21,548
So it's super duper easy
to do this sort of things.

1238
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:23,514
You notice that it said it
would expire in a couple

1239
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:25,413
of minutes 'cause you don't
want to have this clean this up.

1240
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:27,155
Audio and video messages
can take up space

so it self-destruct
unless you choose

1242
01:03:28,652 --> 01:03:30,652
to keep-- whoa, what's this?

1243
01:03:30,654 --> 01:03:32,054
So Craig should be backstage

1244
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:34,155
but he apparently has sent me a
message and it looks important.

1245
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:35,557
So if you don't mind I'm
going to play it back.

1246
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:38,328
And I can play it back in line
even with a video message here.

1247
01:03:38,328 --> 01:03:42,668
Jos, we got a serious
situation developing back here.

Bryan, you got
to do something.

01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:51,077

you to buy some more time.

&gt; Needless to say, hair
like that doesn't come easy.

1255
01:04:04,554 --> 01:04:07,294
So while he's dealing with
his crisis backstage--

1256
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,660
oh look, I've actually got
an audio message from him.

1257
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,859

is I can actually listen

1258
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,861
to audio messages and reply to
them from the lock screen simply

1259

Hey Jos, we got the
crisis contained back here.

I'm good to go, so wrap it
up whenever you're ready.

listen to a message.

that you survived the
great hair crisis of 2014.

OK. So next up, iCloud Drive.

1278
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:12,292
So, of course, iCloud
documents work great

1279
01:05:12,288 --> 01:05:16,528
across a single app
on your iOS devices.

1280
01:05:16,526 --> 01:05:20,326
But now, with iCloud Drive,
you also have a great way

1281
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,900
to work across applications.

1282
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:26,999
So say you're in an app here
like Sketchbook, you can bring

1283
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:31,073
up your iCloud Drive panel
and open documents directly

1284
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:32,374
from other applications

1285
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:35,245
like a compatible document
inside of GoodReader.

1286
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:38,745
And when you open it up in that
document, in that application

1287
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:41,788
and edit it, those edits
are saved right back

1288
01:05:41,785 --> 01:05:43,085
to their original locations.

1289
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,486

1290
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:47,127
of these different
versions and copy problems.

1291
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:50,693
Now, of course, you also have
access to all of those documents

1292
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:53,833
on your Mac and on
Windows as well.

1294
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:59,098
Next up, something you weren't
expecting from me, Enterprise.

1295
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:02,202
Now it turns out that iOS--

1296
01:06:02,205 --> 01:06:05,375
yeah, they got one Enterprise
guy over there, I know.

1297
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:07,915
So iOS is a huge hit
in the Enterprise.

1298
01:06:07,911 --> 01:06:12,611
In fact, 98 percent of
the Fortune 500 uses iOS.

1299

And we're going to
get the last two.

1300
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:19,218
And it's in part
because of these great

1301
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:22,422
iOS-tailored applications.

1302
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:27,565

amazing array of technologies,

applied to all of us

privacy and security

Now, one of them
that we just released

1308
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:43,949
in the last few months I think
is emblematic of our philosophy

1309
01:06:43,947 --> 01:06:47,517
of the Enterprise, and that's
the Device Enrollment Program.

1310
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:49,817
Now traditionally, if you
go to work at a company

1311
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:51,919
and they want you to give you
a device, they actually have

1312
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:55,121
to take the device they give
you, rip it out of its box,

1313
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:58,265
connect it to some PC,
image it with software

1314
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:00,431
to configure, it's a big pain.

1315
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,670
But now with the Device
Enrollment Program,

1316
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:05,065
you can actually get
your iPad or iPhone

1317
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:07,308
in its original shrink wrap box.

1318
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:11,343
And when you open it up, it'll
automatically configure itself

1319
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:13,781
for your Enterprise,
setting up all of your mail

1320
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:16,146
and getting your mail
messages, automatically setting

1321
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:19,446
up your calendar, and even
downloading all your Enterprise

1322
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,989
apps, it's that simple.

continue our focus on security,

1325
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:31,125
iOS 8 has expanded
data protection.

01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:33,097
So you get passcode protection

1327
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:36,636
of all the major data types
including third-party apps.

feature I think we're all going

01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:43,871
to like called VIP threads.

So now, there's a thread
you're on or message you send,

1332
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,179
and you want to get notified

1333
01:07:48,178 --> 01:07:50,648
on the lock screen whenever
there's a reply on that thread,

So, we also extend
our management

1344
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,581
to include managed
books and PDFs,

1345

valuable for education.

01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,620
Now, something that we all
care a lot about, Health.

1348
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:33,521
Whoa.

[ Applause ]

1350
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:42,402
So, developers have created a
vast array of healthcare devices

1351
01:08:42,398 --> 01:08:44,238
and accompanying applications,

1352
01:08:44,234 --> 01:08:47,274
everything from monitoring
your activity level,

1353
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:50,240
to your heart rate,
to your weight,

1354
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,280
and chronic medical conditions
like high blood pressure

1355
01:08:53,276 --> 01:08:57,176
and diabetes, but up to now
the information gathered

1356
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,380
by those applications
lives in silos.

1357
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:03,623
You can't get a single
comprehensive picture

1358
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,620
of your health situation.

1359
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:08,862
But now you can with HealthKit.

1360
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:11,558
HealthKit provides
a single place

1361
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:14,661
that applications can contribute
to a composite profile

1362
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:17,364
of your activity and health.

1363
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:18,767
And HealthKit comes

1364
01:09:18,768 --> 01:09:21,468
with a corresponding
application, Health.

1365
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:26,481
And with Health, you can
monitor all of your metrics

1366
01:09:26,476 --> 01:09:29,446
that you're most
interested in your activity.

1367
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:33,215
But not just that, you can
use third-party applications.

1368
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:35,216
Now we carefully
protect your privacy

1369
01:09:35,218 --> 01:09:38,188
so you have total control over
which applications have access

1370
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:41,157
to which part of your
healthcare information.

1371
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:44,257
But you can for instance provide
different activity, weight,

1372
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,560
heart rate information
to the Nike app.

1373
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:49,933
And Nike is working to
integrate HealthKit,

1374
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:52,372
so they use that information
to help you in your pursuit

1375
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:55,008
of your personalized
fitness goals.

1376

Now, we're also working
with the Mayo Clinic,

innovators in healthcare.

1378
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:03,343
And with their integration
with HealthKit, they're going

1379
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:07,946
to be able that when a patient
takes let's say a blood pressure

1380
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:11,350
reading, HealthKit
automatically notifies their app

1381
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:13,854
and their app is automatically
able to check whether

1382
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:16,496
that reading is within
that patient's personalized

1383
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:18,762
healthcare parameters
and thresholds.

1384
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:22,161
And if not, it can contact
the hospital proactively,

1385
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:25,065
notify a doctor and that
doctor can reach back

1386
01:10:25,068 --> 01:10:28,938
to that patient providing
more timely care.

1387
01:10:28,938 --> 01:10:30,578

1389
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:39,378
Now we think this is going to be
really important for healthcare

1390
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:42,122
and the CEO of the
Mayo Clinic agrees.

1391
01:10:42,118 --> 01:10:44,588
He says that, "We believe
Apple's HealthKit will

1392
01:10:44,587 --> 01:10:47,087
revolutionize the
health industry--

1393
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,330
how the health industry
interacts with people.

1394
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:50,665
We're proud to be
at the forefront

1395
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:54,430
of this innovative technology
with the Mayo Clinic app."

1396
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:57,630
We agree. Now we're also
working with leaders

1397
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:00,273
in healthcare applications
like Epic systems.

1398
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:05,309
Now they provide the technology
that enables hospitals serving

1399
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:07,508
over 100 million Americans.

1400

And so now with their
integration with HealthKit,

1401

institutions will be able

1402
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:16,583
to get closer in
sharing their information

01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:35,868
It's the easy way to
share what's important.

1407
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:38,172
Now when I was a kid,

1408
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:41,114
the refrigerator was the
center of family sharing.

1409

Our refrigerator looked just

1410
01:11:42,378 --> 01:11:44,918
like this except the
kid who had gray hair.

1411

that easy to set up your family

1412

on their iOS devices and once
you've set up your family

1413
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:57,594
as a family unit,
you automatically get

1414
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:01,863
to share photos with the shared
photo stream, to share calendars

1415
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,064
with your family, to
share reminder list

configure things

is in the form of songs

you for permission.

to all of your photos for your

1448
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:02,121
but your device actually
has access to more photos

1449
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:05,218
in the cloud than it can
physically store locally

so you can get them
all wherever you are.

Now of course, if you
have these many photos,

1452
01:14:12,628 --> 01:14:17,838
you want great search and
so we now on iOS 8 Photos,

1453
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:20,673
we give you great search
suggestions for instance

1454
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:25,110
of locations, photos taken
near where you are right now,

photos taken a year ago today,
photos taken in your home,

but we also give you search.

1457

match on things like location,

that you've set up.

So here I am in my large
cloud photo collection,

1468
01:15:14,757 --> 01:15:18,457
and I have great search here,
so I have all my suggestion

1469
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:21,601
but I can also start typing
and you notice I get matches

1470
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:23,867
on location and time period.

1471
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:26,506
But also an album, so here
I have beach day with Mandy.

1472
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,672
And I can tap right in there,

1473
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:32,071
look through these nice
photos, let's take a look.

1474
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:33,974
Those are some good ones.

1475
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:37,816
Now that's a photo that
I think has potential

1476
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:40,713
but it's really quite dark
and kind of washed out.

1477
01:15:40,716 --> 01:15:42,956
Unfortunately, we have these
great smart editing controls

1478
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:45,752
that I can use to fix it up, so
I'm going to bring up our levels

1479
01:15:45,755 --> 01:15:47,955
and you also have levels
for light and color

1480
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:48,787
down there at the bottom.

1481
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:49,821
I'm going tap on light,

1482
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:53,225
and I get this great
smart light meter.

1483
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:56,529
Now I can just drag this across
like this and it lightens

1484
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:58,832
up the photo really nicely,

1485
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:00,974
so I dial that in
just the way I want.

1486
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:04,070
But what's happening under
the hood is really amazing.

1487
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,873
You notice that to achieve
the lightning effect,

1488
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:10,176
it brought brightness
and contrast up, exposure

1489
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:12,819
and highlights down
and shadows up based

1490
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:16,055
on detailed image analysis of
what would achieve that effect.

1491
01:16:16,052 --> 01:16:18,252
Now I could go in and
I could manually try

1492
01:16:18,254 --> 01:16:21,254
to tweak those parameters like
have that level of control

1493
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:23,857
but I don't need to because
it does such a great job

1494
01:16:23,859 --> 01:16:27,859
and I also have that control
for color, so I can just drive

1495
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:31,963
up the color for instance, bring
out the sky and the skin tones

1496
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:33,837
and I look at the difference
of what we've been able

01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:39,546
to achieve before, after,
it's really awesome.

that right now in favorites,
I don't have that picture

1506

made those nice edits,

01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:21,756
Now we have those same editing
controls tailored for iPad,

1513
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:24,521
so I'm going to go in to
do a crop and do a kind

1514
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,460
of extreme close up crop
here like this, hit done

1515
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:33,198
and of course these changes
are going to go up live

1516
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:37,535
to my iPad photo library and
it go right across to my phone.

[ Applause ]

1518
01:17:42,772 --> 01:17:45,772
So of course you may be
wondering what about the Mac?

1519
01:17:45,775 --> 01:17:49,675
Well good news, we are
working on a new grounds

1520
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:54,348
up photo solution for the Mac
built with iCloud in mind,

1521
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:57,050
and that's going to be
shipping early next year but I'd

1522
01:17:57,052 --> 01:17:58,992
like to give you
a sneak peek now.

1523
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:01,528
All right.

1524
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:07,528
So let's take a look
at photos on the Mac.

1525
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:13,940
As you see, I get beautiful
buttery scrolling here.

1526
01:18:13,936 --> 01:18:18,136
I have my moments right here,
I can pinch out if I want

1527
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:24,110
from moments to collections
and all the way out to years.

1528
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:28,653
I can scrub through my photos
like this even in year view.

1529
01:18:28,651 --> 01:18:32,951
If I find a photo I like,
just let go and zoom right in.

1530
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:37,225
You watch as I magnify
this photo, the interplay

1531
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:40,126
with the title bar,
it's really gorgeous.

1532
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:45,239
I'm going to go ahead and browse
through these a little bit.

1533
01:18:47,136 --> 01:18:49,306
Now here's a photo
that looks really

1534
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:50,405
like it's got some potential

1535
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:53,106
but it could use
some brightening up,

1536
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,748
can have the same
kinds of adjustments.

1537
01:18:55,744 --> 01:18:57,984
You notice here at this
light and color meters, well,

1538
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,980
I can just close this control,
so we can watch what happens

1539
01:19:00,983 --> 01:19:04,383
in real time as I make
the lighting adjustment.

1540
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:06,656
And notice how some of these
are going up and some are going

1541
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:10,825
down to create this
effect, it's really great.

1542
01:19:10,826 --> 01:19:15,566
I can do the same with color,
let's just boost the color,

1543
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:21,104
bring out the sky, bring out the
skin tones, and it's that easy,

01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:25,143
the new photos app, to really
create beautiful images.

1545
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,680
And that's a quick preview
of photos coming to Yosemite

1546
01:19:28,677 --> 01:19:31,977
in the future and to
the new photo solution

with your Mac and via
the web, Windows as well.

1552
01:19:54,603 --> 01:19:58,403
Now this is all your
photos and also your videos.

1553
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:00,577
And these are in
their original format

1554
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:03,376
and their full resolution.

1555
01:20:03,379 --> 01:20:05,649
Now this uses your
iCloud storage,

1556
01:20:05,648 --> 01:20:08,088
so your first 5 gigs are free.

1557

safely up in the cloud.

1563
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:35,079
So, a great set of major
features coming to iOS.

1564
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:38,477
But of course, there's
always a whole lot more

1565
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,620
than I have time
to talk about here.

1566
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:44,956
I do want to hit on just two
more quickly, and one is Siri.

1567
01:20:44,954 --> 01:20:48,824
Now, we have-- if you take
your phone and you plug it

1568
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:51,724
in for instance in the car,
you can say, "Hey Siri,"

1569
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:54,027
and start talking to
Siri without having

1570
01:20:54,029 --> 01:20:55,999
to even touch your phone.

1571
01:20:55,998 --> 01:20:58,698
And we have song
recognition with Shazam.

1572
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,441
So now, if you just start up
Siri and there's a song playing

1573
01:21:01,437 --> 01:21:03,507
around you, it will
tell you what it is

1574
01:21:03,505 --> 01:21:07,445
and you can even purchase it
right there from within Siri.

1575
01:21:07,443 --> 01:21:10,443
Siri also now supports
streaming voice recognition.

1576
01:21:10,446 --> 01:21:12,586
So as you talk, you can
see what it's recognizing.

1577
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:15,621
It's more responsive than
ever, and we have support

1578
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:19,687
for 22 new dictation languages.

1579
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:23,728
Finally, in China we now
have greatly improved maps

1580
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:27,826
with vector based maps and
turn by turn directions.

1581
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:30,930
We also have support for
lunar calendar which is great

1582
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,003
for holidays and birthdays.

1583
01:21:33,002 --> 01:21:38,672

input and improved weather data.

half of the story,

ended the keynote now it would

01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:10,940
be a giant release.

1594

But there is a lot more.

1595
01:22:13,509 --> 01:22:18,419
The second part of the
story is what iOS 8 provides

1596
01:22:18,414 --> 01:22:20,214
for developers.

make even more incredible apps

not create before.

delivered via the App Store.

million of your apps on it.

This is a phenomenal number.

1602

And the marketplace around these
apps is unbelievably vibrant,

the App Store every week.

browsing, they are downloading.

They've now downloaded
over 75 billion apps.

These are mind blowing numbers.

Now, what we want to do is
make the App Store even better.

1608
01:23:13,802 --> 01:23:16,872
And so, we're rolling out
a number of new features

1609
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:23,942
on the store, starting with
we're adding an Explore tab

they're looking for more.

categories and subcategories.

trending searches

your search even better

by making it faster by adding
a continuous scrolling list.

searches to make it easier

app you're looking for.

And for those of you
that are not developers,

1647
01:25:41,984 --> 01:25:45,284
the SDK is a Software
Development Kit

make all of the amazing apps.

This release is the
biggest release

since the launch
of the App Store.

the capabilities and tools

to make things that
you haven't dreamed of

whole new level.

team has done just an unreal job

Now, I want to start
with something

that I think is perhaps
most profound

01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:46,185
and that's Extensibility.

So with Extensibility,
applications

1665
01:26:48,617 --> 01:26:52,487

able to extend the system

1666

to other apps.

own data but can't get

01:27:22,818 --> 01:27:26,618
Well, the handle
Extensibility in an iOS way,

1676
01:27:26,621 --> 01:27:29,591
we wanted to build on the
same sandboxing model.

1677
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:33,431
So now extensions live inside
an application's own sandbox

1678
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:36,868
with access to its own data,
but other applications can reach

1679
01:27:36,865 --> 01:27:40,835
out by way of iOS'
security mechanisms,

1680
01:27:40,836 --> 01:27:41,966
talk to that extension.

1681
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:44,770
That extension can even
project UI right back

1682
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:46,573
in to the originating app.

1683
01:27:46,575 --> 01:27:48,815
Now this enables
some great things.

1684
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,180
For instance, in addition

1685
01:27:50,178 --> 01:27:52,648
to the systems built-in
sharing options,

1686
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:57,257
an app like Pinterest can
offer share sheet to Safari.

1687
01:27:57,252 --> 01:28:00,452
And if you look at
actions, for instance,

1688
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:04,325
an app like Bing could offer
translation right inside

1689
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:10,266
of Safari accessing the web
pages web content right there.

1690
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:14,605
Now we're also supporting photo
filters inside the photos,

1691
01:28:14,603 --> 01:28:16,303
and enabling third parties

1692
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:19,204
to define their own
document providers that work

1693
01:28:19,207 --> 01:28:23,147
within the iCloud
drive-enabled application.

1694
01:28:23,145 --> 01:28:28,285
Finally, we're enabling third
party apps to define widgets

1695
01:28:28,283 --> 01:28:31,523
that can now go in
Notification Center.

[ Applause ]

1697
01:28:37,225 --> 01:28:42,365
I think it feels
like time for a demo.

1698
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:45,864
So let's start with
photo filters.

1699
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:47,407
So, we're back here in photos

1700
01:28:47,402 --> 01:28:51,042
and I've got a nice
photo here of a flower.

1701
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,909
And I'm going to go ahead and
edit and you notice an addition

1702
01:28:53,909 --> 01:28:56,309
to the options here at
the bottom of the screen,

1703
01:28:56,311 --> 01:28:59,111
we have at the top left
this extensions button.

1704
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:01,514
I'm going to click
that, tap that rather.

1705
01:29:01,516 --> 01:29:04,216
And you notice I have
several extensions available,

1706
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:06,719
one from VSCO Cam and
one from Waterlogue.

1707
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:08,491
I'm going to select Waterlogue.

1708
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:11,530
And now the Waterlogue extension
is able to run right here

1709
01:29:11,526 --> 01:29:15,126
in the context of photos to
manipulate my photo bringing

1710
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:21,270
up their own UI, deliver this
beautiful water color effect

1711
01:29:21,269 --> 01:29:26,139
to my photo, and when I'm
done, it's right back inside

1712
01:29:26,141 --> 01:29:28,511
of my photo album,
it's that easy.

[ Applause ]

1714
01:29:34,349 --> 01:29:36,019
Then next let's take
a look at widgets.

1715
01:29:36,017 --> 01:29:39,057
So I'm going to just pull
down Notification Center.

1716
01:29:39,054 --> 01:29:42,554
I have my existing widgets
here in my Today view.

1717
01:29:42,557 --> 01:29:45,127
Did you notice an addition
to my widget is down here

1718
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:47,166
at the bottom it says
"One New Widget Available"

1719
01:29:47,162 --> 01:29:48,962
because I've downloaded
an app recently

1720
01:29:48,964 --> 01:29:51,704
that contains a Notification
Center widget.

1721
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:52,600
So I'm going to tap Edit.

1722
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,701
And you notice its SportsCenter.

1723
01:29:54,703 --> 01:29:57,203
So I can tap the plus
next to SportsCenter,

1724
01:29:57,205 --> 01:30:00,945
position it where I want, I'm
on my widgets in my Today view.

1725
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,142
Tap Done, and now
I have information

1726
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:06,584
on my favorite sports
teams right here inside

1727
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:08,351
of Notification Center.

1728
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:11,190
Now this works great
on iPad as well.

1729
01:30:11,186 --> 01:30:14,026
Let's take a look at iPad.

1730
01:30:14,022 --> 01:30:17,192
So iPad, I'm going to bring
down Notification Center.

1731
01:30:17,192 --> 01:30:20,692
And you notice I have this
interactive widget from eBay.

1732
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:26,105
So, I'm bidding on a guitar and
apparently I'm being outbid.

1733
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:28,441
So I can now write inside of
notification, take advantage

1734
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:30,136
of the interactivity widgets.

1735
01:30:30,138 --> 01:30:34,108
I can tap and bid
and just like this,

1736
01:30:34,109 --> 01:30:39,279
I can submit a leading bid all
inside of Notification Center.

1737
01:30:39,281 --> 01:30:42,021
Now to wrap it up, I want to
show you extensions in Safari.

1738
01:30:42,017 --> 01:30:44,117
I'm going to bring up Safari.

1739
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:45,559
Use our great new tab view.

1740
01:30:45,554 --> 01:30:49,194
It's a page I've been looking
at here with some information

1741
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:52,590
on a beautiful guitar and I'd
like to learn more about it but,

1742
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:56,034
unfortunately, you notice
the text here is in Japanese

1743
01:30:56,031 --> 01:30:58,271
and I do not read Japanese.

1744
01:30:58,266 --> 01:31:01,136
Fortunately, I have a Bing
translation extension,

1745
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:05,376
so I can just bring
up my action sheet.

1746
01:31:05,373 --> 01:31:07,873
And you notice down here in
the second row, Bing translate,

1747
01:31:07,876 --> 01:31:10,576
I'm going to tap on
that and Bing is able

1748
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:14,319
to translate this web
page right in line.

1749
01:31:14,316 --> 01:31:15,546
Look at that.

Now for our extension's
grand finale,

1752
01:31:24,459 --> 01:31:27,459
let's put that on
my Pinterest board.

1753
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:29,332
You see Pinterest has
an extension right here.

1754
01:31:29,331 --> 01:31:32,771
I'm going to tap on that and
this is actually able to bring

1755
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:35,837
up a UI defined by Pinterest
where I can select my board,

1756
01:31:35,837 --> 01:31:37,207
maybe select my guitar's board.

1757
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:39,405
Now the Pinterest
extension is accessed

1758
01:31:39,407 --> 01:31:41,977
to the underlying
web page, so I can--

1759
01:31:41,977 --> 01:31:43,817
let me slide through
the different photos

1760
01:31:43,812 --> 01:31:46,552
on the page till I find
the one I want to share.

1761
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:47,518
That's it.

1762
01:31:47,515 --> 01:31:49,715

1765
01:32:00,462 --> 01:32:03,832
Now there's one important kind
of extension that I did fail

1766
01:32:03,832 --> 01:32:06,002
to mention and that's
the ability

1767
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:10,541
to install system-wide
third party keyboards.

1769
01:32:16,444 --> 01:32:18,684
So now if you have special
keyboard you want to use,

1770
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,420
you can install those in iOS.

1771
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:23,355
And by default, those
of course run inside

1772
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:26,651
of the most restrictive
sandbox with no network access

because we want to make sure
to protect your privacy.

But if that keyboard requires
or you want to grant it ability,

1775
01:32:33,128 --> 01:32:35,798
it can ask for access
to the network

1776
01:32:35,797 --> 01:32:38,167

functionality.

of Touch ID as well.

fingerprint matches

But, you know, each of them
have their own application

1819

their own network protocol,

some rationality to the space.

with a common network protocol

that has secure pairing
to ensure

And in addition to being able
to control individual devices

can group devices and changes

for bed," and be assured

01:36:02,637 --> 01:36:05,507
In addition to the writing in
the client side using Xcode

1842
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:06,846
and our frameworks, you have

1843
01:36:06,841 --> 01:36:08,211
to write the server
side of the app.

1844
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:11,809
You have to write server side
app logic, you have to deal

1845
01:36:11,813 --> 01:36:14,653
with authentication, asset
storage, database storage,

1846
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:17,019
search, even push
notifications and then you got

1847
01:36:17,018 --> 01:36:19,288
to pay somebody to host it all.

1848
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:23,087
Well, now, with CloudKit,
CloudKit takes

1849
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:25,761
over the cloud part
and provide you

1850
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,360
with a client side
programming model

1851
01:36:28,363 --> 01:36:32,563
that lets you access iCloud
authentication storage,

1852
01:36:32,567 --> 01:36:34,537
search and more.

1853
01:36:34,535 --> 01:36:36,875
And when it comes to paying,

1854
01:36:36,871 --> 01:36:45,751
CloudKit is effectively
free, with limits.

1855
01:36:45,747 --> 01:36:49,647
So, CloudKit scales the
data allocated to your app

1856
01:36:49,651 --> 01:36:53,291
and bandwidth based on the
number of users using your app.

1857
01:36:53,288 --> 01:36:56,958
And this goes all the way up
to granting you free a petabyte

1858
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:59,428
of assets, 10 terabytes
of database

1859
01:36:59,427 --> 01:37:02,927
and all the bandwidth you
can constructively use.

1860
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:05,501
That is CloudKit.

1861
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:13,440
[ Applause ]

1862
01:37:13,441 --> 01:37:16,711
Next, I want to move on to
something huge in the area

1863
01:37:16,711 --> 01:37:23,021
of 3D graphics, and
it's called Metal, so--

1864
01:37:23,017 --> 01:37:24,887
[ Laughter ]

1865
01:37:24,886 --> 01:37:29,356
As you know, OpenGL is
the standards based way

1866
01:37:29,357 --> 01:37:33,497
for high performance 3D graphics
on iOS, giving you access

1867
01:37:33,494 --> 01:37:37,034
to the power of the
A7 processor.

1868
01:37:37,031 --> 01:37:39,501
But increasingly, if you look at
what goes on in the performance

1869
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,470
of the game, in addition to what
the game wants to accomplish,

1870
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:46,470
OpenGL ends up being a
thick layer of overhead

1871
01:37:46,474 --> 01:37:49,774
between the game
and the hardware.

1872
01:37:49,777 --> 01:37:51,417
Well, now, we have Metal.

1873
01:37:51,412 --> 01:37:54,012
And Metal dramatically reduces

1874
01:37:54,015 --> 01:37:56,685
that overhead giving
the game near bare

1875
01:37:56,684 --> 01:37:59,984
to the metal access
to the power of A7.

1876
01:37:59,988 --> 01:38:05,728
The results are stunning up
to 10x faster draw call rates.

1877
01:38:05,727 --> 01:38:11,467
Now, in addition to these
dramatically reduced overheads,

1878
01:38:11,466 --> 01:38:13,236
you get access not
just to graphics

1879
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:16,204
but to the compute
power of the GPU,

1880
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:18,544
and Metal supports
pre-compiled shaders

1881
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:19,939
and efficient multithreading

1882
01:38:19,941 --> 01:38:23,111
so you can always get the
most out of the processor.

1883
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:26,511
Now, we've been working
with the leading providers

1884
01:38:26,514 --> 01:38:30,654
of gaming engines
on mobile platforms

1885
01:38:30,651 --> 01:38:33,151
and what they've been able
to accomplish with Metal

1886
01:38:33,154 --> 01:38:37,194
in just a few weeks
is truly stunning.

1887
01:38:37,191 --> 01:38:39,961
Let's start with EA and the
work they've done taking their

1888
01:38:39,961 --> 01:38:47,501
console level title Plants vs.
Zombies and bringing it to iOS.

1889
01:38:47,502 --> 01:38:52,242
They're able to put over 1.3
million triangles on the screen

1890
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,480
at a time and do depth
of motion, effects,

1891
01:38:55,476 --> 01:38:58,716
depth of field effects that they
could never imagine achieving.

1892
01:38:58,713 --> 01:39:02,153
In fact, they're using their
Frostbyte console engine

1893
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:05,920
that they thought could never
come to mobile and now it can.

1894
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,520
And let's look at Crytek.

1895
01:39:08,523 --> 01:39:13,733
Crytek was able to bring their
console-level geom cache to iOS

1896
01:39:13,728 --> 01:39:14,858
and they were able to get

1897
01:39:14,862 --> 01:39:18,532
up to 4000 draw calls
per frame going here.

1898
01:39:18,533 --> 01:39:20,473
This is up to 10x, the kind

1899
01:39:20,468 --> 01:39:23,708
of performance they
were seeing previously.

1900
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:29,274
Now, to show you live what
can be done with Metal,

1901
01:39:29,277 --> 01:39:32,347
I'd like to bring up the
founder of Epic Games

1902
01:39:32,346 --> 01:39:34,716
to the stage, Tim Sweeney.

1903
01:39:34,715 --> 01:39:37,515
Tim, come on up.

1904
01:39:37,518 --> 01:39:44,688
[ Applause ]

1905
01:39:44,692 --> 01:39:46,262
Thank you.

1906
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:48,460
We've had the opportunity
to work with Metal

1907
01:39:48,463 --> 01:39:50,303
and to illustrate some
of the possibilities,

1908
01:39:50,298 --> 01:39:52,638
we created a Zen Garden.

1909
01:39:52,633 --> 01:39:56,333
Now this environment was built

1910
01:39:56,337 --> 01:39:58,677
in Unreal Engine 4
on a high-end Mac.

1911
01:39:58,673 --> 01:40:02,543
And now thanks to Metal, we're
running it on iPad in Realtime

1912
01:40:02,543 --> 01:40:05,483
with full fidelity
and performance.

1913
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,550
Metal's efficiency enable us
an order of magnitude increase

1914
01:40:08,549 --> 01:40:11,489
in detail making it possible
for developers like us

1915
01:40:11,486 --> 01:40:13,626
to create a new generation
of vivid

1916
01:40:13,621 --> 01:40:16,191
and interactive 3D experiences.

1917
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:18,160
Now Josh Adams is the
programmer who wrote much

1918
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:19,529
of the code that's running.

1919
01:40:19,527 --> 01:40:21,497
Josh, can you explain
what we're seeing here?

1920
01:40:21,496 --> 01:40:22,866
Yeah, sure.

1921
01:40:22,864 --> 01:40:25,634
First of all thanks to Metal
support for precompiled shaders,

1922
01:40:25,633 --> 01:40:27,173
we can have a huge
variety of materials

1923
01:40:27,168 --> 01:40:28,368
without a load time impact.

1924
01:40:28,369 --> 01:40:31,669
And our first stop we'll
check out this cherry tree

1925
01:40:31,672 --> 01:40:34,072
where I can drag on the
screen to paint the petals

1926
01:40:34,075 --> 01:40:36,775
on to the tree and they
start falling to the ground.

1927
01:40:36,777 --> 01:40:40,217
There are about 5,000 petals
here being physically simulated

1928
01:40:40,214 --> 01:40:41,984
and I can interact with them
by touching on the screen

1929
01:40:41,983 --> 01:40:43,113
to blow wind through the area.

1930
01:40:43,117 --> 01:40:48,927
All right, next up we
have a Koi pond filled

1931
01:40:48,923 --> 01:40:50,563
with hundreds of fish.

1932
01:40:50,558 --> 01:40:53,258
Metal has freed up enough
CPU time and we can have each

1933
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:55,131
of them running their own
artificial intelligence

1934
01:40:55,129 --> 01:40:56,929
which you can see here as
I drag around the water.

1935
01:40:56,931 --> 01:40:59,831
And there's a few more fish
here than a real Koi pond

1936
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:02,334
but since Metal lets us
do it, we figured why not.

1937
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:06,404
And of course every Zen garden
needs some sand to rake.

1938
01:41:06,407 --> 01:41:09,407
So I go over here I can
rake any pattern I want

1939
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:11,180
into the sand here.

1940
01:41:11,179 --> 01:41:13,679
Now artist love that they
can make an effect like this

1941
01:41:13,681 --> 01:41:15,251
without needing a
programmer like me to make

1942
01:41:15,249 --> 01:41:17,589
that one-off effect for
a drop core reduction

1943
01:41:17,585 --> 01:41:19,625
or other optimizations.

1944
01:41:22,823 --> 01:41:25,323
And for our final
moment of Zen walk

1945
01:41:25,326 --> 01:41:27,066
over to this water fountain.

1946
01:41:28,429 --> 01:41:32,229
Now I can tap on it, pour out
some water which then turns

1947
01:41:32,233 --> 01:41:34,173
to a couple hundred butterflies

1948
01:41:34,168 --> 01:41:36,608
but of course not
going to stop there.

1949
01:41:36,604 --> 01:41:38,604
So I can touch the screen
to call more of them to me

1950
01:41:38,606 --> 01:41:39,736
and then guide them
around the area.

1951
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:43,740
So there are about 3,500
individually animated

1952
01:41:43,744 --> 01:41:45,144
and rendered butterfly
meshes here.

1953
01:41:45,146 --> 01:41:47,716
Now I had to keep telling the
artist to turn the numbers up

1954
01:41:47,715 --> 01:41:50,085
and up because they do not think
it was going to be possible.

1955
01:41:50,084 --> 01:41:51,584
Pretty cool huh?

1956
01:41:51,586 --> 01:42:00,596
[ Applause ]

1957
01:42:03,931 --> 01:42:05,331
Thanks.

1958
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,173
There are thousands of objects
being rendered here and it seem

1959
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:09,368
that we couldn't have
dreamed of building prior

1960
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:11,670
to Metal delivering
a tenfold increase

1961
01:42:11,672 --> 01:42:12,942
in rendering efficiency.

1962
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:16,240
To have this level of
graphics capability on iPhone

1963
01:42:16,244 --> 01:42:18,914
and iPad now is a
stunning breakthrough.

1964
01:42:18,913 --> 01:42:22,953
We're proud to have been a part
of it and of course we'd love

1965
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,190
to share this with you.

1966
01:42:24,185 --> 01:42:26,625
So as soon as iOS 8 is
available we will be making

1967
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:29,891
that Zen garden available
in the app store for free.

1968
01:42:29,890 --> 01:42:31,560

Its amazing and that was--
it's easy to forget on an iPad.

1971
01:42:45,273 --> 01:42:47,373
Its incredible graphics
they were able to achieve

1972
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:49,615
and I think we are all
feeling very Zen now.

1973
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:50,850
So that's very good.

1974
01:42:50,845 --> 01:42:52,045
So that's Metal.

1975
01:42:52,046 --> 01:42:55,286
Now I want to move
from high-end 3D gaming

1976
01:42:55,283 --> 01:42:58,223
to casual gaming in Sprite Kit.

1977
01:42:58,219 --> 01:43:00,489
We introduced Sprite
Kit last year at WWDC.

1978
01:43:00,488 --> 01:43:02,888
And it's been a big hit

1979
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:06,190
with people building casual
games on the app store.

1980
01:43:06,193 --> 01:43:09,133
And now this year we've
really enhanced Sprite Kit

1981
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:11,370
with some things that make
your casual games just

1982
01:43:11,365 --> 01:43:12,765
that much more fun.

1983
01:43:12,767 --> 01:43:16,737
We have support for light
sources, field forces,

1984
01:43:16,737 --> 01:43:19,337
per-pixel physics that
actually allow your objects

1985
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:22,040
to automatically interact
with proper physics based

1986
01:43:22,043 --> 01:43:26,383
on their drawn shapes and
even inverse kinematics.

1987
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,920
And now also this year
for the first time

1988
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:33,556
on iOS we're bringing SceneKit.

1989
01:43:33,554 --> 01:43:37,054
[ Applause ]

1990
01:43:37,058 --> 01:43:39,758
Now SceneKit is a
3D scene renderer

1991
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,560
and now it's been enhanced
as designed for casual games

1992
01:43:42,563 --> 01:43:45,763
with an integrated physics
engine, particle systems

1993
01:43:45,766 --> 01:43:48,506
and support for scripted
actions.

1994
01:43:48,502 --> 01:43:52,772
So these are two great solutions
for casual games on iOS.

1995
01:43:52,773 --> 01:43:56,573
Next, Xcode--

[ Applause ]

1997
01:43:59,213 --> 01:44:02,183
Now Xcode is the tool set we use

1998
01:44:02,183 --> 01:44:06,683
to build all applications
for the Mac and iOS.

1999
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:08,187
And Xcode is in fact one

2000
01:44:08,189 --> 01:44:11,659
of the most popular
pro-apps on our platform.

2001
01:44:11,659 --> 01:44:16,829
The last version was
downloaded 14 million times.

2002
01:44:16,831 --> 01:44:18,471
It's unbelievable.

2003
01:44:18,466 --> 01:44:22,806
Now of course central to
Xcode is the language we use

2004
01:44:22,803 --> 01:44:26,503
to develop our apps,
Objective-C.

2005
01:44:26,507 --> 01:44:30,977
Now Objective-C has served
us so well for 20 years.

2006
01:44:30,978 --> 01:44:32,348
We absolutely love it.

2007
01:44:32,346 --> 01:44:35,646
But we had to ask ourselves
the question what would it be

2008
01:44:35,649 --> 01:44:41,559
like if we had Objective-C
without the baggage of C?

2009
01:44:41,555 --> 01:44:44,155
[ Laughter ]

2010
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:47,998
Well we did more
than think about it.

2011
01:44:47,995 --> 01:44:50,565
We have a new programming
language.

2012

[ Applause ]

2013
01:45:01,008 --> 01:45:06,148
The language is called Swift
and it totally rules [laughter].

2014
01:45:06,147 --> 01:45:07,847
Swift is fast.

2015
01:45:07,848 --> 01:45:09,148
It is modern.

2016
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:10,650
It is designed for safety.

2017
01:45:10,651 --> 01:45:13,291
And it enables the level of
interactivity and development

2018
01:45:13,287 --> 01:45:15,927
that you've never
seen on the platform.

2019
01:45:15,923 --> 01:45:19,893
When it comes to
speed, Swift is great.

2020
01:45:19,894 --> 01:45:21,934
Compare Python a popular
scripting language

2021
01:45:21,929 --> 01:45:23,829
with Objective-C, when it
comes to something like,

2022
01:45:23,831 --> 01:45:25,701
let's say complex object sort.

2023
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:28,539
Objective-C is a lot faster.

2024
01:45:28,536 --> 01:45:30,736
But Swift is faster still.

2025
01:45:30,738 --> 01:45:33,878
And take something like
RC4 encryption extremely

2026
01:45:33,874 --> 01:45:36,874
computationally intensive.

2027
01:45:36,877 --> 01:45:40,117
Python gets utterly crushed
in this particular benchmark.

2028
01:45:40,114 --> 01:45:44,654
And Objective-- but
look at Swift.

2029
01:45:44,652 --> 01:45:48,192
Now Swift is also modern
with features like Closures,

2030
01:45:48,189 --> 01:45:49,559
Generics, Type inference,

2031
01:45:49,557 --> 01:45:53,557
Multiple return types,
and Namespaces.

[ Applause ]

2033
01:46:09,043 --> 01:46:10,413
You know how many
people at home are going,

2034
01:46:10,411 --> 01:46:13,011
what the heck are these
guys talking about?

2035
01:46:13,013 --> 01:46:14,783
[ Laughter ]

2036
01:46:14,782 --> 01:46:17,652
With Swift you're able to
reduce a common pattern

2037
01:46:17,651 --> 01:46:20,421
that you might see in your
Objective-C code like this.

2038
01:46:20,421 --> 01:46:24,161
And reduce it to
something as simple as this.

2039
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:27,698
And Swift defines
away large classes

2040
01:46:27,695 --> 01:46:32,395
of common programming errors
they just aren't possible.

2041
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:36,869
Now, Swift is completely native
to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

2042
01:46:36,871 --> 01:46:39,641
It's built with the
same LLVM compiler

2043
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:43,210
as Objective-C using the same
Optimizer and Autovectorizer.

2044
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,950
And it has the same ARC
memory management model.

2045
01:46:45,946 --> 01:46:48,386
And the same runtime which means

2046
01:46:48,382 --> 01:46:53,092
that your Swift code can fit
right alongside your Objective-C

2047
01:46:53,087 --> 01:46:56,557
and your C code in
the same application.

2048

[ Applause ]

2049
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:09,541
Now Swift also enables a level
dynamism and interactivity

2050
01:47:09,537 --> 01:47:11,537
in development that
we've never seen before

2051
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:14,509
for the feature we
call playgrounds.

2052
01:47:14,508 --> 01:47:17,908
To demonstrate Swift and
playgrounds in action,

2053
01:47:17,912 --> 01:47:21,452
I'd like to bring to
the stage Chris Lattner.

2054
01:47:21,448 --> 01:47:23,518
Come on up Chris.

2055
01:47:23,517 --> 01:47:29,357
[ Applause ]

2056
01:47:29,356 --> 01:47:30,556
Thank you Craig.

2057
01:47:30,558 --> 01:47:32,858
I am thrilled to be here
and to be the first person

2058
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:35,860
to give you a taste of Swift.

2059
01:47:35,863 --> 01:47:36,963
Let me show you how fun

2060
01:47:36,964 --> 01:47:40,604
and interactive it is
to write Swift code.

2061
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:45,670
This is the Swift playground,

2062
01:47:45,673 --> 01:47:49,743
as I start typing I get
an immediately response.

2063
01:47:49,743 --> 01:47:52,383
It is actually running
my code as I type it

2064
01:47:52,379 --> 01:47:59,389
and displaying the result
in the sidebar to the right.

2065
01:47:59,386 --> 01:48:01,486
Of course, Swift
user type inference

2066
01:48:01,488 --> 01:48:04,488
and has powerful string
processing capabilities

2067
01:48:04,491 --> 01:48:06,861
which make it as easy to
use as a scripting language

2068
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:10,300
without sacrificing
any performance.

2069
01:48:10,297 --> 01:48:13,137
Swift was designed from
the ground up for Cocoa

2070
01:48:13,133 --> 01:48:16,503
and Cocoa Touch, so of course
I have their full power

2071
01:48:16,503 --> 01:48:18,243
at my fingertips.

2072
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:21,408
Now, I can build
anything with Swift

2073
01:48:21,408 --> 01:48:23,848
from a social media
application all the way

2074
01:48:23,844 --> 01:48:27,844
up to a high-performance,
3D game using Metal.

2075
01:48:27,848 --> 01:48:29,448
But today to keep it simple,

2076
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:33,850
I think I'll write a
simple casual 2D game.

2077
01:48:33,854 --> 01:48:37,224
Let's start by using NSImage.

2078
01:48:37,224 --> 01:48:40,994
Let's start by using
NSImage to load a resource.

2079
01:48:40,995 --> 01:48:45,665
As you can see here, I've--

2080
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:47,806
the playground sees
I've loaded an image,

2081
01:48:47,801 --> 01:48:52,211
I can ever see it right
here from within Xcode.

2082
01:48:52,206 --> 01:48:55,576
Now, Swift is loaded with
high-end features like Generics

2083
01:48:55,576 --> 01:48:59,576
that allow me to get a lot
done with very little code.

2084
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:01,750
Here you can see I'm
using an array of strings

2085
01:49:01,749 --> 01:49:05,419
and using the functional map
algorithm to apply closure

2086
01:49:05,419 --> 01:49:08,719
to every element which allows
me to load an entire list

2087
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:13,492
of images all with the
simple line of code.

2088
01:49:13,494 --> 01:49:16,164
Now, all these resources of part
of this game that I'm working on

2089
01:49:16,163 --> 01:49:21,103
and one piece I still need to
finish up is the flight path

2090
01:49:21,101 --> 01:49:23,941
for the blimp that we have.

2091
01:49:23,937 --> 01:49:26,907
Now this is a simple loop
that computes the position

2092
01:49:26,907 --> 01:49:30,407
for the blimp overtime
as my game plays.

2093
01:49:30,411 --> 01:49:34,451
And in addition to seeing
individual values Swift

2094
01:49:34,448 --> 01:49:37,518
playgrounds even allow me to
visualize the entire history

2095
01:49:37,518 --> 01:49:41,058
of a value overtime as
my application runs.

2096
01:49:41,055 --> 01:49:42,695
And so now I can immediately see

2097
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:45,930
that this equation will
cause my blimp to slowly sink

2098
01:49:45,926 --> 01:49:48,426
as the scene plays out.

2099
01:49:48,429 --> 01:49:49,559
But I think I can do better

2100
01:49:49,563 --> 01:49:51,533
and that's not exactly
what I'm looking for.

2101
01:49:51,532 --> 01:49:56,672
So I can change the code and
I get an immediate response.

2102
01:49:56,670 --> 01:49:59,970
Simply by changing the equation
the blimp will now rise and fall

2103
01:49:59,973 --> 01:50:02,043
as the scene plays out
which is a lot more

2104
01:50:02,042 --> 01:50:04,212
of what I'm looking for.

2105
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:06,411
So, now that we have this the
way we want, we can take this

2106
01:50:06,413 --> 01:50:10,653
and copy it and let's go to
the game that I'm working on.

2107
01:50:10,651 --> 01:50:12,851
It's right here.

2108
01:50:12,853 --> 01:50:15,323
Now, this is a playground
just like before.

2109
01:50:15,322 --> 01:50:19,562
But here, I have a game in the
code written using Sprite Kit.

2110
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,830
Now, you can see our blimp
going left and right,

2111
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:24,730
straight across the scene.

2112
01:50:24,732 --> 01:50:25,962
And, I can try out
the flight path

2113
01:50:25,966 --> 01:50:29,006
that we just developed
simply by pasting it in

2114
01:50:29,002 --> 01:50:32,002
and getting the immediate
feedback I'm looking for.

2115
01:50:32,005 --> 01:50:37,345
Now, the blimp is rising and
falling just like I wanted.

2116
01:50:37,344 --> 01:50:40,814
Because Swift enables
such powerful interactive

2117
01:50:40,814 --> 01:50:43,354
and dynamic programming
experiences,

2118
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:46,990
it makes it really easy
to try out new things.

2119
01:50:46,987 --> 01:50:48,657
And, just by adding
a few lines of code,

2120
01:50:48,655 --> 01:50:53,825
I can enable Sprite Kit's per
pixel collisions, field forces

2121
01:50:53,827 --> 01:50:58,867
and lighting effects gaining a
much more interesting result.

2122
01:50:58,866 --> 01:51:02,706
Now, Swift Playgrounds even
give you full power over time.

2123
01:51:02,703 --> 01:51:07,173
And, with this timeline at
the bottom of the screen,

2124
01:51:07,174 --> 01:51:09,774
I can go forwards and backwards

2125
01:51:09,777 --> 01:51:12,377
through the execution
of my game.

2126
01:51:12,379 --> 01:51:15,119
So, I can really see
those effects in action.

2127
01:51:15,115 --> 01:51:17,255
You can see the balloons
interacting with each other

2128
01:51:17,251 --> 01:51:20,691
and with the blimp
just like that.

2129
01:51:20,687 --> 01:51:23,027
Playgrounds give me
unprecedented power

2130
01:51:23,023 --> 01:51:26,593
to see my app in detail and
give me full control when I want

2131
01:51:26,593 --> 01:51:29,763
to refine and polish
my application.

2132
01:51:29,763 --> 01:51:32,833
But, of course, Swift
works great with Xcode

2133
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:34,603
and runs great on iOS.

2134
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:38,771
So, let's now jump and see what
the finished product looks like.

2135
01:51:43,477 --> 01:51:45,577
Here we go.

2136
01:51:45,579 --> 01:51:46,979
And, this is the game
that we just built.

2137
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,850
It looks pretty great.

2138
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:52,120
Now, as Craig told you earlier,

2139
01:51:52,119 --> 01:51:55,019
we've also brought
Scene Kit to iOS.

2140
01:51:55,022 --> 01:51:56,592
With Scene Kit, it's super easy

2141
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:58,830
to build a 3D version
of our game.

2142
01:51:58,826 --> 01:52:03,666
And, that's just a quick
taste and quick look at Swift.

2143
01:52:03,664 --> 01:52:06,034

to absolutely love it.

It gives you access to all
of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

01:52:21,648 --> 01:52:24,288
So, you can build everything
from a simple example,

2151
01:52:25,719 --> 01:52:29,359
to the most powerful
applications you can imagine.

2152
01:52:29,356 --> 01:52:32,726
And Swift is going to be ready
for primetime out of the gates.

2153
01:52:32,726 --> 01:52:36,426
It comes with complete
Xcode support with indexing,

2154
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:38,630
code completion and debugging.

are available, day one,

And, you guessed it, available
to everyone else in the fall

2173
01:53:54,675 --> 01:53:57,545
and it will run on
all of these devices.

2174
01:53:57,544 --> 01:53:58,614
That is iOS 8.

2175
01:53:58,612 --> 01:54:00,512
Thank you.

2179
01:54:11,558 --> 01:54:13,898
It's an incredible
set of features

2180
01:54:13,894 --> 01:54:16,064
and an incredible release.

2181
01:54:16,063 --> 01:54:17,163
It's been a fun morning.

2182
01:54:17,164 --> 01:54:18,364
You can probably
see that from us.

2183
01:54:18,365 --> 01:54:20,165
I hope you've enjoyed
it as well.

Thank you.

2186
01:54:25,138 --> 01:54:30,478
This morning, you've seen
Yosemite, the future of OS X

2187
01:54:30,477 --> 01:54:35,647
with an incredible new
design, amazing new features

2188
01:54:35,649 --> 01:54:39,519
and engineered to work
seamlessly with iOS.

2189
01:54:39,519 --> 01:54:44,629
You've seen iOS 8, the
biggest release of iOS

2190
01:54:44,624 --> 01:54:47,524
since the introduction
of the App Store.

2191
01:54:47,527 --> 01:54:52,797
It's huge for developers and
massive for everyone else.

2192
01:54:52,799 --> 01:54:55,639
And perhaps, more importantly,

2193
01:54:55,635 --> 01:55:00,245
you've seen how our
operating systems, devices

2194
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:04,540
and services all work
together in harmony.

2195
01:55:04,544 --> 01:55:08,644
Together, they provide
an integrated

2196
01:55:08,648 --> 01:55:15,358
and continuous experience
across all of our products.

2197
01:55:15,355 --> 01:55:19,965
And, you've seen how developers
can extend their experience

2198
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,030
further than they've
ever done before

2199
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:28,270
and how they can create powerful
apps even faster and more easily

2200
01:55:28,268 --> 01:55:31,468
than they've ever been able to.

2201
01:55:33,273 --> 01:55:42,183
Apple engineers platforms,
devices and services together,

2202
01:55:42,182 --> 01:55:47,792
we do this so we can
create a seamless experience

2203
01:55:47,788 --> 01:55:55,058
for our users that is
unparalleled in the industry.

2204
01:55:55,062 --> 01:56:00,572
This is something
only Apple can do.

2205
01:56:00,567 --> 01:56:06,207
You've seen a few people
on stage this morning

2206
01:56:06,206 --> 01:56:12,676
but there are thousands of
people that made today possible.

2207
01:56:12,679 --> 01:56:15,519
And I'd like to take a
moment before we depart

2208
01:56:15,515 --> 01:56:17,115
and recognize them.

2209
01:56:17,117 --> 01:56:21,257
Would everyone from Apple stand
up that had something to do

2210
01:56:21,254 --> 01:56:24,594
with bringing today--
making today possible?

2211
01:56:24,591 --> 01:56:26,531
Stand up, don't be bashful.

01:56:46,313 --> 01:56:50,353
And, there's thousands more back
in Cupertino who were watching

2215
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:55,390
and I want to thank them, too,
and from all over the world.

2216
01:56:55,388 --> 01:57:00,128
It's a privilege of a lifetime
for me to work with all

2217
01:57:00,127 --> 01:57:02,327
of these incredible people.

2218
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:05,629
I hope everyone has
a huge conference.
