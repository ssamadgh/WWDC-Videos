    Abstract:
    This class converts PDF coordinates of a floorplan to Geographic coordinates on Earth. NOTE: This class can also be used for any "right-handed" coordinate system (other than PDF) but should not be used as-is for "Raster image" coordinates (such as PNGs or JPEGs) because those require left-handed coordinate frames.
    
                There are other reasons we discourage the use of raster images as indoor floorplans. See the code  comments inside AAPLFloorplanOverlay initWithFloorplanURL: for more info.

    This class matches a specific latitude & longitude (a coordinate on Earth)
