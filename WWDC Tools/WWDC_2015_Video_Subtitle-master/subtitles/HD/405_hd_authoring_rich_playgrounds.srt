00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:25,966
>> SAM: Good morning.


2
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:31,316
[Applause]


3
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:33,666
So thank you all for
coming to today's session


4
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,026
on authoring rich Playground.


5
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:37,516
My name is Sam, and I'm an
engineer on the Xcode team.


6
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:41,166
So Playgrounds have been
out for about a year now,


7
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,976
and we've been absolutely
blown away


8
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,966
by what you guys
have done with them.


9
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:46,016
We've seen everything from
people writing their first


10
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:47,516
"Hello, world" all the way


11
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:49,676
up to people writing
entire books in Playgrounds.


12
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,576
The response has
just been amazing.


13
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,536
So today we're going to be
covering a couple of things.


14
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:57,196
We're going to be talking
about some of the new features


15
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,846
that were added to
Playground since last year,


16
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:01,996
and we're also going to cover
some of the existing features


17
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:02,736
that have been updated.


18
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,355
And we'll also cover
some tips and tricks


19
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,846
that can help you author
really, really rich Playgrounds,


20
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,316
Playgrounds that
you want to share


21
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,196
with the rest of the world.


22
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:14,086
And as a bit of a
bonus, we're also going


23
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:16,976
to be solving a problem that's
common among WWDC attendees,


24
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:21,446
and that is how to
explore San Francisco.


25
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:23,766
So what is the problem?


26
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,956
Well, San Francisco
is a big place.


27
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:30,916
There's a whole lot to see,
but really you're not going


28
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,396
to find a lot of time to
do it between the sessions


29
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:36,226
and the labs and writing
your next great apps.


30
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:39,416
And you probably have a flight
to catch at the very end


31
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,566
of the week, so there's
an endpoint here.


32
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:45,676
And as engineers, we
want to be as efficient


33
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,776
as we can possibly be
when we solve problems,


34
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,476
which in the context of this
problem means we just don't want


35
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:52,586
to walk any further
than we have to.


36
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:54,976
So how are we going
to solve this problem?


37
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,396
Well, once we know the
places that we want to visit,


38
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,286
we're going to start
out at Moscone Center,


39
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:02,486
traverse all the places
that we're going to see


40
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:05,076
in the quickest way possible
before we finally have to jet


41
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:07,076
out for San Francisco
International Airport.


42
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:09,895
Now to do this we're going
to be building a Playground.


43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,386
So without further ado,
let's get into that.


44
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:25,026
Okay, so I've got a
Playground already kind of set


45
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:27,266
up for us here, and we'll
just take a quick moment to go


46
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:27,966
through what we've got.


47
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,686
So first up we've got a
struct here for place.


48
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:33,476
So places are going to be
what we want to see when we're


49
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:37,836
in San Francisco, and they're
going to have a name as a string


50
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:41,086
and a location as a
CLLocationCoordinate2D.


51
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,136
Next up we've got
a struct for city.


52
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:48,046
So in the context of our
problem this is going


53
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:49,296
to represent San Francisco.


54
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:52,676
And we can think of this
as a collection of places.


55
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:54,046
It's our own type to
hold these things.


56
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:57,246
So internally we've
got an array of places,


57
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:59,036
and then we've got
a function here


58
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,956
that we can add places
to our city.


59
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,326
So let's go ahead and
just create our city.


60
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:06,906
We're going to call
it San Francisco.


61
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,886
And like I said, we need to
start our journey somewhere.


62
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:13,066
So we're going to go
ahead and create a place


63
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,946
for Moscone Center, which is
where we're going to start.


64
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:16,996
So let's create Moscone there.


65
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,136
And then finally
we're just going


66
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:20,976
to add the place to our city.


67
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,826
So those of you who are familiar
with Playgrounds are going


68
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:26,936
to remember that for each
line of code that executes,


69
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,506
we get a result in the
results sidebar over here.


70
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:33,096
So we can see that our add place
function is called, and it looks


71
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,916
like we are passing in
Moscone Center to that.


72
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,746
But if you look at it further


73
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:38,976
down where we've created
our city and our place,


74
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:40,646
all we're getting is the type.


75
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:44,256
So this is handy,
but we kind of want


76
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,836
to be a bit more descriptive,
especially if we're going


77
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,226
to be creating a
few more places.


78
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:50,176
If we see place after place
after place, we're not going


79
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,576
to be able to differentiate
these things.


80
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:55,546
So for our places, the most
descriptive thing is the name.


81
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:59,086
So how do we get the name to be
returned in our results sidebar?


82
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,406
Well for that we've
got a new protocol,


83
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:03,726
and that is called
Custom String Convertible.


84
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:09,216
So what I can do is I'll extend
my struct here for place to say


85
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:09,536
that I'm going


86
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:11,186
to be implementing
Custom String Convertible.


87
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,866
And you can see now
I've got an area here


88
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,426
because they're not actually
conforming to the protocol yet.


89
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:19,435
So to actually conform to
the protocol we just need


90
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:21,646
to implement a re
[unintelligible] property


91
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:22,636
called description.


92
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:25,826
And that's going
to return a string.


93
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,226
And for us, we want to
return the name of our place


94
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:29,936
because that's the
most descriptive thing.


95
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,416
So you can see now, if
we look back down to


96
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,496
where we created our place,


97
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,526
we've got Moscone Center here
instead of just the type name.


98
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,336
So what does this
mean for our city?


99
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,476
Well probably the most
descriptive thing there is


100
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:45,826
to return the list of places
that are currently in the city


101
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:47,696
so we can see how our
journey is progressing.


102
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:50,716
So we're going to go ahead
and do the exact same thing


103
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:53,846
for city, just implement Custom
String Convertible there.


104
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:58,756
And go ahead and
return the description.


105
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:02,466
And for that we're going to
return to places.description,


106
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,656
so the description of
our array of places.


107
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:07,986
So now you can see when we
first created San Francisco,


108
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:10,006
we don't actually
have anything in it


109
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:12,036
yet so we get an
empty array here.


110
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:16,066
But then when we add our place
to it, we get Moscone Center.


111
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,896
So when we create more and more
places we're going to see more


112
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,516
and more in our results sidebar.


113
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,386
So one of the cool things


114
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,296
about Playgrounds is
you're always able to kind


115
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:28,386
of get a deeper look and get
more information about a result


116
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,546
by clicking this Quick Look
here right next to the result.


117
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,276
So I click that for
Moscone Center.


118
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:37,386
We see a bit more
information about our place.


119
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:40,826
So we've got the name and we've
got the latitude and longitude.


120
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:45,526
This is superhandy to debug
but, I don't know, latitude


121
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:46,996
and longitude doesn't
really help me.


122
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:48,536
I'm not that great
at cartography.


123
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,706
I don't know how to position
these things in the world.


124
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,516
So I kind of want to see
something a bit more visual,


125
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,506
something that just kind


126
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:56,656
of screams out, yeah,
that's a place.


127
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,776
And to me nothing
screams "place" more


128
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,086
than just a big blue dot
with a name underneath,


129
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:03,556
something I would put on a map.


130
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:05,226
So how are we going to do that?


131
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,636
Well normally when
we kind of want


132
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:10,046
to do something a bit custom
and visual, we create a view.


133
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,586
So we're going to go ahead


134
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:13,436
and just create a UI
View subclass here.


135
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,426
And we've got some of
that already set up.


136
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:19,186
And let's just take a
quick moment to look


137
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:20,026
through what we've got there.


138
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:23,276
So we've got a class
here called View.


139
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:25,656
It's going to be a
UI View subclass.


140
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,606
And just internally we've
got another view that's going


141
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:29,956
to be our big blue dot view.


142
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:32,396
And then we've got a
name label that's going


143
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:33,786
to show the name of our place.


144
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,856
And then when we create
this thing, we're just going


145
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,486
to let it decide how
big it wants to be.


146
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,856
And finally in layout
subviews we're just going


147
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,946
to position these things
so that blue dot's on top


148
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:43,926
and the text is below.


149
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:48,046
So we'll create one of these
just to see how it looks first,


150
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:51,476
and we're going to pop
open the Quick Look.


151
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,606
Cool, that's starting to
be a bit more like a place,


152
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,286
like I can see that
appearing on a map.


153
00:06:57,836 --> 00:07:00,736
But how do we actually
join these things up so


154
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:04,666
when we Quick Look our place, we
actually see our view returned?


155
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,376
Well for that we've got
another new protocol,


156
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:10,266
and that protocol is
called Custom Playground


157
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:10,816
Quick Lookable.


158
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:13,896
So what Custom Playground
Quick Lookable does is


159
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:17,286
if you implement the required
method there, it will allow you


160
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:20,896
to return another type to
appear as the Quick Look


161
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,666
for your type or any other type.


162
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,896
So that could be something
like a Bezier path or a color.


163
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:27,756
But for our case we
want to return our view.


164
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:29,896
So what I'm going to go ahead


165
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:36,166
and do is just create an
extension for our place and say


166
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:36,636
that that's going


167
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,766
to be implementing Custom
Playground Quick Lookable.


168
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,076
And so again, we've
got an error here


169
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:42,726
because we're not actually
conforming to that yet.


170
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:44,716
So we'll just add
the conformance there


171
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:47,346
by implementing the Custom
Playground Quick Look method.


172
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,306
And so inside that
method we're just going


173
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:54,456
to return a Playground Quick
Look that's reflecting the view.


174
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:57,316
Now because we're an extension
on place, we have access


175
00:07:57,396 --> 00:08:00,476
to the name of our place, so
we can just go ahead and throw


176
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:01,536
that into the initializer there.


177
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:06,016
So now, when we Quick Look our
place again, we should see,


178
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,206
cool, we've got Moscone Center
there and everything is starting


179
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,026
to look a bit more like a place.


180
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:14,116
But we've kind of
ended up in a bit


181
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:15,336
of code here that's just hanging


182
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:17,256
around in the rest
of our Playground.


183
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:19,926
And we kind of want to move
this just out of the way


184
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,236
because no one else
really cares about this.


185
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:24,256
It's not really helping us to
show what we're trying to do.


186
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,156
So for this we're just
going to go ahead and,


187
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:28,926
well first we're going to
delete this place view here


188
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:29,666
because we don't need that.


189
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:33,775
And we're going to grab the
view here that we declared


190
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:37,336
and we're going to just go
ahead and put that directly


191
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,126
in our extension on place.


192
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,176
Clean up some white space here.


193
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:46,036
And so when the Playground
reexecutes you should just see,


194
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:48,336
cool, exactly what
we saw before but now


195
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:51,366
that view code is all just
embedded within our extension


196
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,236
so it's nice and clean.


197
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:55,856
What does this mean
for our city?


198
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,186
So if we're following the
kind of pattern that we want


199
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:02,206
to see what's in our city at
the moment, then we kind of want


200
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,416
to see what places
are in our city.


201
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,706
And so this is going
to happen by default.


202
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,776
So if we click on the Quick
Look for Moscone Center,


203
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:09,136
we can see we've got
a place in there.


204
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:12,416
And we can see the Moscone
Center, little blue dot


205
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:16,636
in there, but as we add
more places, it's not going


206
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:17,366
to help us all that much.


207
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:18,346
It's just going to be listed up.


208
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,426
We kind of want to visualize
how these things are positioned


209
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,176
to each other based
on their location


210
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,076
so we can start working out,
well if we're at Moscone Center,


211
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,036
you know, we're probably
not going to go directly


212
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,176
to Golden Gate Bridge, we'll
probably go to something


213
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,216
like Coit Tower first.


214
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:35,176
So for that we're going to
create another extension.


215
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:36,046
This time on City.


216
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:39,396
It's going to be again, Custom
Playground Quick Lookable,


217
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,296
and we'll do that here.


218
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:42,496
I've got a bit of
code ready for that.


219
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:44,716
And we'll just walk
through this real quickly.


220
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:46,616
So it's an extension on City,


221
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,766
same way I implemented Custom
Playground Quick Lookable.


222
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:50,376
We have conformed to that


223
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,556
by implementing the Custom
Playground Quick Look


224
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:52,956
method here.


225
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:55,566
And then inside we're just
going to create a view,


226
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,946
work out where these
things would be positioned


227
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:00,686
within that view based on their
latitude and longitude pair.


228
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:06,296
So now when we Quick Look
our city we should see, cool,


229
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,406
Moscone Center on the
eastern side there


230
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:11,726
by a little blank map, but we're
starting to build up a picture


231
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,626
about what we're actually going
to be seeing while we're here.


232
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:16,896
So now that we've got
this kind of in place,


233
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:18,686
we're going to add
a few more places.


234
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,796
But before we do
that, I kind of want


235
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:23,426
to keep this map view here
just open all the time,


236
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:24,246
or at least visual.


237
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:27,266
I'm opening and closing it a lot
when I want to check my code.


238
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:30,966
Well for that we've got this
cool little thing called an


239
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:31,696
inline result.


240
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:34,876
So right next to this Quick Look
button if I click Show Result,


241
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:36,756
that's just going to
go ahead and throw


242
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,876
that Quick Look directly
under the line of code


243
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:42,846
that generated it so I can
keep working on my Playground


244
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:44,296
and see it constantly running


245
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,086
and see what's actually
happening.


246
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,946
And the cool thing is it's
kind of small right now


247
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:51,866
so we can actually just
grab it and drag it


248
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:54,136
out like we would any other
window and make it as big


249
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:54,916
or as small as we want.


250
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,766
So cool, we can start working
on the rest of our Playground,


251
00:10:58,836 --> 00:10:59,736
adding our places to that,


252
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,356
and we should see them
pop up in our map.


253
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:03,886
So what do we want to see?


254
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:08,256
I've heard Golden Gate Bridge
is pretty cool and famous,


255
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:09,976
so I'm going to go ahead
and check that out.


256
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,886
We'll add that to the
places that we want to see.


257
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,056
And when the Playground
reexecutes we'll see that based


258
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,706
on the location of our
Golden Gate Bridge,


259
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:19,746
we're going to be putting
that in the northwest,


260
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,926
which if my knowledge


261
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:24,776
of San Francisco geography is
correct, I think that's true.


262
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:28,056
What else do we want to see?


263
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:29,186
Sutro Tower, how about that?


264
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,196
That's kind of like something
out of War of the Worlds,


265
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:35,746
going to chuck that in and put
that in the places as well,


266
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:37,876
going to chuck in Sutro Tower.


267
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:39,786
And the Playground reexecute


268
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:43,036
and then we'll see
Sutro Tower down south.


269
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:45,496
So we're starting to get
a really good picture


270
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,916
of how our places are built
up, and as we add more and more


271
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,366
of these things we can see,


272
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:52,016
based on where their
location is, how we're going


273
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:52,916
to be getting between them.


274
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,336
I'm just going to go ahead
and switch back to slides now.


275
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,006
So you may have noticed that our
Playground got a little bit long


276
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:01,776
towards the end of that.


277
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:05,646
We had some view code and some
extensions, and there's a lot


278
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:07,736
of stuff that wasn't
really helping us to kind


279
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,106
of describe the problem.


280
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,646
It was not that great.


281
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:15,196
So what we kind of want to do is
pull a lot of that code directly


282
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,496
out of the main body of the
Playground but still keep it


283
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:18,726
around so we can use it.


284
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:20,776
So to show you how
we're going to do that,


285
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,646
I'd like to invite my colleague
Connor up to the stage.


286
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:33,416
[Applause]


287
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:34,536
>> CONNOR: Thank you, Sam.


288
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:35,666
Hello everyone.


289
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,396
My name is Connor and I'm an
engineer on the Xcode team.


290
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:39,866
Today I'll be talking to you


291
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,206
about how you can make your
Playgrounds more powerful


292
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:45,356
and making them even more
focused on the problem at hand.


293
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:47,796
In order to do this, let's
dive straight into a demo


294
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:50,556
where I'll take a look at the
Playground that Sam just started


295
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:52,456
and add support for
finding the best path


296
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:55,516
through San Francisco while
making it more focused.


297
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,286
Let's head over to
the demo machine now.


298
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:10,466
Okay, so here we are in Xcode.


299
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:13,316
And if you noticed, we've got
basically the same Playground


300
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:14,236
that Sam was just showing you.


301
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,456
We start off by creating
a city for San Francisco.


302
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:21,656
We create a few places, and then
we add those places to the city,


303
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:25,526
ending up with this great inline
result showing you what we've


304
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:26,326
built up so far.


305
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:29,846
If you notice though, there
is one major difference,


306
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:32,146
and that's that the
entire Playground now fits


307
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:32,956
on one screen.


308
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:36,496
I'm still using my custom
city in place structs, though.


309
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:39,496
And even though Swift compiler's
pretty great, it isn't able


310
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,406
to actually create structs
out of thin air yet.


311
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,516
So what we're using instead
is a feature which we added


312
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:46,896
in Xcode 6.3 called
Auxiliary Sources.


313
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,716
The auxiliary sources are
additional Swift source files,


314
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,576
which are embedded
inside of your Playground,


315
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:55,286
and they're precompiled into
a separate swift module.


316
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,146
Because they don't
need to be interactive,


317
00:13:58,266 --> 00:14:00,506
they can perform better
than the Playground itself.


318
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,766
Additionally, since they're
in a separate module,


319
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:07,036
you can use access control
to ensure that only the bits


320
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:09,516
of your Auxiliary Sources which
you want to be made visible


321
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,736
to the Playground are exposed,
so you can hide a bunch


322
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:13,266
of internal implementation
details


323
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,386
in the auxiliary sources.


324
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,656
To find them, we'll go ahead
and open up the navigator.


325
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,426
In your PC, we've got the
Playground at the top.


326
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:22,156
And then inside


327
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:23,776
of the Playground we've
got thr sources folder.


328
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:26,226
In the sources folder
we've just got a collection


329
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:27,196
of Swift source files.


330
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:30,986
I can open one up, and
here we've got city.swift,


331
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:35,256
and it's basically the same
struct that Sam was just working


332
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:36,786
on with a few minor
modifications.


333
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:41,606
First, I'd mark it as public
because we want the city


334
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,906
to be able to be used by
the main Playground itself.


335
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,646
I've also added support for
travel times to the city


336
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,846
so that we can actually keep
track of the time needed to get


337
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,676
between each place in the city.


338
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:58,276
If we look at place.swift, we
see the same basic stuff here.


339
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,896
So same struct that we
had before, just modified


340
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,706
to become public and with
a few modifications to work


341
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:05,586
with the updated city struct.


342
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:08,466
I have a couple of other
auxiliary source files,


343
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:09,856
which I'm not going
to dive into.


344
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:12,076
One has to do with
property list serialization,


345
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,036
and the other one is kind
of a grab bag of utilities


346
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,606
that I've just pulled
together from other projects


347
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,436
that I've worked on,
and it will help me


348
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:19,136
out when I'm implementing
our algorithm.


349
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:21,646
Let's switch back to
the main Playground now.


350
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:26,166
And so here we see that we have,
you know, the start of a city.


351
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,326
We're starting to
build something up,


352
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,506
but I want to visit more
than just these two places,


353
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:35,146
and we also want to have all
the travel times between places.


354
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:38,516
I could add all of that in
code, but that wouldn't be great


355
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:40,176
because we'd have a
bunch of code at the top


356
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:41,676
of the Playground, which
isn't really instructive


357
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:42,866
to what we're trying to show.


358
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:45,766
So instead I'm going to take
advantage of another feature


359
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:48,446
that we have in Playgrounds
called Embedded Resources.


360
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:52,016
The embedded resources
are files which are copied


361
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:55,056
into the Playground itself
and are made available


362
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:56,666
to the Playground when it runs


363
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,876
as the resources
of the main bundle.


364
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:01,076
And they live in the
navigator as well,


365
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,326
in this little Resources folder.


366
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,456
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to drag in a plist


367
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:09,226
from the Finder that defines
the city of San Francisco.


368
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,086
So I'll go ahead and do that.


369
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:12,736
I've got the SanFrancisco.plist.


370
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,736
I can drag it in here,


371
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:17,476
and it will get copied
inside the Playground file.


372
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:18,836
This means that we
don't have to worry


373
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:20,756
about any external file
references breaking


374
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:21,686
when you decide that you want


375
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:22,926
to share your Playground
with someone else.


376
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,416
It's all just in there so you
can send it as a discreet unit.


377
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:28,556
Let's take a look at what
this plist looks like.


378
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,536
And so first we've got
an array of places.


379
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:35,366
Each place is just
mapping a latitude


380
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,656
and a longitude to a name.


381
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:39,786
And then let's scroll
down a bit in this file.


382
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:42,936
We'll see here that we've
got an array of travel times.


383
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:46,316
And a travel time is just
mapping two places to the time


384
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,696
and minutes needed to
get between those places,


385
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:54,356
these times gathered using
the trans directions in iOS 9.


386
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,516
Now even though I'm calling
these destination and origin,


387
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:00,846
I am making this a little
bit simpler and assuming


388
00:17:00,846 --> 00:17:02,226
that the time it takes
to get from point A


389
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:05,006
to point B is the same as
the time to get from point B


390
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:07,826
to point A, so these are
actually bidirectional


391
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:08,656
travel times.


392
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:11,496
Switch back to the
main Playground now.


393
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:15,096
And instead of having all
this code here, I'm just going


394
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:18,266
to select a bunch of it and
delete it and replace it


395
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:21,465
with a call to load my
city of San Francisco.


396
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:25,205
So start out by calling
this initializer on city,


397
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:27,316
call contents of
property list at URL.


398
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:30,226
And what it will do is that
it will just simply look


399
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:33,166
at the main bundle to get the
URL for a particular resource,


400
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:35,526
this San Francisco plist.


401
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:40,366
We know that we've just added
this into the Playground,


402
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,806
so I'll force unwrap
that optional


403
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:45,286
so I can pass it
to my initializer.


404
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,506
Additionally, this
initializer has been updated


405
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:50,776
to take advantage of Swift
2's error handling feature.


406
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:52,366
So I'll indicate to the compiler


407
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:55,056
that I know it can throw an
error with the Try keyword


408
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,486
and add an exclamation point
at the end because I don't want


409
00:17:57,486 --> 00:18:00,416
to add a bunch of error handling
code that's not instructive


410
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,776
for what I'm trying to
show in this Playground.


411
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:05,066
Additionally, I know that this
plist is correct, so it's okay


412
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,586
for me to load it this way.


413
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:09,296
We can show this inline now.


414
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:13,216
And let's make it a
little bit bigger.


415
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:15,176
So here we've got our city now.


416
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:19,166
We've got the Moscone Center,
Coit Tower, Fisherman's Warf,


417
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,966
the Painted Ladies, Sutro
Tower, Golden Gate Park,


418
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,996
Golden Gate Bridge, and
not pictured in our map


419
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,666
but still there is the San
Francisco International Airport.


420
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,496
And you can see all
the connections leading


421
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:30,106
to the airport.


422
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:33,336
So great, we've got a city
that we can work with now.


423
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:35,276
But now that I look at it,


424
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:37,736
I think I'd like to make this
Quick Look a little bit nicer


425
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,726
by adding in some icons for
all the places that I'll visit.


426
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:44,466
And it just so happens that
on my desktop I've got this


427
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:45,196
Images folder.


428
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,926
And if I open that up you can
see, here we've got a bunch


429
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,626
of icons for each
of these places.


430
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:53,366
So I'll just go ahead and
take those and drag them


431
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:55,246
into the Resources
folder as well.


432
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:57,656
Just like the plist,
they'll be copied in there


433
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:59,126
and be made available
to my Playground.


434
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:02,176
I do need to update my
Quick Look to take advantage


435
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:02,956
of these images, though.


436
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:06,796
So I'm going to go ahead and
open up the place.swift file


437
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:09,106
in the Assistant editor
by option clicking on it.


438
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:12,786
I will then find
this location view,


439
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:15,546
and instead of initializing
it to just the blue circle,


440
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,656
we're going to update this to
take advantage of the images.


441
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:24,026
So I can take all that code and
we will update our place view.


442
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,046
We'll start off by getting the
image associated with that,


443
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,496
create an image view,
and then set a couple


444
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:30,686
of properties before
returning it.


445
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:34,366
Now when I save this
file, Xcode will notice


446
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:35,986
that the auxiliary
sources have changed


447
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:38,396
and will automatically
recompile their Swift module.


448
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,456
Once the compile finishes, we'll
rerun the Playground itself


449
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:45,046
and so the Quick Look
will update automatically.


450
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,276
I didn't have to
do anything more


451
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:47,946
than just make an
edit and save to disc.


452
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,946
So great. That Quick
Look looks a lot better.


453
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,626
Let's switch back to
the standard editor


454
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:54,416
and start working
on our algorithm.


455
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:56,276
I'm also going to
hide the navigator


456
00:19:56,276 --> 00:20:00,566
because I don't need it and
I'd like the extra space.


457
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:03,766
So we're implementing a brute
force algorithm to find our way


458
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:04,676
through San Francisco.


459
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,416
And in order to get
that started,


460
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,686
we need to just get all the
paths through San Francisco.


461
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:10,266
So we'll start with this


462
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:13,176
and what we do is we
just call this all paths


463
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,706
through city method on our city
struct, telling it that we want


464
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,816
to start at the Moscone
Center and that we want


465
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,756
to end at the airport.


466
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:21,086
And if you look in the
sidebar at the right,


467
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,446
we see that we have 720 paths.


468
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,126
I'll then implement
the algorithm itself,


469
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:31,416
and here we're just starting
with a couple of variables


470
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,636
which will hold our results, one
being for the best travel time


471
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:36,156
and one for the best path.


472
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:40,096
We'll then iterate over all
the paths through the city,


473
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:42,836
getting the travel
time for each path.


474
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:45,956
We'll then compare that
to our best travel time,


475
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:48,286
updating our result
variables if necessary.


476
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:53,276
Finally, at the end we can
see here the best travel time


477
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:55,876
through the city so we'll
show that inline and we'll see


478
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:59,036
that it will take 235 minutes
to get between all these places


479
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,696
if we never stopped and
somehow managed to make all


480
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:02,676
of our transit connections.


481
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:07,316
We can also add the path itself
inline, and so we can see


482
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:08,996
that we'll start off
at the Moscone Center,


483
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:10,316
which is what we expected.


484
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:12,976
We'll then head over to
Painted Ladies and Sutro Tower.


485
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,616
Then up to Golden Gate Park
and Golden Gate Bridge.


486
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,726
Then we'll head ove
to Fisherman's Warf


487
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:20,036
and Coit Tower before heading


488
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,186
down to the San Francisco
International Airport


489
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,006
to catch our flight.


490
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:26,726
So great, I've got all the
information that I need


491
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:30,386
to go see the sights
so let's switch back


492
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:32,906
to slides now to
take care of that.


493
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:52,786
So I just showed you how you
can use the auxiliary sources


494
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:55,036
and the embedded resources
features in Playgrounds


495
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:57,716
to make your Playgrounds more
powerful while keeping them


496
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,016
incredibly focused on the task


497
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:00,566
that you're trying
to actually achieve.


498
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:03,796
I think I have something
pretty interesting here,


499
00:22:03,796 --> 00:22:05,226
and I'd like to share
it with people


500
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,666
when I get back home
from the conference.


501
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,426
But it's not quite polished
enough that I'd be ready


502
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:10,556
to show it to other people.


503
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:13,896
We've added a bunch of great
features in Xcode 7, though,


504
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,106
which makes sharing
your Playground


505
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:16,566
with the world even
better than before.


506
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:19,606
So now I'd like to invite my
colleague Matt up on stage


507
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:21,686
to show you about that.


508
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:22,386
Thank you.


509
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:28,546
[Applause]


510
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,186
>> MATT: Thank you
so much, Connor.


511
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:30,726
Hi everybody.


512
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:33,676
My name is Matt and I'm also
an engineer on the Xcode team.


513
00:22:34,256 --> 00:22:36,506
And I think Connor and Sam
have done a wonderful job


514
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:38,886
of putting together a
really awesome Playground


515
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,376
that shows people how to
get around San Francisco


516
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:42,406
in the best way possible.


517
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:45,266
But it really isn't ready
to be shared with the world,


518
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,316
so I'm going to show you a
few tips and tricks you can do


519
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:49,996
to make your Playground
richer and more engaging


520
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:51,636
so you can put it out
there on the Internet


521
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:52,526
and people will love it.


522
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,546
So you can see here
we have the Playground


523
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:06,456
as Connor just finished
working with it.


524
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,766
And we have a very simple
algorithm that Connor wrote,


525
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:12,606
which walks through all the
possible paths in the city


526
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:15,096
of San Francisco and
compares them to one another.


527
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:16,866
And it was great for you guys


528
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,106
because we had Connor here
explaining every step of the way


529
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,056
as he was implementing it.


530
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,676
However, when we share
this with the world,


531
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:24,476
unfortunately not
everyone was here at WWDC.


532
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:27,946
So we'd like to add a little
bit of information, a little bit


533
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:29,476
of context, so that people


534
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:32,616
who view this Playground later
will understand exactly how we


535
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:33,016
got here.


536
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,656
So we introduced a new feature


537
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:39,436
in Xcode 6.3 called
Playground Markup Comments.


538
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:41,766
And that allows you to
annotate your Playground


539
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:44,656
with rich prose formatted
in beautiful displays


540
00:23:45,076 --> 00:23:48,056
so that people can better
understand exactly how you got


541
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:49,416
to the Playground
that you arrived at.


542
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,476
So just to give us a little bit
more space I'm going to start


543
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:56,186
by putting away our Quick
Look here, and I'm going


544
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,106
to replace the comment at
the top of the Playground


545
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:03,256
with a little bit of information
about exploring San Francisco.


546
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,656
Now you can see this
looks a lot like a comment


547
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:07,476
that you would put anywhere
else in your source file,


548
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,576
but the biggest difference


549
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:11,216
that differentiates
a rich markup comment


550
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:13,486
from another comment
is the colon.


551
00:24:13,756 --> 00:24:16,386
We've got a colon after the
first asterisk in the comment,


552
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:19,426
and we can actually do that as
well with single-line comments.


553
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,196
So add a colon over
here as well.


554
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:23,506
And when I go up
to the Editor menu


555
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:27,326
and choose Show Rendered Markup,
you'll see that this rerenders


556
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:30,296
and now we have these
beautiful rich blocks of text


557
00:24:30,606 --> 00:24:32,126
that we can use when we want


558
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:33,696
to explain what's
happening in our Playground.


559
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,646
We can actually format them
a little bit more as well.


560
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:42,056
So if I switch back to the raw
markup, I can use a number sign


561
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,466
to indicate that we'd
like a heading to indicate


562
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:45,606
"Exploring San Francisco."


563
00:24:45,606 --> 00:24:48,696
And I could use, for
example, asterisks around


564
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,446
"most efficient," to indicate


565
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:51,806
that we want this
to be in italics.


566
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:53,986
So if I render this again,


567
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:57,536
you'll see that now we've
got a nice, big, bold heading


568
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:59,876
that explains exactly what
we're going to be talking about.


569
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:01,076
So that's a great start.


570
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:03,496
I'd also like to
annotate a little bit more


571
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:06,856
about the other things that are
happening in this Playground.


572
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,056
For instance, all paths.


573
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:11,226
All paths through the
city is a little bit vague


574
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:12,726
and it's a little
bit mysterious,


575
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:14,586
so I'd like to add a
little bit of information


576
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:19,396
about how those paths
were computed.


577
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:22,816
And the algorithm itself could
probably use a little bit


578
00:25:22,816 --> 00:25:23,766
of explanation as well.


579
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:25,996
So we'll document the algorithm.


580
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:29,916
And if I switch back once
more to the rendered markup,


581
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:31,726
you'll see now we're
starting to get something


582
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:34,266
that looks much more
like almost a book,


583
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:36,086
something that a user
could sit down with,


584
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:37,386
walk through, and understand.


585
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:39,966
We've even got a nice
bolded list, which we use


586
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:42,426
by inserting an asterisk
at the start of each line.


587
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:45,026
So that's pretty awesome.


588
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:47,786
But it isn't quite rich enough.


589
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,256
We want to take it just
a little bit further.


590
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:52,556
So to do that, we're
going to do a feature


591
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:54,846
that we introduced a long
time ago on Playgrounds


592
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:58,486
that is now even better on
Xcode 7, and that's Live Views.


593
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,006
So I've taking the liberty
of writing a live view.


594
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,726
I've put it into the auxiliary
sources already, and we're going


595
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:07,416
to start by showing it
alongside this Playground


596
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:10,266
to visualize exactly how
this algorithm works.


597
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,346
So the first step to using
Live Views is that you need


598
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:17,286
to import XCPlayground, which
is a module that has a bunch


599
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,226
of really awesome
functions that allow you


600
00:26:19,226 --> 00:26:20,846
to do some pretty cool
stuff with Playgrounds.


601
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:24,336
Now you're also welcome to do
this in your auxiliary sources


602
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:26,526
and create, for instance,
a helper method


603
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:27,616
that shows your live view.


604
00:26:27,616 --> 00:26:29,206
You don't need to do that
in the main Playground.


605
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:30,646
But I'm going to do
it right here just


606
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,216
so it's must clearer
how it all works.


607
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:36,276
Once we've got our city of
San Francisco we're ready


608
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:39,096
to show it, so I'm going to
instantiate a view controller


609
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:43,136
with our new city view
controller, and I'm going


610
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,166
to pass in the city
of San Francisco.


611
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:49,986
I'm then going to use
the XCPShowView function,


612
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:53,416
give it the name of a city,


613
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:56,786
and pass in our view
controller's view.


614
00:26:58,136 --> 00:27:00,836
So if now I switch over and
show our Assistant editor


615
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:05,146
after the Playground reexecutes,
we'll see a live view


616
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,056
that looks just like the
city of San Francisco.


617
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:16,706
And you can see that we've taken
the idea of the rich Quick Looks


618
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:18,426
that we've already added
and we've laid them


619
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:20,526
out onto something that looks
a little bit more realistic


620
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:22,096
so people won't be
quite so disoriented.


621
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:24,286
So that's the first step.


622
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:27,346
But we also want to show how
the algorithm itself works,


623
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:29,946
and to do that we're going
to add a little bit of code


624
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:32,666
that updates the live
view as we're walking


625
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,436
through our algorithm.


626
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:37,336
So we have a loop here that
iterates through all the paths


627
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:40,496
and all paths, and I'm going
to replace that with the method


628
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:44,596
on my view controller called
Visualize Path Iteration.


629
00:27:45,386 --> 00:27:47,916
And I've written that to
use a trailing closure


630
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:51,846
so I can actually update it so
that it looks almost exactly


631
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:53,666
like the loop code
that we originally had.


632
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:56,586
And I'm also going
to add a line in here


633
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:59,556
so we can tell the view code
controller once we've found a


634
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:01,916
better path, we want to
show that better path,


635
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,886
especially on our map.


636
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:07,796
So it will execute
through once more,


637
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:14,236
and when it does you can see now
we're visualizing all the paths


638
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:16,716
as we traverse them through
the city of San Francisco.


639
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:19,276
And this is great
because now people


640
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:22,926
who are reading this program can
really see exactly how we got


641
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:27,176
to our answer of how to find
the best route through the city.


642
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:28,266
You might notice
something, though,


643
00:28:29,436 --> 00:28:32,726
and that's that it's
checking a lot of paths.


644
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:35,836
It's actually checking 720
paths, as Connor pointed


645
00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:38,266
out earlier, and
that's quite a few.


646
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:42,156
In fact by default, live
views run for 30 seconds,


647
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,846
which you can change
with this control


648
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,286
down in the bottom
right of the Playground.


649
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:49,736
And that isn't even enough
time to make it through all


650
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:51,216
of the paths through the
city of San Francisco.


651
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:52,916
Now we've artificially
slowed it down a little bit


652
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,556
so you can see the
paths as we iterate


653
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:55,426
through them on the live view.


654
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:58,456
But I think when people see
that, they're going to say,


655
00:28:58,456 --> 00:28:59,966
well there must be a better way.


656
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:01,606
And in fact there is.


657
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,276
And we'd like to start out
by showing that to our users


658
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,156
from the very beginning.


659
00:29:06,126 --> 00:29:07,486
So we're going to use
another algorithm.


660
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:10,416
It's a nearest neighbor
approximation algorithm,


661
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,416
and what that's going to
do is it's going to be


662
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,036
as though we were
starting at Moscone.


663
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:16,676
We looked at all the places
that we wanted to visit


664
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:19,186
and then we just picked the
closest one and we went to that.


665
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:21,126
And then from that place
we'll pick the next closest


666
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,066
and we'll go on from there.


667
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:24,936
And if I wanted, I could
implement that right


668
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:27,226
at the bottom of this
Playground document.


669
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:29,596
But that would start to
get a little bit confusing,


670
00:29:29,786 --> 00:29:30,806
and it's not as focused.


671
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:32,926
One of the wonderful
things about Playgrounds is


672
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:35,726
that they're very, very
focused pieces of content,


673
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:37,336
so we want to be able
to preserve that.


674
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:39,976
And to do that we have
a brand new feature


675
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,626
in Xcode 7 called
Pages, which allows you


676
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:44,036
to have multiple
pages of content


677
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:45,616
in a single Playground document.


678
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,866
So to do that we're going
to open the navigator.


679
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:53,216
And in the bottom-left corner
we'll choose the Plus button


680
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:55,616
and click New Page.


681
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,196
And that's going to
create a brand-new page


682
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,566
in the same Playground.


683
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,306
I'm going to call this one
Nearest Neighbor, after the name


684
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:06,106
of the algorithm that
we're going to be using.


685
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:10,546
And then we're going to
rename our initial Playground


686
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:12,846
to Getting Around.


687
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:18,216
Now Pages are also
pretty cool because,


688
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:21,236
like the auxiliary sources and
resources that you can include


689
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,796
in a Playground at
the top level,


690
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:24,736
you can do that on
a per page basis.


691
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:28,516
You can see I can twist open any
one of these Playground pages


692
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,586
and we can embed
their own sources.


693
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:34,626
Any resources of the
same name, for instance,


694
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:37,186
will also override those
in the larger Playground.


695
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,976
So if you want to have some
different branding on each page


696
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:43,026
or a particular image that
is specific to the concept


697
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:44,446
that you're teaching
in each different page,


698
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:45,876
you can do that pretty easily.


699
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,326
So right now I'm going to switch
the nearest neighbor page,


700
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:52,036
switch back to the raw markup.


701
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:54,526
And I've already written up this
algorithm, so I'm just going


702
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:56,406
to go ahead and paste that in.


703
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,106
So what we have here
is a Playground


704
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:03,206
with nearest neighbor
approximation, and you can see


705
00:31:03,206 --> 00:31:07,646
when this one runs it
examines way fewer paths


706
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:08,386
through the city.


707
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,576
Now this is not an
optimal algorithm


708
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,426
in that it won't
necessarily find our best path


709
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:16,156
through the city.


710
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:19,336
But you can see it's already
done, which is pretty cool.


711
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:21,556
So this is a great way
of showing, alright,


712
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,666
there might be more than
one answer to this problem.


713
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:28,796
And if we render
this, we can also show


714
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:34,186
where we got this path from.


715
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:37,436
We actually edited this on,
we found the information


716
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,786
for this algorithm on Wikipedia.


717
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,706
Unfortunately, I
invented a little too far.


718
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:48,856
And we can embed a link
right into the Playground,


719
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:51,286
which would take us to the page
explaining exactly how this


720
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,106
algorithm works.


721
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:55,636
We could also link between
pages in a single Playground


722
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:59,356
and bring it back to our optimal
path that we discovered earlier.


723
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:03,506
And in fact, when we look
at the number of paths


724
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,396
and the different paths that
we took through the city


725
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:07,686
and how long this
algorithm takes to execute,


726
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,706
we examined 720 paths on
this one and find a path


727
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:13,196
that is only 21 minutes
faster than the other page.


728
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,706
So that gives people a frame
of reference for saying,


729
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:17,296
maybe there are other
ways to do it.


730
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:19,816
And they can use a Playground
to experiment with that all


731
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:21,356
by themselves, which
is pretty awesome.


732
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:26,316
So that's adding
sections of markup, Pages,


733
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:27,746
and Live Views in Playgrounds.


734
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:35,626
[Applause]


735
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,646
So we have a lot of
really awesome new features


736
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,016
in Playgrounds in Xcode 7.


737
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:42,566
We showed you Custom Quick
Looks, which allow you


738
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:45,126
to take your custom data
types and make them come alive


739
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:47,166
in the same way that a lot
of the built-in types do.


740
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:50,796
We've also got inline results,
which stay with the Playground,


741
00:32:50,796 --> 00:32:52,996
so you can show results right
next to the line of codes


742
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,696
that produced them, and then
those go with the Playground


743
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:56,736
when you share it
with other people.


744
00:32:57,426 --> 00:33:00,486
We also have Auxiliary Sources
so you can take the code


745
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,206
that goes with your Playground
that isn't as instructive


746
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:06,026
as the code in the main
Playground and put those aside


747
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:09,206
so that your users see only
the API and the functionality


748
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:10,156
that you want them to see.


749
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:13,546
We also have Embedded Resources
so you can bring in images


750
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:16,756
and make things feel even
more alive and more engaging.


751
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:19,176
We've got brand-new
markup comments


752
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:21,966
that are a really great
way to guide your user


753
00:33:22,076 --> 00:33:24,346
through your Playground when
you can't be there with them,


754
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:26,976
enhanced Live Views which
are better than ever,


755
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,846
and Pages which allow you
to cover multiple topics


756
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:32,816
in a single Playground without
distracting from the focus


757
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:34,716
of each of them, which
is really, really cool.


758
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:38,876
So that is what we have
in Playgrounds in Xcode 7.


759
00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:43,556
[Applause]


760
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:46,596
For more information, you
can visit the website.


761
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:48,926
We've got documentation up
there and the developer forums.


762
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:51,756
You can also talk
to Stefan Lesser,


763
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,276
our Developer Tools Evangelist.


764
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,676
We have a number of related
sessions that are going on.


765
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:57,556
We've got Swift in Practice,


766
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:58,946
which is happening
tomorrow afternoon,


767
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:01,036
and Building Better Apps
with Value Types in Swift.


768
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,656
Also the What's New in
Xcode and What's New


769
00:34:02,656 --> 00:34:04,616
in Swift sessions will
be great all week.


770
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:07,596
Thanks so much everybody and
enjoy the rest of the WWDC.


771
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,000
[Applause]
