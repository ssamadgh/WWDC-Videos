>> Good afternoon, and
thank you for joining us.


6
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:33,076
>> Yeah, thanks for coming
to spend time with us


7
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,486
at the end of this long day.


8
00:00:34,486 --> 00:00:39,266
It's for many of you who
were out there last night


9
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,416
when I was leaving the
student event and putting


10
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,876
out your chairs, it got real
cool on the sidewalk, I'm sure,


11
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:47,776
and you spent a whole long
night waiting for this day,


12
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:50,106
and you've been here,
and now you've joined us


13
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,206
to celebrate some
excellent apps.


14
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:54,796
>> And we are here
to award excellence


15
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:57,386
in innovation on
both iOS and OS X.


16
00:00:58,176 --> 00:01:00,386
And every year it gets
more and more difficult


17
00:01:00,586 --> 00:01:02,346
to pick our design winners


18
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,906
because there are
so many great apps.


19
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:10,186
>> Yeah. So many of you, we
shared a statistic this morning


20
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,246
that 70 percent of
the audience here


21
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,336
at WWDC are new to the show.


22
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:16,296
And so many of you
have never been


23
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:17,726
to this show, the design awards.


24
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:19,846
And so we thought
we'd take a moment


25
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,786
to explain how we
pick the winners.


26
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:26,676
We judge the winning apps
using sort of three major --


27
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:29,956
we judge the winning apps
in three major areas.


28
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:32,396
The first is around design.


29
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,736
So for design, we look
at apps that are --


30
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,226
we're looking for apps
that are easy to use.


31
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:40,406
Apps that are familiar.


32
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,336
That are consistent within
themselves, but consistent


33
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,786
within the operating
system as well.


34
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:48,166
They have a great game loop,
so really excellent game play.


35
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,846
They're intuitive
and understandable


36
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,486
and immediately useable by the
people who they were built for.


37
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:57,966
And then we look at apps
in the technology --


38
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,906
we judge apps around technology.


39
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,196
So we're evaluating the
apps on their use of iOS


40
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:07,386
or OS X frameworks to
do really cool stuff


41
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:10,076
or to add really
valuable functionality.


42
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:15,096
Or we're also looking at whether
the app launches quickly.


43
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,496
Is it responsive?


44
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:20,496
Does it take, you know, does it
work the way you would expect it


45
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,026
to work?


46
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,976
And is there smooth scrolling?


47
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:27,446
We look at whether or not the
app runs on the latest OSs,


48
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,216
whether it takes advantage
of the newest hardware.


49
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:34,136
And takes advantage of
things like M7 or A7 on iOS


50
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:37,426
or multicore or other
technologies


51
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:38,946
and hardware technologies
on OS X.


52
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:43,506
And then thirdly, we're
looking at apps from the point


53
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:44,576
of view of innovation.


54
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:48,976
And innovation really is that
spark of brilliance, right,


55
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:53,796
that uniqueness, the clever
implementation of something


56
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:56,556
that you wouldn't have
expected in the first place,


57
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,456
but then when you see it,
you're blown away by it.


58
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,946
And there's just so many ways
to talk about innovation,


59
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:06,376
but really it comes down to
the implementation of something


60
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:10,716
that is just so fresh
and so compelling


61
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:12,286
and done in a unique way.


62
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:15,456
So those three areas are
how we judge the apps.


63
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:18,876
There's so many more things
we look at, but in a nutshell,


64
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:21,636
they're grouped in
those three areas.


65
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:24,036
>> So let's talk
about the prizes


66
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,676
that our award winners
will be given to take home.


67
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:29,746
It's pretty much one of every
piece of hardware that we make.


68
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,906
A Mac Pro with a cinema display.


69
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:33,246
A 27-inch iMac.


70
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:34,726

>> And, last but not least,


77
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:50,566
probably the most coveted
part of the award is:


78
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:54,056
>> Yeah, you get to take home
one of these 88 trophy cubes


79
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:59,206
and these are, you know,
statically they detect touch,


80
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:02,406
they're touch sensitive, so
you touch them, they light up,


81

on the top just like the
back of your MacBook Pro,


82
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,506
the Apple logo lights up.


83
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:12,806
And these are to die for,
must-have Apple products.

And a few of you are
going to get one tonight.

let us get to the winners.

We're going to start with
a few student winners.

You guys have done some great
work to get here, and the apps


100
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:05,466
that we looked at were
really impressive.


101
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,456
So you deserve to
be here this week,


102
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:09,766
and we hope that
you're going to continue


103
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:12,156
to produce some incredible apps


104
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,846
that put the more
veteran developers who are


105
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:18,016
in the audience, you know, give
them a run for the money, right?


106
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:19,606
>> Like these apps,
who have been.


107
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:20,536
>> Like some of these apps.


108
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,996
These were student
winners that we highlighted


109
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:25,706
in previous years, that
we demoed here on stage.


110
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,036
Some of them maybe have
changed names or what have you,


111
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,606
but they were great
apps written by students


112
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:31,916
over the past three years.


113
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,626
>> So let's move on
to our first winner.


114
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:39,486

is "PanoPerfect"


115

>> Congratulations.


120
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:15,726
"PanoPerfect" is a
fun and simple way


121
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,646
to share beautiful
panoramic photos.


122
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,936
These are two former high school
students that attended WWDC


123
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:25,616
in 2012 on student
scholarships and built this app


124
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,986
when they were inspired by our
'06 announcement of panoramics.


125
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,216
And John's going to show us now.


126
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,896
>> Yeah, it's a great story,
sitting in the keynote,


127
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:35,946
watching something, and then
deciding to write an app.


128
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:39,156
I think that's a great story.


129
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:43,206
So "PanoPerfect" is
this app that allows you


130
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:49,166
to view panoramic photos, and
it's there's just a community


131
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,976
of people who love panoramas


132
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:54,326
that are submitting
photos into the app.


133
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,156
So it's a familiar interface.


134
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,686
You're just scrolling
through this,


135
00:06:57,686 --> 00:07:00,926
these guys are using UI kit
dynamics and image effects


136
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:05,156
for blurs on some of the UI,
which we'll get to in a moment.


137
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,436
So this is the explorer,
this is kind


138
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:09,106
of a curated set of panoramas.


139
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:11,716
If we go to nearby
they're using core location


140
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:12,696
to determine where you are.


141
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:17,236
And we're going to go in here,
hopefully, and load some panos.


142
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:20,196
Yeah, here's some
panos that are nearby.


143
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:22,926
A couple of them posted by
the creators of the app.


144
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,406
But let's just go into
this one: We double tap,


145
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:28,766
you can favorite it, you can
like it, you can comment on it.


146
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:32,476
And then you can double tap
and just go in and gesture


147
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:36,156
through the UI to go and
look at the entire panorama.


148
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:41,856
And they're doing low res
thumbnails in the feed


149
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,026
that you see here,
and then they're going


150
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:47,296
to the high res full
panoramas when you go and look


151
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:50,476
into the individual image.


152
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:54,696
So super cool app that
really was created


153
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:59,546
to address the experience that
at the time there was no support


154
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,106
for panoramic images in a lot
of social networking apps.


155
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,556
And so these guys stepped up
and made something really cool.


156
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:05,416
Congratulations.

[ Applause ]


158
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:21,596
All right, the next
app was created


159
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,766
because of the incredible
movement


160
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,346
and growth of iPad in education.


161
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:31,076
And, you know, people
are changing,


162
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,846
iPad has changed the way that
we're learning in the classroom.


163
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:36,596
Changing the way that adults are
learning and kids are learning.


164
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:41,275
And the mix of iPad in
education is really taking off


165
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:44,636
because of the incredible
new apps that are available,


166
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:47,926
interactive textbooks,
really tremendous content.


167
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:52,406
And the creators of this
next app saw all of that,


168
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,536
saw the growth that was going
on and also saw a specific need


169
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,106
that they wanted to
step up to and solve.


170
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,186
So our winner does that.


171
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:03,236
>> And they are "Addimal
Adventure" by Teachley.


172
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:24,696

173
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:25,926
>> Congratulations.


174
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,076
>> Thank you.


175
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:27,796
>> You're welcome.


176
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,306
"Addimal Adventure" is
a fun and engaging app


177
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:36,046
that teaches single-digit
addition.


178
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:36,756
Why don't you come over here?


179
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:37,916
There we go.


180
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,746
It was created by grad students
from Columbia University


181
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,456
who were involved in
research and cognition,


182
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,646
the way kids learn,
and technology.


183
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:48,576
Sinister Professor Possum
has destroyed El Sumado


184
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,906
and is building a robot
that could ruin the world.


185
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:52,866
Join the animals
to win back blocks


186
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,946
and rebuild the golden
city to its former glory.


187
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:55,546
John.


188
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:57,676
>> Right, let's take
a look at this app.


189
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,456
So I'm not going to get into
sinister, you know, situation,


190
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:04,836
get into that whole game
play, but these folks worked


191
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,616
with folks from Sesame Workshop


192
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,496
and created some really
great artwork in the app.


193
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:14,116
The app is focused on teaching
children basic addition,


194
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:17,396
and for a lot of kids
this is a real struggle.


195
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:20,966
And so this developer set
out to solve this problem.


196
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,566
So we're going to
get into the app -


197
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:24,986
we'll skip over the narrative
at the beginning here.


198
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:28,056
This is pretty straightforward
stuff.


199
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:29,706
So most of you are going
to get the answers right


200
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:31,396
without even using the app.


201
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:36,816
But the key here is that the app
is teaching children addition,


202
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:40,896
and when you're first learning
addition, you just, you know,


203
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,196
the first thing you do is you
count on fingers, you just kind


204
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,666
of like 1, 2, 3, you count
them off individually.


205
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,556
And so the app lets you do that.


206
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:52,126
And so I can just tap,
you know, I got 5,


207
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,556
I got some feedback in the UI.


208
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:57,686
I move the slider bar with
the tactile fields to 5,


209
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,656
and I get confirmation that it's
the right answer, or I don't,


210
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:01,526
it was the wrong answer.


211
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:05,766
I can also do count on, which is
a second kind of addition tool.


212
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,946
So once the child has
learned to basically count


213
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,186
through the numbers,
you know, the numbers,


214
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:13,376
then they can start moving on
to different kinds of addition


215
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,596
where they're going
to take a big number


216
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:17,276
and add some smaller
numbers to it.


217
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,666
So in this case, the child's
going to start to learn


218
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,676
that you can start with 3 and
then do 1 more and get 4, right?


219
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:26,816
There we go.


220
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,286
And the app continues to
go on and teach all kinds


221
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:32,436
of other tools and techniques
for learning, addition.


222
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:35,126
Another one is doubles,
where you basically start off


223
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:38,936
with say, you know, 3 and 4 is
7, and so first it shows you


224
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:42,656
that you can cut the 4 into a
3 and you get 3, 3, and 1 is 7.


225
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,986
The app is full of these
kinds of techniques


226
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:46,866
that take advantage
of iOS technologies


227
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:50,676
to do a really great experience
with large text, great colors,


228
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:53,936
and an experience I think that
is really going to resonate


229
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:54,846
with little, little kids.


230
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:56,396
So congratulations.


231
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:57,236
Extremely well done.


232

235

236
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:26,996
>> All right, everybody loves
a great game, and there are


237
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,856
so many games on the App Store.


238
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:34,306
And we had a lot of fun
looking through the best games


239
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:37,336
and trying to figure out which
one was the one that needed


240
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,706
to be a winner, and there are
many that needed to be a winner.


241
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:42,316
Unfortunately we can only
award so many tonight.


242
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:45,856
But one of the types of gaming
- one of the types of games


243
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:48,486
on the App Store that is super
popular that everybody loves,


244
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:53,426
that originated in the
'80s, is the platformer.


245
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:56,576
And in the platformer
game, it's a genre,


246
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,106
what you're doing is you're
basically, you know, running


247
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:04,156
and jumping, moving and jumping,
to avoid obstacles and get coins


248
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:06,716
and save people and get
money, and you know,


249
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:07,536
whatever you're getting.


250
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:11,236
And the whole point is to not
fall off the platform, right?


251
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:14,766
And the way you fall off the
platform is you get, you know,


252
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:17,226
speared, or some
obstacle hits you,


253
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,876
or something falls
on you or whatever.


254
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:21,726
But the point is that the
platform is a pretty loose term,


255
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:23,246
but you're moving
across this thing,


256
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:25,366
and it just goes
on and on and on.


257
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:29,026
And our next winner
has created, I think,


258
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:31,786
one of the most incredible
platformer games today


259

267
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,426
In "Leo's Fortune,"
you hunt down a cunning

00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:17,126
Why don't you stand
over here, folks?


270
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:23,626
Sorry, a cunning and
mysterious gold thief traveling


271
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,606
through lush environments such
as mossy forests, arid deserts,


272
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,536
snow-capped mountains
and pirate cities


273
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:32,016
to uncover the truth
behind Leo's stolen fortune.


274
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,046
>> Great. Well, I'm not going
to go to the snow-capped peaks


275
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:38,976
or underwater or
anything like that.


276
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:41,006
I'm going to show you
the basic game play


277
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:44,316
so that you get a sense
for what's going on.


278
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,416
If I can get the volume brought


279
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,666
down a little bit,
that would be great.


280
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:52,576
All right, so "Leo's Fortune,"
you've got about 25 levels


281
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,166
or more that you can just swipe


282
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,816
through in a very
familiar user interface.


283
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,476
I'm going to start on level
1 because I want to point


284
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:02,936
out something that is such a
great example of their attention


285
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,216
to detail and the way


286
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,756
that they've done
things in this game.


287
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,446
So I'm going to start
the tutorial.


288
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:09,756
And this is really sort


289
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,546
of the onboarding
experience for the app.


290
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,016
And there are so many apps
nowadays that are needing


291
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:17,936
to do this, they want to get
you up, you know, into the app,


292
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,126
and help you understand
how to use the app.


293
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,466
And, you know, you don't
need something that's very,


294
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,286
you know, that's super intense.


295
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:28,776
But to do this well
takes a lot of design


296
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:29,996
and I think a lot of thinking.


297
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,086
And so I want to show you.


298
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:32,666
So the game starts
off like this,


299
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,616
and the first thing you're told
is where to place your thumbs.


300
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:38,436
And in order to do that,
you're immediately learning how


301
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:39,996
to hold the iPad
to play the game.


302
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:42,436
So I'm going to put my left
thumb here, my right thumb here,


303
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:45,516
and now the game starts to work,
and it's got these coach marks.


304
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,096
So I'm going to move the left
thumb, and we're going to start


305
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:50,656
to collect coins with Leo here.


306
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,626
Okay, so here's the
platformer experience, right?


307
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:57,816
You're driving along on this
so-called platform, and boom,


308
00:15:57,816 --> 00:15:59,306
I'm stuck, I can't
get over this thing.


309
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,436
But this onboarding experience
has these ghosting images,


310
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,066
and they tell me that if
I move my right thumb up,


311
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:08,836
I can inflate Leo and
move him up and down.


312
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,316
And now I'm dealing with
an obstacle in this case.


313
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:17,286
Let's keep going.


314
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,886
I'm down there, no
problem, I can go back up.


315
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,736
I can inflate, nope, sorry.


316
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:23,916
Oh come on.


317
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,826
This is the problem
with these demos, right?


318
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:31,416
Okay, here we go, we land
on there, boom, ta-da,


319
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:32,706
here we are, we're
driving around.


320
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:35,736
And notice just the
effects in the background.


321
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:39,556
There's this perspective going
on, you've got petals flying


322
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:42,696
through the air, on other
levels there's rain falling,


323
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:46,156
there's all kinds of stuff
happening in the distance.


324
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:49,446
And here, you're dealing
with this obstacle,


325
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:51,706
and the game is full of
these kinds of obstacles,


326
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:54,636
where Leo has to solve - he
has to do something in one spot


327
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,426
to open a door or
some kind of a bridge.


328
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:59,726
In this case, if I landed
on top, I would die.


329
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,346
And so I'm just going to
inflate him, flip this around,


330
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:05,276
and then move along
and keep jumping.


331
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:08,576
And this is just a real
quick view of what's going


332
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,586
on in this game, but we
just thought they did


333
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:13,465
such a good job, for example,
with this kind of an S curve,


334
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:16,866
which is really hard to

to jump this guy, right, boom.

we just we love this game.

across all their levels,

with touch, for the leveraging

>> All right, we all live busy
lives, and one of the things


351
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,156
that I've learned over time and
other people have learned is


352
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:19,406
that if you can capture some
of the things that are going on


353
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:24,756
and take a moment to record
an idea, a thought, a memory -


354
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,996
or something happens and it
triggers a thought and you want


355
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:32,836
to capture it - that that
exercise of writing things


356
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:36,426
down for a moment, to just
capturing these little bits


357
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,006
of information throughout
the day,


358
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:40,796
is actually a great
way to relieve stress.


359
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,826
It's actually a great
way to build memories


360
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:45,296

developer of the next app,


365
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,646

understands this idea.

But we thought we'd award it
for the Mac and show it off


380
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:08,226
on the Mac, because so many of
us are so busy as developers,


381
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,586
on our Macs every day
- we're writing code,


382
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,106
we're spending time in Xcode
or we're doing, you know,


383
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:16,176
using various tools, you
could be in a spreadsheet,


384
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:18,366
you could be writing
some sort of a document.


385
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,106
But along the way,
something might happen -


386
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,796
you might get a phone
call, a thought pops


387
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,556
into mind, an email arrives.


388
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,176
And you might want
to record an idea


389
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,476
or put something quickly down,


390
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,016
which is a big part
of journaling.


391
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,976
Not sitting down to
write something huge -


392
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:33,546
it's just capturing
these little nuggets.


393
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:37,866
And so "Day One" just
builds a little menu extra


394
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,346
that you can type in and
put some sort of entry in,


395
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:43,516
and that'll go straight into the
blog and then into the journal,


396
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:45,206
and then you're back
to your work.


397
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:50,816
Or we could just go up here,
and we'll just launch the app,


398
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,886
and we can inside of the app,


399
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,776
immediately create
a journal entry.


400
00:20:54,816 --> 00:21:01,006
So I can say, you know, here I
am at the Apple Design Awards,


401
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:12,236
sorry, the trophies are great,
want one of these soon, right?


402
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:13,786
There's my entry.


403
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:16,406
I can take - turns out I've
actually taken a trophy picture


404
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:20,006
earlier, so I can take this
picture, drop it into here,


405
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:22,516
and "Day One"'s going to either
take the date from the picture


406
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,126
or just say leave
it unchanged based


407
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:25,876
on the date I'm answering
this journal entry.


408
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:29,556
And then I say I'm done, I
can tag it with various tags


409
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,956
that are in the system,
I can add a location,


410
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,356
they've got maps integration,


411
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,366
so I could say use current
location if I'd like.


412
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:39,266
And I'm done, and there's the
entry in there, and I can look


413
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:44,156
at my journal over time
using the overall view


414
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:45,296
of all my journal entries.


415
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:48,936
And so here's just a sample
journal that we've got


416
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:52,396
in the app here where you can
take a look at all these entries


417
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:56,796
and go back in time and
see what's going on.


418
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,336
And really that is
the whole point


419
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:02,226
of journaling is capturing these
moments in time as they occur,


420
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:03,326
as they pop into your mind.


421
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,966
And we felt that "Day One"
did such a great job at this.


422
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:10,666
As well, they've got built-in
notifications so you can set


423
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,806
up reminders to put
things into your journal.


424
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:16,246
They've got inspirational
quotes that will pop


425
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:18,176
up when you're going to
create a journal entry


426
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,246
that can be inspiring
and get you writing.


427
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:23,566
And really that's the essence
of a great tool, right,


428
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:27,846
is that it gets the job done,
it doesn't get in the way,


429
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,726
and it's perfectly balanced.


430
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:32,396
And we selected this tool
for being super well designed


431
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:35,796

exactly what it needs

00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:07,126
You know, design is all
about fit and finish.

It's about, you know,
communicating clearly.


440
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:19,956
And iOS really helps
you to do this, right,


441
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:26,096
by helping you focus on
content, getting out of the way,


442
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:30,526
giving you a system that
allows you to draw, you know,

the UI from iOS 7 that
is minimalist in nature.


444

of attention and a lot of focus


445

end up with something that is

>> Yeah, this app is awesome.


460
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:36,686
And if you've not
played this game,


461
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:39,256
you need to see it
from the start.


462
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,686
So the basic point of the game
is, you know, as Shaan said,


463
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:46,656
you gesture and you draw
this little line to knock


464
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:49,586
out the colored dots, and
when you get to a level


465
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:51,636
where there are black dots,
you want to avoid those.


466
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:53,236
But, you know, at
the first level,


467
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:56,886
you're just starting off
here with this gesture.


468
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:00,896
And you know, notice
as I'm playing here,


469
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,966
that there is nothing
extra onscreen,


470
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:06,746
it's just the dots,
it's just my gesture.


471
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:10,586
And the gesture, the rendering
of the gesture is almost


472
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:15,056
like calligraphy, I mean,
it has a flair to it,


473
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:19,746
it's representative of the speed
of my stroke, the exact timing,


474
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,336
the length and everything.


475
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,496
So let me get rid
of these three.


476
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:25,456
So those are easy levels.


477
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:28,826
Let me jump up to level 8 here


478
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:30,076
for a moment, which
is kind of fun.


479
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:33,016
So here I've got an
instance where I've got


480
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:35,306
to avoid the black dots
but get the white ones -


481
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:36,486
or get the colored ones.


482
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:39,466
And to do that I've got to
figure out what gesture to do


483
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:41,786
that will repeat
across the screen


484
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:43,386
to remove these colored dots.


485
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:46,236
Now, the other thing that's
super cool about this app is


486
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:49,776
that it leverages audio
for great feedback.


487
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:56,426
And so there's some very
fun, lightweight, you know,


488
00:25:56,426 --> 00:26:02,776
sounds that come through
as you screw up, basically.


489
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:06,696
You know, so here
I'm messing up.


490
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:07,986
Let me try to do it right.


491
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:14,486
Not quite, not quite, not quite.


492
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:18,186
And the thing about this
game is it's like that.


493
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,526
You're like "Oh blast," and
the sound just gives you this


494
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:21,866
great feedback.


495
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:24,216
One last try.


496
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:29,536
No, come on, John.


497
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:33,276
Okay, I give up.


498
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:36,386
That's the problem
with these demos.


499
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:39,086
Yeah, we love this game
for the minimalist design,


500
00:26:39,136 --> 00:26:43,106
the great integration with the

501
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:47,956
just that expression of
just a great engagement,


502
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:51,736
this great expression of the
game in a very simplistic way

00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:16,226
>> Right. So you know,
we're all, you know,


508
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:18,296
at the conference this
week, and we're crazy busy.


509

You've got 100 and what is
it, 10 sessions to attend,


510
00:27:21,136 --> 00:27:24,696
and so this is just a great
example of how busy we are.


511
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:27,846
If we're not at a conference,
you guys are writing code,


512
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,606
you're going to school,
you're doing life.


513
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:34,806
And if you're anything like me,
you know that it's hard to keep


514
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:37,146
on top of all of the
things that are going


515
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:38,276
on in the world around us.


516
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:43,506
Whether it's in our industry,
whether it's not in our industry


517
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:45,506
but something that interests
us, whether it's sports

or world news or what have you.

And so, you know, it's not
for a lack of news sources,


520
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:53,256
it's just that there's so
much news coming at us.


521
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:59,136
And it's often hard to pick
a quality source of news.


522
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:03,886
It's hard to find one
that is, you know, curated


523
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:06,666
and that's going to give you
what you are really interested


524
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,246
in, in the length that
you want it to be in.


525
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:11,696
And more importantly,
it's even hard


526
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:13,536

summaries of all the important

day in two beautiful digests.

to ensure high quality


540
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,076
and keep you informed of all
the key headlines of the day.


541
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:31,356
>> Let's take a quick
look at "Yahoo!


542
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:32,036
News Digest."


543
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:36,606
So what you get is these
two digests of news


544
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:39,816
with about eight stories in
them in the morning at 8 a.m.


545
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:43,926
and at 6 p.m. in the
evening, and that's it.


546
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:47,186
And so this is one of my
go-to news apps all the time.


547
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:50,276
I wait for these digests to
arrive, and once they arrive,


548
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:54,976
you can just scroll through
this really simple UI,


549
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:58,166
that lists the stories, the
top stories, of the day.


550
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,886
And what they've done really
well is they've, you know,


551
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:05,386
done this automatic collection
of information and aggregation


552
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,856
and all the work that they do
behind the scenes [inaudible],


553
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:10,606
but then they're doing human
curation of the content


554
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:12,256
in addition with their editors.


555
00:30:12,256 --> 00:30:15,036
And so the content that you get,


556
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:19,106
the news stories are
extremely high quality.


557
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:22,006
So here we are, we're
moving through this list,


558
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,816
and you see a political story,


559
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:26,806
there's a U.S. news
story, technology, world.


560
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:31,126
Below each of these story
headlines you've got these


561
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:34,596
little atoms, these little
circles, and you can tap them


562
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:36,596
to get the legend of
what each of these mean,


563
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:38,976
but basically they're telling
you how much information there


564
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:40,366
is available for
one of the stories.


565
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,636
So let's go into the story
about Apple - hey, why not?


566
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:46,716
And you know, the first
time you use it, it says,


567
00:30:46,716 --> 00:30:49,746
how to use the app, and so you
can swipe just right to left


568
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:53,496
around the stories, or
go back into a story


569
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:56,036
and read it in more detail.


570
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,666
And I find that these are,
you know, if I just take


571
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,206
about 10 minutes to plow
through this digest,


572
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:04,696
I've got some great information
about the latest headlines.


573
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:07,566
And so you get these great
call-outs, you're moving


574
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,316
through the stories,
that's pretty much it.


575
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:10,216
It's well laid out.


576
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:13,586
At the bottom you're getting
extra information like photos


577
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:15,536
that might be associated with
this story, that are coming


578
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:16,756
from really good sources.


579
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,926
There might be a
topic breakdown.


580
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:21,376
There might be a video that
loads very, very quickly


581
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:23,866
that it's a quick
summary of the story.


582
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:27,116
There's maps integration,
if it's appropriate.


583
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:30,186
And then you can go
through some top tweets


584
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:34,246
or other social networking
posts that apply to this story.


585
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:38,366
And so that's how each of
the stories is laid out,


586
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:41,606
and so you just flip through
them one by one, and read them,


587
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,706
some really great
visual effects and kind


588
00:31:43,706 --> 00:31:45,426
of a playful UI in the app.


589
00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:48,906
Another example of playful
UI is the share button.


590
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,836
These guys kind of pop up from
the bottom and then they kind


591
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,246
of bounce and go away.


592
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:56,396
So really great experience,
and then when you're done,


593
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:59,296
I love the -- what they've done.


594
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:00,346
This bear's having a good time.


595
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:04,406
I love what they've done at
the very end because you read


596
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:05,956
through this and the
news is really great,


597
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:07,706
but they've done a
great job of kind


598
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:11,096
of just gamifying this a little
bit by giving you feedback


599
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,596
on how many of the stories they
just sent you that you read.


600
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:15,736
And so while we just
swiped through them now,


601
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:18,236
it doesn't mean we read them,
but in theory you've read them,


602
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,026
and at the end you
just get told, hey,


603
00:32:20,026 --> 00:32:21,016
you've read seven of nine.


604
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:25,446
And I just find that kind
of a cool bit of feedback.


605
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:28,076
Now, this digest
that we're looking


606
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,586
at right here has
a black background


607
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,796
because it's the
end of day digest.


608
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:33,966
But we can tap the
top right-hand corner,


609
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:37,146
see the next digest
is coming in 11 hours.


610
00:32:37,146 --> 00:32:38,766
If I tap the center of
the screen, it says,


611
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,406
"Patience is a virtue."


612
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,736
I loved that the
first time I saw that.


613
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:44,886
And I can go back
across the last week


614
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:48,496
and pick one maybe a
digest that I hadn't read,


615
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:52,656
so I'll pick a morning digest,
and here the news comes in


616
00:32:52,656 --> 00:32:54,306
and it's the white background.


617
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:57,906
So little bits of attention
to detail, little attention


618
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:01,476
to detail on things like
white background for day news,

nighttime news digest.

than any of that is

But, you know, talk about
personality, you know,


665
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:53,846
this game has got
attitude, right.


666
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:57,146
So the longer I talk the more
annoyed they're going to get


667
00:35:57,146 --> 00:36:00,086
because these tiles are
individual characters.


668
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:03,596
And we can find out
who they are.


669
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:04,546
This is Trin.


670
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,716
We can tap on Thumbert, right.


671
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:11,346
Each of these guys
has got character.


672
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,616
I love Treycee.


673
00:36:13,616 --> 00:36:16,456
Hey. And you can see on
the front of these tiles


674
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,726
that they're, you know,
there's two eyes, there's a nose


675
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:22,496
or a mouth, the tiles
are constantly, you know,


676
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:26,736
they're blinking, they're
doing things with their face,


677
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:28,416
they're connecting
up with each other.


678
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,956
So the game is, you know,
you're doing ones and twos


679
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:34,076
to create threes and then you
can combine threes together.


680
00:36:34,076 --> 00:36:36,126
So let's start to move here.


681
00:36:36,126 --> 00:36:37,366
We've got to start playing here.


682
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:42,066
So we can combine one and
two with three, threes,


683
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:46,316
combining the sixes,
right, threes here, right.


684
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:56,506
And as you play, you get
this really great experience,


685
00:36:56,666 --> 00:37:00,436
you know, these tiles talking
to you, and I love this.


686
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:03,986
And this is I think what
puts this game over the top


687
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:05,996
and helps it stand
out from the crowd.


688
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:08,566
I mean, it's not just
a tile sorting game -


689
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:14,276
the personality is this extra
layer, you know, brilliant layer


690
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,846
on top of the technology.


691
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,766
So this is why we picked
this game as a winner.


692
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:22,176
It's just great game play, very
engaging, great technology use


693
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,726
and excellent personality.


694
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,406
>> Thank you very much.


695
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:27,386
Congratulations.

697
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:44,456
>> All right, so if you're
a creative professional,


698
00:37:44,756 --> 00:37:47,436
the Mac has, you
know, the chances are,


699
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,176
the Mac has been
your tool of choice.


700
00:37:49,836 --> 00:37:52,926
And, you know, across
all creative markets,


701
00:37:52,926 --> 00:37:55,206
whether professional
or consumer, you know,


702
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,856
in the creative space, it's
pretty much always been the case


703
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:04,006
that the best apps are first
on the Mac or they're Mac only.


704
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:10,796
And our winner our next winner
stays in this tradition and we'd


705
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:13,036
like to award an
ADA tonight to --


706
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,556
>> "Cinemagraph Pro"
by Flixel Photos.


707
00:38:16,516 --> 00:38:39,066
[ Music and Applause ]


708
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:40,256
>> Congratulations.


709
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:43,826
"Cinemagraph Pro" is
a professional tool


710
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:45,756
that allows you to
create living photos.


711
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,036
With its unique live masking
technology, it allows artists


712
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:51,016
to preview their
images in real time


713
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:53,776
and it creates ultrahigh
definition output


714
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:54,746
of your hybrid photos.


715
00:38:54,746 --> 00:39:02,126
>> All right, so first
thing is, you know,


716
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:05,856
we all know how compelling video
is, and we see video on the Web


717
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,776
for advertisements or for,
you know, merchandising


718
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:10,366
or in catalogs or whatever,


719
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:13,646
for things that we might be
interested in that we want


720
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:15,856
to know about, and
video is really great.


721
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:19,306
But the problem with video is
it's hard to make and it's,


722
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:21,246
you know, got a big footprint,


723
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:24,236
it's got to be brought
down, it takes bandwidth.


724
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:27,806
And so, you know, there's
a better way to do this,


725
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:28,936
as far as these guys
are concerned,


726
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:30,646
they built this tool
that's optimized


727
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:34,546
to create something they're
calling Flixels or Cinemagraphs,


728
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:37,536
which are basically living
images that are a combination


729
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,216
of a photo and a video.


730
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,776
And they benefit from being
a whole lot more lightweight


731
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,926
than video and a lot more
interesting and compelling


732
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:49,586
than photos, just still photos.


733
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:53,796
So what I want to do
here is show you first


734
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:56,456
of all just an animated gif --


735
00:39:56,556 --> 00:40:00,176
gif, sorry, animated gif that
I'm going to create in a moment,


736
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:03,646
and now this is sort of an
old file format on the Web,


737
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:04,706
but it's still prevalent.


738
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,616
And to create one of
these is difficult


739
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,706
to do what we're going
to do in a minute.


740
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:11,226
And so here's an animated gif.


741
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:12,706
And we're going to
end up with that,


742
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:16,476
and that started
with this raw video.


743
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,166
So this is just video taken
in a subway in New York.


744
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,356
And we're going to start
with that and quickly


745
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:27,706
in like three steps
create the animated gif


746
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:28,586
and create a Flixel.


747
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:32,606
So let me switch over
to "Cinemagraph Pro."


748
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:38,356
Now, what you do is you open up
the raw video that you've got,


749
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:40,936
and in this case we've got
somebody walking by on the left,


750
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:43,486
we've got the train
coming in here.


751
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:45,396
If you just look to the
left of the escalator,


752
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:48,096
you'll see as this loops,
the train's pulling in,


753
00:40:48,486 --> 00:40:50,526
and there's the light,
and it stops, right.


754
00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:51,516
So it's a very short clip.


755
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,866
But we don't want any of
those noise on the side,


756
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:55,656
we don't want any of the
reflection from the lights


757
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:58,106
and different things that are
in the station on the walls.


758
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:01,166
And so we start in the top
left corner we choose trim,


759
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,616
we pull in the trim, and
we figure out exactly,


760
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:07,736
you notice the lady on the left,
we decide where we want her


761
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:10,416
to freeze in the image
that we're going to create


762
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,406
or in the Cinemagraph that
we're going to create,


763
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,526
and we stop it there with
the left side of the trim.


764
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,916
The right side of the trim,
I'm just going to pull in here


765
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,026
and adjust just slightly
so I get the light


766
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,496
from the train coming
in to the left


767
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:23,146
of the escalator
there, you see that?


768
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:24,436
It's in there.


769
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:26,626
So that's just pulling
it in for the right side.


770
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,926
And then next is where
the magic happens.


771
00:41:28,926 --> 00:41:29,906
I'm going to go to
the mask tool,


772
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:32,806
it's a little bit too big here,
so I'm going to adjust its size.


773
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:38,556
Go down and I'm going to
mask the portion of the image


774
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,526
that of the video
that I want to keep,


775
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:44,336
everything else now becomes
basically masked out.


776
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:48,336
And then I'm going to go to loop
and decide what kind of a loop,


777
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:50,516
I've got several types
of loops that I can do.


778
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:51,856
I'll just stick with repeat.


779
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:55,416
I'm going to, you know, leave
the speed the way it is.


780
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,716
Leave the lay the way it is.


781
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:58,926
And just increase crossfade.


782
00:41:58,926 --> 00:42:01,136
Crossfade is what happens
when the video ends


783
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:03,216
and then it loops
back to the beginning.


784
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:05,176
So we'll just make
that smooth so it looks


785
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:07,056
like a continuous
movement of the escalator.


786
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:11,256
And lastly, we'll go to look
quickly at adjustments -


787
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:14,806
I can adjust all kinds of
the attributes on this video.


788
00:42:14,806 --> 00:42:17,416
But I'll just go to the
canned effects that are here,


789
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:20,416
and you can see that you can
apply these super quickly


790
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,066
to this image.


791
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:27,016
And so let's grab black
and white cold sun,


792
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:30,726
and then we'll do a
render, and we can save it


793
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:35,586
out as [inaudible] or pro
res 422, so we'll do that,


794
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:37,886
save it to the desktop.


795
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:39,786
Let's call it demo.


796
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:45,376
And what it's creating now is
it's creating this Flixel file,


797
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:49,716
this cinemagraph that the folks
at "Cinemagraph Pro" sorry


798
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:52,526
at Flixel can host on
their servers for you,


799
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:55,306
and it's super lightweight,
comes down,


800
00:42:55,306 --> 00:43:00,286
works with every browser, and
gives you that exact experience.


801
00:43:00,596 --> 00:43:04,376
And so the end result is
basically this, you know,


802
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:07,516
you can see that the woman
on the left is frozen,


803
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:09,106
everything about
the scene is frozen,


804
00:43:09,206 --> 00:43:10,946
except the one piece
that we want.


805
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,976
We did this in three
simple steps.


806
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:19,546
This app is brand new on the Mac
App Store, it's super gorgeous,


807
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:21,026
it's really streamlined.


808
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:24,726
It does one thing extremely
well, saving you 30 steps


809
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:28,666
in other tools, and they
have a really great model


810
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:30,946
for hosting these things and
serving them out to your site.


811
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:34,446
And we just love this app,
and it makes a Mac Pro sing.


812
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,606
So really well done
work, thank you.

[ Music and Applause ]


814
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:53,176
All right, we talked
about a moment ago


815
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:55,126
about how great apps
have personality,


816
00:43:55,126 --> 00:43:58,506
and earlier on I talked


817
00:43:58,506 --> 00:44:00,506
about how we judge
the apps for the ADA.


818
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:02,146
We talked about design.


819
00:44:02,146 --> 00:44:06,556
We talk about technology or we
evaluate on technology adoption.


820
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:08,066
We evaluate on innovation.


821
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:11,676
And we all know that great
apps are also innovative.


822
00:44:12,056 --> 00:44:14,776
And, you know, innovation is
hard to define, but it's sort


823
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:16,706
of that spark of brilliance.


824
00:44:17,296 --> 00:44:21,416
It's that ingredient
that if an app has it,


825
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:23,496
it just makes your
jaw drop, right.


826
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:28,216
It's the kind of thing that
makes a category, you know,


827
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:29,356

They're category-defining
apps that are innovative.

00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:33,306
They do something clever.

And, you know, you really
know it when you see it.

And we've all run
across innovative apps.

for the ADA this year

just over the top in terms

situation in a very clever way.

of games and literature.


842
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:30,926
It's a captivating thriller

in which the written
word is both your map

as well as your narrator.

Entwining story with puzzle and
blending puzzle with novella,

Just bear with me here.

We're in landscape mode,
you're holding the iPad,


851
00:45:59,636 --> 00:46:01,746
this is a narrative that
you're reading through,


852
00:46:01,746 --> 00:46:03,286
it's a book that
you read through.


853
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:05,186
And we're starting
sort of halfway


854
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:06,696
through the first chapter.


855
00:46:07,146 --> 00:46:10,486
But as you move here, you can
see this parallax effect behind


856
00:46:10,486 --> 00:46:11,496
these images, yeah.


857
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:14,896
And that is pervasive
through the app.


858
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:20,806
But not only are the words
onscreen things that you read


859
00:46:20,806 --> 00:46:24,796
to tell you the story, but
you're also going to get clues


860
00:46:24,996 --> 00:46:26,586
about the puzzle that
you have to solve,


861
00:46:26,586 --> 00:46:28,096
because fundamentally,
this is a game.


862
00:46:28,896 --> 00:46:30,786
But it's a combination
novel game.


863
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:34,856
And so you're reading along,
you're looking at these photos,


864
00:46:34,856 --> 00:46:37,176
they do really interesting
interactions,


865
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:40,686
and they have a great
sound system built in.


866
00:46:40,686 --> 00:46:43,546
So sometimes you approach
sounds and, you know,


867
00:46:43,546 --> 00:46:46,846
they'll become louder and
softer as you're near them.


868
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:48,916
Here we've run into
an interactive,

an interactive piece, which at
the moment doesn't do anything.


870
00:46:52,606 --> 00:46:55,186
But we're going to need it at
some point to solve the puzzle.


871
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,946
And we move on here and
you'll see that, you know,

00:46:57,946 --> 00:47:01,566
while I'm reading this text, the
text is actually doing all kinds


873
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:02,506
of interesting things.


874
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:04,256
So I'm moving along,
don't worry about the fact


875
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:06,356
that it's portrait up there
because we're going to go

00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,706
in different directions
here in a moment.

And you see that I'm
just scrolling left


878
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:12,546
but the text is actually
moving things.

floor study, I keep going,

can interact with, you know,

in or something.

I've got a choice, I can go up

going here a little bit.

to get to a point

We go here, I have to turn
the device this way to read.


891
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,076
I've got to turn
the device this way-


892
00:47:54,076 --> 00:47:55,886
of course it's screwing
up our projection.

There we pass that, and
now we're going here,

we're going this way,
we're reading the text.

Now we're going to
flip this way.

You can apply effects
to the images.

00:52:00,896 --> 00:52:05,866
You know, so this is
pretty gorgeous photography.

00:52:05,866 --> 00:52:09,316
And it's just laid out in
such a really compelling way


964
00:52:09,646 --> 00:52:15,146
that makes it really
digestible and easy to consume.


965
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:17,866
And then laying out text
on it is super easy.


966
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:20,616
Anyway, and so when
you're done with a story,


967
00:52:20,616 --> 00:52:22,286
you can just pinch
to get out of it.


968
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:26,086
They're using, you know,
UI effects and UI dynamics


969
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,986

970
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:31,186
Let me go into one
that's got some video,


971
00:52:31,186 --> 00:52:32,476
so let's go into this story

who went to Rwanda.


973
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:39,436

know, much larger photos,


974
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:42,516
a lot more texts, these
individual portraits.


975
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:45,186
And quickly here we're
going to get to a video,


976
00:52:45,436 --> 00:52:47,146
just embedded right in,
you don't have to tap


977
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:49,516
to start playing the
video, it just does


978
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:54,096
as it pulls the majority
of it onscreen, right.


979
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:55,206
You keep reading.


980
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:57,836
Again, it's a much more
significant, deeper,


981
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:00,766
more emotional story that's
being told here, right.


982
00:53:01,776 --> 00:53:06,406
And so these are being created
by chefs, by fashion designers,


983

by photojournalists
around the world,


984
00:53:08,746 --> 00:53:11,766
and families are creating them,
individuals are creating them.


985
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:16,336
So one of the things about this
app is it lets you create one


986
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:20,876
of these books or these
stories sorry super easily.


987
00:53:20,876 --> 00:53:22,746
So you just tap the
create button.


988
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,716
We're going to add
from the photo library.


989
00:53:24,756 --> 00:53:30,626
Let's say we went to the lake,
we import these 14 images,


990
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:34,676
and immediately they're
laid out in the format


991
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:36,466
that the app provides.


992
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:45,286
So let's say, you know, trip
to the lake, great memories,


993
00:53:45,796 --> 00:53:49,946
and we say done on that.

00:53:50,236 --> 00:53:54,196
Okay, so now we're
down in the basic view,


995
00:53:54,196 --> 00:53:56,466
which is thumbnail view, but
it's like I want to do more


996
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,956
than this, I want to
make something compelling


997
00:53:57,956 --> 00:53:59,746
like the Chicago one
I saw a moment ago.


998
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:03,196
So you could say, well, you
know what, this image here


999
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:05,016
of the cyclist is pretty cool.


1000
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:07,786
So we just tap and
drag, make that larger.


1001
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,876
This one of her on the
tree stump is pretty cool,


1002
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,296
so we can just tap
and drag that.


1003
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:16,806
We can double tap and you know,
and crop it in the way we want.


1004
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:19,646
Go around, make something
really big, like this,


1005
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:21,476
everything else moves
out of the way.


1006
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:23,516
Great feedback through
animation.


1007
00:54:23,936 --> 00:54:26,536
And you just go on and on,
and you can add the texts,


1008
00:54:26,536 --> 00:54:27,876
you can create the
breaks you want,


1009
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:31,446
and then you can publish this
out to the Storehouse community.


1010
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:34,626
And if people are following you,
they're going to see your story.


1011
00:54:34,626 --> 00:54:36,986
In this case I'm just going
to save it as a draft.


1012
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:40,766
But this is just such a
compelling app, just to browse

through these stories and
see what people are posting.


1014
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:47,656
And they are far more
significant and more meaningful


1015
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:50,896
and more emotionally charged
than just something small


1016

that we put out to the world


1017

but very different.

the app just does
everything right technically.


1048

It is optimized, you
know, to the nth degree.

They're using Core Audio.

They're, you know, leveraging
all of the technologies

that are appropriate and
relevant for this app.


1053
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:09,426
And the performance
is just stunning.


1054
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:12,806
One of the first things
you'll notice in the app, too,


1055
00:57:12,806 --> 00:57:16,336
and you're hearing it now is
just this ambient music that's


1056
00:57:16,336 --> 00:57:17,316
playing in the background.


1057
00:57:17,526 --> 00:57:21,666

music was the same guy

sounds for an ADA winner

tap on these stars,

a small sound,

a large sound.

can almost make your own music

because of the shortness

of the cords I'm not
going to do that.


1074
00:58:17,146 --> 00:58:18,776
You can lift it up and
as soon as it detects


1075
00:58:18,776 --> 00:58:22,496
that you're looking at the
sky, it activates the compass


1076
00:58:22,496 --> 00:58:25,376
and gyroscope and so now
you can pan around the sky

to go search for something

which is the Space Station.

out here and look

00:58:52,806 --> 00:58:55,816
at the different part
of the night sky.


1087
00:58:55,816 --> 00:58:58,436
One of the things you can
do is you could just --


1088
00:58:58,436 --> 00:59:01,636
because of the light
pollution that's around us


1089
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:04,746
when we're outside, you can
actually just tap two fingers


1090
00:59:04,746 --> 00:59:09,196
onscreen and drag up or
down to adjust the amount


1091
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:13,426
of stars onscreen in "Sky Guide"
relative to what you're seeing,


1092
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:15,996
you know, when you're
outside, so that's kind


1093
00:59:15,996 --> 00:59:18,216
of cool, so it's a good match.


1094
00:59:18,216 --> 00:59:21,246
You can also learn a
lot about the night sky


1095
00:59:21,326 --> 00:59:25,376
by leveraging a tool inside of
the app, and this is the loop.


1096
00:59:25,636 --> 00:59:30,516
So this lets you see different
spectra beyond what's visible

to the human eye.


1098
00:59:31,336 --> 00:59:32,646
And so you just bring
up this loop,


1099
00:59:32,686 --> 00:59:34,246
you can drag it around the sky.


1100
00:59:34,776 --> 00:59:38,816

and move through, you know,

and you can leave it there


1102

sky and look at different things


1103

you wouldn't know about

01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:19,356
And I don't know where
the idea came from,


1157
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:23,146
we'll have to hear the
story someday, but it is -


1158
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:26,026
they just set out to
do something so big


1159
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:27,636
and the result is amazing.


1160
01:03:27,706 --> 01:03:30,536
So what you're doing is you're
taking this little Princess Ida


1161
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:33,066
and you've got to get her to
the top of these, you know,


1162
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:34,316
to the top of the scenes.


1163
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,936
In this case the top
of the tower there.


1164
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:40,016
But we're looking at this
very Escheresque 3-D model,


1165
01:03:40,246 --> 01:03:41,726
and a lot of things
don't line up.


1166
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:44,876
Anyway, so we'll
figure it out as we go.


1167
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:48,576
No. 1, you know, you can
interact with objects onscreen.


1168
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,566
So this one's pretty
straightforward - let's just tap


1169
01:03:50,566 --> 01:03:51,756
and tell her where to go.


1170
01:03:52,466 --> 01:03:55,156
She's going to go up here,
we're going to put her up here.


1171
01:03:55,156 --> 01:03:56,676
But now, now what do we do?


1172
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:01,716
But you get these hints onscreen
that so you can turn this


1173
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:06,156
and so we'll walk around here,
we're going to walk her around,


1174
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:09,266
flip this around, and now
she's got to go and step


1175
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:11,276
on this special platform,
which is now going


1176
01:04:11,276 --> 01:04:13,236
to deconstruct things.


1177
01:04:13,746 --> 01:04:16,346
But you know, when you
look at this, okay,


1178
01:04:16,346 --> 01:04:17,326
now where's she going to go?


1179
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:19,966
She can't climb that
center pole.


1180
01:04:19,966 --> 01:04:22,646
She can't you know,
what are we going to do?


1181
01:04:22,646 --> 01:04:28,586
But what's just so cool about
this app is that once you start


1182
01:04:28,586 --> 01:04:30,126
to interact with these objects,


1183
01:04:30,796 --> 01:04:34,486
you realize like look what's
going on here, you didn't think


1184
01:04:34,486 --> 01:04:36,946
that that top bar
was the same height


1185
01:04:36,946 --> 01:04:38,226
as the other walkway, right.


1186
01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:40,286
But as you start to
rotate it around,


1187
01:04:40,286 --> 01:04:46,356
they've just done this great job
of showing what you're doing.

[ Applause ]


1189
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:52,686
You know, it's like that
you know, those stairs


1190
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:55,316
that just never end, right,
it's exactly that experience.


1191
01:04:55,786 --> 01:04:58,486
So here you turn around,
now she's going to get


1192
01:04:58,486 --> 01:05:00,926
to the final destination, right.


1193
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:04,376
And so she gets there, we
get this path that appears,


1194
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,086
and now we get onto
this next level.


1195
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:10,076
So she's going to
walk around here.


1196
01:05:10,886 --> 01:05:13,166
And this just goes
on and on and on.


1197
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:17,286
And it's just so awesome,
because in this level here,


1198
01:05:17,286 --> 01:05:20,366
she suddenly learns to
walk sideways and walk


1199
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:21,276
on different surfaces.


1200
01:05:21,276 --> 01:05:24,096
So here she's going up here.


1201
01:05:24,156 --> 01:05:25,926
We're going to walk
her around here.


1202
01:05:27,236 --> 01:05:29,246
And just listen to this
soundtrack that's going


1203
01:05:29,246 --> 01:05:30,086
on behind the scenes.


1204
01:05:30,086 --> 01:05:33,266
Now you're like what is
happening here, right?


1205
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,636
But if we turn let's see -
can I remember how to do this?


1206
01:05:37,386 --> 01:05:39,876
Well, let's just end the
demo there because - oh,


1207
01:05:39,876 --> 01:05:41,316
I know what to do, I know
what to do, that's right.


1208
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:44,446
I want to get to the backside of
this thing, no I can't do that.


1209
01:05:44,446 --> 01:05:47,426
I can't remember, it's okay,
you've got to play the game.


1210
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:49,776
