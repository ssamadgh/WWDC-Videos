00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:26,576
[ Applause ]


2
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:27,486
>> Thank you.


3
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,226
Welcome everybody.


4
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:30,606
Good morning.


5
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:31,466
It's early.


6
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:32,386
I hope you had your coffee.


7
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:33,496
We have a lot to talk about


8
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:33,736
today.


9
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:35,546
Welcome to what's new in


10
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:35,986
HomeKit.


11
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:39,456
In iOS 11, watchOS 4 and tvvOS


12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:39,886
11.


13
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:42,476
We have a ton of great features


14
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,346
and enhancements we'd like to


15
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,226
talk to you today about.


16
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,876
First, we will be providing an


17
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:49,706
overview of HomeKit as a


18
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:50,176
framework.


19
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:53,166
Second, we're going to be


20
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:53,866
talking about some of the


21
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,106
updates and enhancements to the


22
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,886
HomeKit framework in iOS 11.


23
00:00:57,436 --> 00:01:00,376
And Praveen will be sharing some


24
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:01,826
exciting news about our


25
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:02,716
accessory ecosystem.


26
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:10,076
The HomeKit framework allows


27
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:12,216
your apps to easily set up and


28
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:14,146
control your HomeKit


29
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:14,886
accessories.


30
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,886
HomeKit provides a central store


31
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:19,746
for the configuration of your


32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,956
home, including rooms,


33
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:24,926
accessories, automations and


34
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:25,136
more.


35
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:27,866
This configuration is


36
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,096
synchronized across all of your


37
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,816
apps and devices.


38
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:33,946
And HomeKit is deeply integrated


39
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,976
in iOS, Watch OS and TV OS.


40
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:47,846
You can control your accessories


41
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,916
and scenes directly with your


42
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:54,466
voice, using Siri, or using the


43
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,776
Home app, you can control all of


44
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:00,726
your accessories from any of


45
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:01,406
your devices.


46
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:08,026
And with just a swipe and a tap,


47
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:09,256
you can control your favorite


48
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,396
scenes and accessories right


49
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:12,986
from Control Center, and it has


50
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:15,106
really never been easier for you


51
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:16,976
to control your home.


52
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,906
And with an Apple TV or iPad as


53
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:23,816
your Home Hub, you can control


54
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:25,396
your accessories from just about


55
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,746
anywhere in the world.


56
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:29,506
And we are happy to say that in


57
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:30,906
addition to being a fantastic


58
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:33,156
speaker, the Home Pod will also


59
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:34,786
be added as a Home Hub later


60
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:35,396
this year.


61
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:39,316
And with a compatible home hub,


62
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:42,396
your home can be automated via


63
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:44,106
time and event-based triggers.


64
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:47,806
And with over 70 accessory


65
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:50,136
manufacturers, either bringing


66
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,846
accessories to market or already


67
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:52,906
have accessories on the market,


68
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,556
the number of HomeKit


69
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,006
accessories continues to grow


70
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:57,036
month over month.


71
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:58,566
It is super exciting.


72
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:05,436
We have a number of new features


73
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,786
to talk about in iOS 11 and


74
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,666
today we are going to focus on


75
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,536
event triggers.


76
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:14,716
Today, I'm happy to say that we


77
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:18,316
are introducing New Events, New


78
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:23,186
Conditions, support for End


79
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:27,016
Events, and Recurrences.


80
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,446
And finally we are talking about


81
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:33,176
the enhancement for Mutable


82
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:33,806
Events.


83
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,336
But before we dive into what is


84
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,196
new, I'd like to do a quick


85
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,916
overview of Event Triggers.


86
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:45,826
Event Triggers center around


87
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,406
events.


88
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,656
When an event fires, it


89
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,746
activates a trigger, and you can


90
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:53,306
have one or more events


91
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:54,866
associated to an event trigger.


92
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,856
We support two different types


93
00:03:57,886 --> 00:03:59,086
of events today.


94
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:01,666
The first, when the state of an


95
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,506
accessory changes, such as


96
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,646
opening of a door, or turning on


97
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,706
a light.


98
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,526
Second, we support when a device


99
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,596
enters or leaves a geo region.


100
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:19,396
And when an event fires, and the


101
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,185
event trigger activates, it


102
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:23,056
executes one or more scenes.


103
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,606
And a scene is comprised of one


104
00:04:25,606 --> 00:04:27,356
or more actions, such as


105
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:30,186
unlocking my door, or turning on


106
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:30,786
my lights.


107
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,266
And you can gate the execution


108
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,436
of a scene when a trigger is


109
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,486
activated via conditions.


110
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:43,886
And we support a number of


111
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:45,306
different types of conditions.


112
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:49,606
First, based on the current


113
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:50,446
time.


114
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,646
Second, based on the current


115
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,126
state of an accessory.


116
00:04:57,536 --> 00:04:59,746
Excuse me.


117
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:04,586
And last, based on the relative


118
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:07,876
time to significant events, such


119
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:13,026
as sunrise and sunset.


120
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:20,366
Now, as an example, When we


121
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:26,076
arrive home and we open our


122
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,856
door, and in this case, opening


123
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:29,356
the door is our event.


124
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:33,816
And after dark, this is our


125
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:34,336
condition.


126
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:37,226
And it is based on a significant


127
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:38,266
event of sunset.


128
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,506
We want to say execute our


129
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:43,156
arrive home scene.


130
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:45,996
And that is an event trigger.


131
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:49,926
And we have a number of


132
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:51,856
enhancements and new features


133
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:52,626
for event triggers.


134
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,206
The first of which is support


135
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:57,886
for date-based events, via


136
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:58,716
HMCalendarEvent.


137
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,766
This provides an improved


138
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:03,846
scheduling capability over HM


139
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:04,666
timer triggers.


140
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:06,616
You can now take advantage of


141
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,526
all the features of the


142
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,936
triggers, such as conditions,


143
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,176
and some of the other features


144
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,366
we are going to be talking about


145
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:12,726
shortly.


146
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:16,476
And we support dates based on


147
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,876
year, month, day, and hour


148
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:20,846
minute combination.


149
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:24,316
Now, as an example, let's go


150
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,586
ahead and create an event


151
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,916
trigger which executes at 5:30


152
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,316
p.m. every day.


153
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,786
First, we are going to create


154
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:33,806
our date component.


155
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:35,586
In this case, we are going to


156
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:37,896
set two properties, the hour


157
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,756
property to 17, indicates 5:00


158
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:43,376
p.m. Second, we are going to set


159
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,046
the minute property to 30, and


160
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:47,416
this indicates 30 minutes after


161
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:52,566
5:00 p.m. We then simply create


162
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:56,206
our HMCalendarEvent, and we


163
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,106
specify our recently created


164
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,116
date component.


165
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:02,256
Now, we have just created an


166
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,466
event which will fire at 5:30


167
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:06,376
every day.


168
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:09,196
We then simply create our


169
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:14,606
HMEventTrigger, and we're going


170
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:15,596
to give it a friendly name.


171
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:17,066
In this case, we are going to


172
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,046
call it Every day at 5:30 p.m.,


173
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,346
and then we specify our


174
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:22,926
collection of events.


175
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,316
In this case, a single event,


176
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,086
our HMCalendarEvent.


177
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:29,226
And now, in iOS 11, it is that


178
00:07:29,226 --> 00:07:30,556
easy to create event-based


179
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:32,366
triggers based on times of the


180
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:34,226
day or specific dates.


181
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,716
We have also added support for


182
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,986
significant time events, via


183
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,446
HMSignificantTimeEvent.


184
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,036
This activates on significant


185
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:48,816
events, such as sunrise, and


186
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:49,186
sunset.


187
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:52,726
And we support a relative time


188
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:53,846
offset to these significant


189
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:56,276
events, both positive and


190
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:56,626
negative.


191
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:00,266
And this means you can schedule


192
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,396
events to fire, say one hour


193
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:03,806
after sunrise.


194
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:06,376
Now, let's go ahead and create


195
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:07,546
another event trigger.


196
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:10,266
This time, we want it to fire at


197
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:13,876
sunrise every day.


198
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:19,396
There we go.


199
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:21,326
First, we create our


200
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,556
HMSignificantTimeEvent, and we


201
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,586
are going to specify sunrise as


202
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,236
our significant event.


203
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:31,416
And we also specify our offset


204
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:32,206
to be nil.


205
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:36,035
Now, this indicates that we want


206
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:38,616
our event to fire at sunrise,


207
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,666
not before, and not after.


208
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,716
We then simply create our


209
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:44,516
HMEventTrigger, same as we did


210
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:47,406
before, and we specify this time


211
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:49,166
our sunrise event as a single


212
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,366
firing event.


213
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:58,196
We've also added a convenience


214
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:01,636
to iOS 11 to allow you to easily


215
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,696
create a condition which is


216
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:05,606
between two significant events,


217
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,306
and note, that because these


218
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:09,426
take significant events, they


219
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,966
support a relative time offset.


220
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:14,166
So, for instance, I can create a


221
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,686
condition which gates the


222
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:18,776
execution of my scene from say


223
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:21,336
one hour after sunset, to one


224
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,756
hour before sunrise.


225
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,136
This is available on


226
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:27,906
HMEventTrigger via predicate for


227
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:29,486
evaluating trigger occurring


228
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,686
between significant events.


229
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:37,596
In iOS 11, we have also added


230
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:40,676
support for creating a event


231
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:42,056
which executes when a


232
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,586
characteristic value crosses a


233
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:46,266
threshold value.


234
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:50,836
Now, for example, we could


235
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,756
execute when the temperature


236
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:55,956
rises above 76 degrees in our


237
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:57,326
home.


238
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:00,856
We could also execute when the


239
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:03,396
temperature drops below 68


240
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,636
degrees in our home.


241
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,166
And finally, we could execute


242
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,146
when the temperature is between


243
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,756
68 and say 76 degrees in our


244
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:12,976
home.


245
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,856
Now, let's go ahead and build an


246
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:16,296
example.


247
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:18,736
We want to create an event


248
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,546
trigger which executes when the


249
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:21,886
temperature in our home rises


250
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,666
above 76 degrees.


251
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,306
To do this, we first create an


252
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:28,116
HMNumberRange.


253
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,156
Now, note, HMNumberRange is what


254
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:32,516
specifies our range between a


255
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,216
minimum and maximum value.


256
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,056
And we have provided two


257
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:37,786
convenience initializers for you


258
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:38,996
to create a range within a


259
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:41,736
minimum or a maximum value only.


260
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,426
In this case, we are providing


261
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,846
the minimum value to be 76.


262
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:49,076
And our maximum value in this


263
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:50,806
case is an arbitrary large


264
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:52,326
number, let's say it is positive


265
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:52,756
infinity.


266
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:55,646
We then create our HM


267
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:57,156
Characteristic Threshold Range


268
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:57,526
Event.


269
00:10:58,476 --> 00:10:59,486
And we specify our target


270
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:00,216
characteristic.


271
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,276
In this case, it is a


272
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:03,426
temperature characteristic,


273
00:11:03,426 --> 00:11:04,876
which can be a temperature


274
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,386
sensor, or it can be a


275
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:06,906
thermostat.


276
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:09,906
We then simply provide our


277
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,456
threshold range, which was our


278
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:13,606
recently created range of 76


279
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:14,266
degrees.


280
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:17,686
We then, as we've done before,


281
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:20,036
create our HMEventTrigger, and


282
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:22,946
this time, we specify our single


283
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:24,936
firing event, which is our


284
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:28,076
characteristic threshold range


285
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:28,396
event.


286
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:32,146
There we go.


287
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:36,296
Now, the state of our homes are


288
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:37,826
often tied to whether or not


289
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,626
users are in or out of the home.


290
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:42,856
For instance, I don't like to


291
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:44,536
run my air conditioning or have


292
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,326
lights on in my home when no one


293
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:47,926
is home.


294
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,286
I am happy to say that in iOS


295
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:52,396
11, this is now supported via


296
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:53,566
HMPresenceEvent [applause].


297
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:57,816
It is super cool.


298
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:58,526
You are going to love it.


299
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,216
We support a number of different


300
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:01,966
types of events.


301
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:05,436
Excuse me.


302
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,806
There we go.


303
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,396
First, when the current user,


304
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,996
that is the device that we are


305
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,396
talking about, arrives home.


306
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:23,186
On the other hand, we can also


307
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:24,466
support when the current user


308
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:25,956
leaves home.


309
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,786
Now, these two replace, or don't


310
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:31,576
replace, but they augment


311
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,546
HMLocationEvents, but instead of


312
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,236
tracking a single device, they


313
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:36,356
now track a user.


314
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:40,286
We've also added support for


315
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:41,586
multiple users of the home, in


316
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:42,776
fact, all users of the home.


317
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,876
For instance, we support when


318
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:47,576
the last user leaves home.


319
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:50,496
Now note, this indicates that


320
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,106
your home is now unoccupied.


321
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,126
It is a good time to do things


322
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,756
such as turn off the lights,


323
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:57,526
turn down the air conditioning,


324
00:12:58,586 --> 00:12:59,586
even lock the doors.


325
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:03,926
And finally, of course, we


326
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,316
support when the first user


327
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:05,996
arrives home.


328
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:07,676
And this indicates that your


329
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,936
home is now occupied, and in


330
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,396
this case, it may be good for


331
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:13,026
you to do things like turn down


332
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,606
the air conditioning, turn on


333
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,506
some lights, unlock the doors.


334
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,936
Now, let's go ahead and build


335
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,336
this last example, where we


336
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:21,916
create an event trigger which


337
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,286
executes when the first user


338
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:23,956
arrives home.


339
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,286
First, we create our


340
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:30,696
HMPresenceEvent, and we are


341
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:31,906
going to specify our presence


342
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:34,466
type to be any user at home.


343
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,726
Now, this indicates that we want


344
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:40,526
our event to fire when the first


345
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:41,826
user arrives home.


346
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:44,816
We then, just as we have done


347
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,686
before, create an


348
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,886
HMEventTrigger, and we specify


349
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:50,446
our single firing event, in this


350
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,346
case, which is our presence


351
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:52,786
event.


352
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,716
And you probably know what I am


353
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:57,076
going to say, but it really is


354
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:00,116
that easy in iOS 11 to create


355
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,236
user presence based automations,


356
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,946
and it is super cool, and we are


357
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,306
super excited for you to try it


358
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:06,826
out, and provide some enhanced


359
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,366
features to your client, or your


360
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:11,416
app users, excuse me.


361
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,796
Now, we didn't stop there.


362
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:17,216
We have also added support for


363
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,656
user presence conditions.


364
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,676
Now, for example, let's say that


365
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,986
normally we want to execute our


366
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:27,876
good morning scene when we wake


367
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,716
up, or when the sun rises.


368
00:14:30,226 --> 00:14:34,316
But it doesn't make sense for us


369
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:35,816
to execute this if no one is


370
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:36,016
home.


371
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,726
In iOS 11, you can now gate the


372
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,806
execution of scenes based on


373
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:44,106
user presence via user presence


374
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:44,806
conditions.


375
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:49,856
This is available on


376
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:53,516
HMEventTrigger via predicate for


377
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:55,146
evaluating trigger with


378
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:55,836
presence.


379
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,066
And note that it takes a


380
00:14:58,116 --> 00:14:58,876
presence event.


381
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:05,006
Now, let's go ahead and add a


382
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:07,006
presence condition to our


383
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,996
previous sunrise event trigger


384
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,776
and take a look at what it looks


385
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:14,986
like.


386
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:18,236
First, we are going to create


387
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:20,276
our significant time event,


388
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:21,596
which is our sunrise event,


389
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,326
specifying no offset, same as we


390
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:24,846
did before.


391
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,106
We then create our


392
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:30,576
HMPresenceEvent, again same as


393
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,756
we did before, specifying any


394
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:33,826
user at home.


395
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:37,626
We then create our condition via


396
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:41,356
HMEventTrigger, predicate for


397
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,376
evaluating trigger with


398
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:45,206
presence, and we specify our


399
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,066
presenceEvent.


400
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,046
And then we create our


401
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:49,626
HMEventTrigger.


402
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,976
Now, this time, we are going to


403
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,176
specify our condition as the


404
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:57,006
predicate for the event trigger.


405
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:05,746
And now, and now we have just


406
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:07,586
created an event trigger which


407
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,916
will fire every day at sunrise,


408
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:11,556
but will only execute the


409
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,336
associated scenes when there is


410
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:14,526
a user at home.


411
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,156
If you're like me, we often want


412
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:23,926
to execute a trigger, but only


413
00:16:23,926 --> 00:16:24,606
temporarily.


414
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:29,516
For instance, when I open my


415
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:32,846
patio door at night, I want my


416
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:36,266
patio light to turn on, but


417
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,866
after say 10 minutes, I want my


418
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,436
patio light to turn off


419
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:41,686
automatically.


420
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:46,016
And this is now possible in iOS


421
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:49,626
11 via EndEvents


422
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,689
[ Applause ]


423
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,752
.


424
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:54,936
EndEvents are available on


425
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:57,726
HMEventTrigger, and they return


426
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,666
a collection of HMEvents.


427
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:04,736
And you can update the existing


428
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:07,866
events or EndEvents for an event


429
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:10,036
trigger via update end events


430
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:10,945
with completionHandler.


431
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:22,675
Now, we have added a new event


432
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:24,195
for EndEvents.


433
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:25,866
HMDurationEvent.


434
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:27,896
This allows you to specify a


435
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,976
time interval from the trigger's


436
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:32,406
execution time, at which point


437
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:36,116
to end the event.


438
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,646
Now, on a similar note, we often


439
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,596
want a trigger to execute only


440
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:44,656
on certain days of the week, and


441
00:17:44,656 --> 00:17:46,086
this is now possible via


442
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:47,366
Recurrences.


443
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:50,576
Recurrences are available on


444
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:53,676
HMEventTrigger, and they return


445
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,516
an optional collection of date


446
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:57,246
components which specify the


447
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:58,786
days of the week for which the


448
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,136
trigger is active.


449
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:03,256
And you can update an existing


450
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,896
event trigger with new


451
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,246
occurrences via Update


452
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:08,066
Recurrences with


453
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:08,976
completionHandler.


454
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:13,606
Now, as an example, I like to


455
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,016
get up just a little later on


456
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:16,126
the weekends, as I'm sure many


457
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:16,866
of you do.


458
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:18,756
So I don't want my Good Morning


459
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,616
Scene to automatically execute


460
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,146
an hour after sunrise.


461
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:25,606
Instead, I'd like to use Siri to


462
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,756
go ahead and say, "Good


463
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:27,066
morning."


464
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,376
So let's go ahead and gate our


465
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:31,386
previous sunrise event trigger


466
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:34,856
to only execute during the week,


467
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:36,516
Monday through Friday.


468
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:41,546
To do this, we create our


469
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:43,826
HMSignificantTimeEvent, same as


470
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:44,486
we did before.


471
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:51,176
Then we create our collection of


472
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:52,106
DateComponents.


473
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:53,616
We are going to call these


474
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:57,656
weekdays, then for each day of


475
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:59,826
the week, Monday through Friday,


476
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,016
we create a new DateComponent,


477
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,306
and we specify the weekday


478
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:04,786
property to be the current day


479
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:06,696
of the week, then we simply add


480
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:08,476
this to our weekdays collection.


481
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:12,566
And then when we create our


482
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:15,666
HmeventTrigger, we specify our


483
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,956
collection of recurrences, which


484
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,676
are date components, as


485
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,526
recurrences are of our


486
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:22,066
EventTrigger.


487
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,386
And this allows us to restrict


488
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:28,076
the execution of event triggers


489
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:34,506
based on the day of the week.


490
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,826
But furthermore, we also


491
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:38,586
sometimes want to create an


492
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,326
event trigger which only


493
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:42,336
executes once, and then auto


494
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:43,206
disables itself.


495
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:48,896
This is now possible via Execute


496
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,266
Once.


497
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:54,286
As an example, you may want to


498
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,096
create an event trigger that


499
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,826
executes tomorrow at sunset, but


500
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:00,946
you don't want it to repeat.


501
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:04,336
It is a great feature, and we


502
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,266
are excited for you to try it


503
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:05,416
out.


504
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,426
This is available on


505
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:10,916
HMEventTrigger via the Execute


506
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,456
Once property, and you can


507
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:16,106
update an existing or new event


508
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,076
trigger to only execute one time


509
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:20,436
via update executeOnce with


510
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,296
completionHandler.


511
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:28,086
The last, we've heard your


512
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:29,966
feedback and we understand how


513
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,766
difficult it currently is to


514
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:34,556
update existing events on an


515
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:35,216
event trigger.


516
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:37,816
Let's take an example.


517
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:39,676
If you were building an app and


518
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:42,066
updating a single event, you


519
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:43,826
first had to copy the properties


520
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,146
of that event in your


521
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:47,646
application, then you had to


522
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,016
allow the user to modify that


523
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:49,346
event.


524
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:51,866
Once the user completed their


525
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,766
changes, you had to create a


526
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,456
brand new HMEvent with the new


527
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,816
properties then you had to


528
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:01,926
remove the existing event, via


529
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:02,906
removeEvent with


530
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:03,756
completionHandler.


531
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:06,286
And then add the new event via


532
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:08,346
addEvent with completionHandler.


533
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:10,406
And this is a number of steps to


534
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,816
update just one single event.


535
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:15,256
And so in iOS 11 we have made it


536
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:17,246
simpler via a single method


537
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,446
updateEvents with


538
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,256
completionHandler.


539
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,576
Now this takes a collection of


540
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,576
HMEvents which represent the new


541
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,086
events for an event trigger.


542
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:28,916
And we have also added support


543
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:32,696
for all defined HMEvents for


544
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:33,596
mutable copies.


545
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,666
So what does this mean?


546
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:37,786
You can now simply take a


547
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:39,646
mutable copy of an existing


548
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:42,556
event, make any changes the user


549
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,576
has requested, and then commit


550
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,326
those changes via updateOnce


551
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:47,616
with completionHandler.


552
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,026
Let's go ahead and see an


553
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:51,616
example of updating our previous


554
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:54,056
sunrise event trigger to execute


555
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:56,696
30 minutes after sunrise.


556
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:02,436
First, we get our existing


557
00:22:02,436 --> 00:22:03,286
HMEvent.


558
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,736
We are going to-this will return


559
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:07,386
an object of type


560
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:08,626
HMSignificantTimeEvent.


561
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:14,036
We then simply create a


562
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:16,016
mutableCopy, which will return


563
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:16,776
an object of type


564
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,796
HMMutableSignificantTimeEvent.


565
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:23,336
We can then update the offset of


566
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:26,066
our sunrise event, by creating a


567
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:26,896
new Date Component.


568
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:29,026
We specify the minute property


569
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,516
to 30, to indicated 30 minutes


570
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,436
after the significant event, and


571
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:34,796
then simply update the offset of


572
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,386
our mutableSunriseEvent to our


573
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:38,136
new date component.


574
00:22:38,976 --> 00:22:41,626
Now note, we haven't actually


575
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,806
changed our event trigger yet.


576
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:45,716
It will still execute at


577
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,646
sunrise.


578
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,856
So move our event trigger to 30


579
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:52,176
minutes after sunrise, we simply


580
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:54,576
need to call UpdateEvents, with


581
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:56,136
completionHandler, providing a


582
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,676
collection of new events.


583
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,106
In this case, we simply pass our


584
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:01,796
single mutableSunriseEvent.


585
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:04,936
And now in iOS 11, it is that


586
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:06,686
easy for your apps to update


587
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,256
existing events on an


588
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:08,976
HMEventTrigger.


589
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:17,906
We've covered a tone of new


590
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:19,706
topics and enhancements to


591
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:21,246
HMEventTriggers.


592
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,846
First, we have added support for


593
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:26,756
new events, supporting dates.


594
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,866
Significant events,


595
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:31,806
characteristic threshold range,


596
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:33,596
and user presence.


597
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,586
We have added new conditions,


598
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:38,526
supporting significant time


599
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:41,316
ranges and user presence.


600
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:47,776
We have added support, excuse


601
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,566
me, for end events, which allow


602
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:53,466
you to specify temporary event


603
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,536
triggers which can


604
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,046
auto-deactivate after a


605
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:58,996
specified amount of time.


606
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,486
We've added support for


607
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:03,086
recurrences which allow you to


608
00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:04,936
specify when your event trigger


609
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:09,256
will be active and finally, we


610
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:10,646
have added support for mutable


611
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:13,136
events for all defined event


612
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:15,986
types, which makes it easier for


613
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,896
your applications in iOS 11 to


614
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:20,506
update existing HMEventTriggers.


615
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:25,066
And now, I'd like to hand it off


616
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,416
to Praveen, to give you some


617
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:28,146
exciting updates about our


618
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:28,996
accessory ecosystem.


619
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:30,166
Praveen?


620
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:37,566
[ Applause ]


621
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:38,766
>> Thanks Matt.


622
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:39,596
Good morning everyone.


623
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,796
My name is Praveen Chegondi, and


624
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:43,686
I am here to share with you new


625
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:45,146
protocol features and


626
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,196
enhancements that are in iOS 11.


627
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,466
I have a few exciting topics to


628
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:49,976
talk about today.


629
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:58,876
I am going to be sharing some


630
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,546
great news about what we are


631
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,666
doing with the HomeKit accessory


632
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:03,896
protocol specification.


633
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,276
I am also going to be talking


634
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:10,846
about enhancement to the HomeKit


635
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:15,416
accessory protocol.


636
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:17,036
Supportive new accessory


637
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,346
categories in iOS 11.


638
00:25:20,096 --> 00:25:21,356
Addition to the authentication


639
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,396
process for HomeKit accessories.


640
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:27,866
And finally, we will be rounding


641
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:29,666
up with improvements to the


642
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,686
self-certification process for


643
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:32,866
our MFi licensees.


644
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:41,376
Let's start off with a quick


645
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:42,916
overview of the HomeKit


646
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:43,856
Accessory Protocol


647
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:44,596
Specification.


648
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:53,256
The HomeKit Accessory Protocol


649
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:56,076
Specification describes how a


650
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,466
controller, which is an Apple


651
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,286
device, communicates with an


652
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:00,896
accessory, along with the


653
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:02,006
security requirements.


654
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,896
All sessions between Apple


655
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:08,636
devices and accessories over


656
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:11,286
HomeKit are end-to-end encrypted


657
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:12,876
and mutually authenticated.


658
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:16,876
The specification provides


659
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,176
implementation details for both


660
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:21,946
IP and Bluetooth LE accessories.


661
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:25,716
And you can also get details on


662
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:27,506
how to describe each of the


663
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:29,496
accessory categories that are


664
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:31,506
supported in HomeKit, such as a


665
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,876
light bulb, fan, thermostat, and


666
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:34,576
many, many more.


667
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,066
For complete overview of the


668
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:40,126
HomeKit accessory protocol, you


669
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,186
can refer to the 2014 session,


670
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,776
Designing Accessories for iOS


671
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:45,766
and OS X.


672
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:55,466
Until now, the specification was


673
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,536
available to MFi licensees,


674
00:26:58,066 --> 00:27:00,426
whose accessories carried the


675
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:02,836
logo "works with Apple HomeKit"


676
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:04,236
after completing


677
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:05,096
self-certification.


678
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:11,876
Starting today, we are also


679
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:15,226
making a version of the HomeKit


680
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:16,966
Accessory Protocol Specification


681
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,396
available to anyone with a


682
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:19,976
developer license


683
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,651
[ Applause ]


684
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:27,286
.


685
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:29,326
So, if you are a student


686
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:31,276
developer, or even a hobbyist,


687
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,606
and want to learn about HomeKit


688
00:27:33,606 --> 00:27:35,486
protocol and want to create


689
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,906
accessories for your personal


690
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:37,976
use, you can now do that


691
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:44,606
[applause].


692
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:46,796
The HomeKit developer page has


693
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,806
been updated with the


694
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,416
specification, and also you will


695
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,226
find other useful information,


696
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:53,666
such as frequently asked


697
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,696
questions, and guidelines to


698
00:27:55,696 --> 00:27:57,656
building your HomeKit apps.


699
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,476
Because the specification has


700
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,396
Apple's proprietary information,


701
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:04,256
you will need to agree to a


702
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:05,826
click-through license before


703
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:06,606
downloading it.


704
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:08,566
And with all this information,


705
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:09,966
we are looking forward to seeing


706
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:12,186
what new ideas you're going to


707
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:13,776
come up with.


708
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:16,516
And let's say you come up with a


709
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:18,056
really cool prototype?


710
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:20,946
And now, you want to develop a


711
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:23,356
HomeKit accessory for commercial


712
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:23,646
sale.


713
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,636
You need to join the Apple MFi


714
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:27,266
Program.


715
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:31,146
You need to join the Apple MFi


716
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:32,646
Program and go through


717
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:35,006
self-certification before you


718
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,976
can begin your manufacturing or


719
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,086
sale of your accessories.


720
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:41,386
And this is really exciting.


721
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:44,846
And I recommend that you check


722
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,536
the developer page often for the


723
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:49,156
latest updates, as we continue


724
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:50,766
to introduce new features and


725
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:51,806
enhancements to the


726
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:52,596
Specification.


727
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,976
Talking about enhancements.


728
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:04,436
In iOS 11, we made some great


729
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:05,896
enhancements to the HomeKit


730
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:06,856
Accessory Protocol.


731
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:12,546
Now, let's see how a user with


732
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:15,356
iOS 10 sets up a HomeKit


733
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:17,346
Accessory, such as a light bulb.


734
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:20,666
These of course on the


735
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:24,506
accessory, by putting the light


736
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:26,076
bulb in the socket, chooses the


737
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:27,846
accessory from the add accessory


738
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:29,496
option in the Home, and scans


739
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:30,746
the eight digit setup code.


740
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:34,206
In three easy steps, the user is


741
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:35,366
able to set up a HomeKit


742
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:37,286
Accessory that is simple and


743
00:29:37,286 --> 00:29:37,626
great.


744
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:40,926
A couple of things to note in


745
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:41,556
this process.


746
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:44,736
The accessory must be powered on


747
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:45,966
for it to show up.


748
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:49,986
Secondly, the setup code is used


749
00:29:49,986 --> 00:29:51,326
for the initial HomeKit pairing


750
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:53,906
only, and this is to ensure that


751
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:55,666
you and only you are setting up


752
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:56,406
the accessory.


753
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:01,356
For many accessories that are


754
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:02,746
installed in hard to reach


755
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:05,536
places, such as a light bulb, or


756
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:06,846
have set up codes printed on the


757
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,166
back of the product, it makes it


758
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,926
difficult to scan the setup code


759
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,336
when it is powered on.


760
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,716
Or even choosing an accessory


761
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:16,896
when you are setting up multiple


762
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:18,256
accessories of the same model


763
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:19,386
becomes challenging.


764
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,766
In iOS 11, we are introducing


765
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:25,996
enhanced set of process to


766
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:27,506

768
00:30:28,336 --> 00:30:31,546
With the enhanced setup, users


769
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:34,296
can now scan the setup code, and


770
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:35,456
then power on the accessory.


771
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:38,286
To achieve this, we are


772
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,156
enhancing the setup payload to


773
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:42,926
include setup ID in addition to


774
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,646
the setup code.


775
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,746
iOS 11 uses the setup ID to


776
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:48,286
start the pairing process with


777
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:50,136
the accessory when the setup


778
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:53,026
code is scanned, and matches to


779
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:54,396
the accessory when it is powered


780
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:54,576
on.


781
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:55,796
It is that simple.


782
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:59,016
To deliver the enhanced setup


783
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:03,096
code, we are now supporting


784
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:05,416
scanning of QR codes for setting


785
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,366

.


788
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,996
The QR code is standards based


789
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:18,806
and can be as small as 10 by 10


790
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:19,336
millimeters.


791
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:20,976
That is pretty small.


792
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:34,866
The small form factor of the QR


793
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:36,226
code will help a lot of


794
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,616
manufacturers to put the QR code


795
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:42,126
on the smaller accessories, and


796
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:42,996
this is really great.


797
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:44,956
But we didn't stop there.


798
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:49,816
We took one step further, and in


799
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:51,386
addition to supporting QR code,


800
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:55,866
we also added support for NFC


801
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:56,296

about this.

With NFC tags that are


806
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:05,266
programmed with the Enhanced


807

808
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,026
even more seamless user


809
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,136
experience for setting up


810
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:11,656
accessories.


811
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,016
The user needs to just tap to


812
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,096
pair and it is that simple, and


813
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,666
it is fantastic.


814
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:22,046
The whole experience in setting

00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:23,726
up accessories in iOS 11 with


816
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:25,866
the support of QR code or NFC


817
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:28,576
tag for HomeKit Accessories is


818
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:29,326
just fantastic.


819
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:33,526
Now, let's talk about Bluetooth.


820
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:38,796
Over the last few years, we have


821
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:40,946
seen an influx of Bluetooth LE


822
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:42,046
HomeKit Accessories.


823
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,876
This is because Bluetooth LE


824
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,246
Accessories offer a lot of


825
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:47,076
advantages.


826
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:50,426
They are small, they are


827
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,456
extremely low power, and many


828
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:54,276
are battery operated, such as a


829
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:55,756
contact sensor, motion sensor,


830
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:57,596
and many more, and users use


831
00:32:57,596 --> 00:32:59,486
these to trigger events when a


832
00:32:59,486 --> 00:33:00,956
certain action takes place.


833
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:03,266
And this is really great.


834
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:10,176
Now, let's see how Bluetooth


835
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:12,806
notifications work in iOS 10.


836
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:16,496
In iOS 10, when an accessory


837
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,646
state changes, it triggers a


838
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:20,296
state change notification.


839
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:23,736
The home of apple TV in this


840
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:25,556
case picks up the state change,


841
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,936
and then establishes a


842
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:30,136
communication, a secure


843
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:32,336
communication with the accessory


844
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:33,886
to determine what state has


845
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,226
changed, and then triggers the


846
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:36,786
automation.


847
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:41,856
The whole process results in a


848
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,906
few seconds of latency for the


849
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:45,986
automation to be executed.


850
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:49,516
In iOS 11, we changed the


851
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:51,396
mechanism completely to


852
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,196
significantly reduce latency,


853
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:56,416
and we are doing this by what we


854
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:58,736
call Secure Broadcast Session to


855
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,706
send the notification.


856
00:34:01,276 --> 00:34:02,966
Here, the iOS controller


857
00:34:03,516 --> 00:34:04,926
configures the accessory with an


858
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,056
encryption key, and the


859
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:08,866
interested characteristics that


860
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:10,326
can be included in the secure


861
00:34:10,326 --> 00:34:11,565
broadcast notifications.


862
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:15,876
Now, when a characteristic


863
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,406
changes, the accessory encrypts


864
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,216
the state change, and then sends


865
00:34:23,216 --> 00:34:24,976
a notification to the Home app,


866
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,335
which will then immediately


867
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:28,156
execute the automation.


868
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:33,306
With this enhancement, we are


869
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,056
seeing a number of accessories


870
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:36,606
where the latency has gone from


871
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,275
a few seconds to under a second


872
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:39,326
for the events to be triggered.


873
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:41,795
And the best part about this


874
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:44,906
enhancement is that you just


875
00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:46,826
need to upgrade to iOS 11 and


876
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,596
get new form ware for your


877
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:50,496

878
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,476

Coming to accessory categories.


890
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:20,266
HomeKit supports a wide range of


891

This year, in iOS 11, we are now


897
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:39,056
adding support for sprinklers


898
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:39,746

908
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:00,506
faucets.


909
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:04,136
For many users, it is a daily


910
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:06,736
ritual to turn on the shower,


911
00:36:07,226 --> 00:36:10,036
let the water run, and wait for


912
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,976
the water to turn to the right


913
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,586

cup of coffee, you can let Siri


917
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:23,986
know it's bath time, and by the


918
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:25,026
time you finish your cup of


919
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:28,056
coffee, the water temperature is


920

To ensure accessories are


936
00:37:05,676 --> 00:37:08,056
trusted and self-certified, we


937
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:09,956
have adopted hardware-based


938

authentication.


939
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:16,526
Starting with iOS 11, we are now

00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:02,606
We now have automated tools to


961
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:04,246
test your accessory and continue


962
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:05,966
to automate more and more test


963
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,256
cases, and we urge all MFi


964
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:10,206
licensees to always get the


965
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,236
latest tools before you begin


966
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:12,776
your testing.


967
00:38:14,396 --> 00:38:16,646
Also, we are glad to announce


968
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:18,996
that we now have two Apple


969
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,726
authorized third-party labs here


970
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:22,526
in the United States, and


971
00:38:22,826 --> 00:38:24,466
authorizing more third-party


972
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:26,846
labs in China, and UK next


973
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:26,976
month.

[ Applause ]


975
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:32,876
>> And this should help a lot of


976
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:34,766
MFi licensees to launch the


977
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,066
accessories sooner.


978
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:42,046
To recap the session, this year,


979
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,326
we introduced many compelling


980
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:46,366
and useful HomeKit features.


981
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:48,716
Matt talked about the great


982
00:38:48,716 --> 00:38:50,136
enhancements to event triggers,


983
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,436
and introduced new APS you can


984
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:54,616
adopt in your apps to redefine


985
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:55,446
home automation.


986
00:38:56,936 --> 00:38:58,386
I shared news about HomeKit


987
00:38:58,386 --> 00:38:59,176
Accessory Protocol


988
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:00,706
Specifications being made


989
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,226
available to all developers.


990
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:05,776
And enhanced accessory setup


991
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,486
process makes it even better


992
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,966
than what it was before.


993
00:39:09,836 --> 00:39:11,406
An interruption of secure


994
00:39:11,406 --> 00:39:12,816
broadcast notifications for


995
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,126
Bluetooth LE accessories will


996
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:15,706
make the event triggers go


997
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:16,166
faster.


998
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:18,876
And introduced new accessory

00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:20,166

Faucets.


1001
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,886
And finally, we provided an


1002
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:25,826
update on automation tools for


1003
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,386
self-certification and


1004
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:28,716
authorizing third party labs


1005
00:39:28,756 --> 00:39:30,466
around the world to accelerate


1006
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:31,386
the launch of HomeKit


1007
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:31,906
Accessories.


1008
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,176
We at Apple are really excited


1009
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:43,966
about all these features, and we


1010
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,266

1011
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,966
going to do with them.


1012
00:39:48,296 --> 00:39:49,946
A couple of important things


1013
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:51,186
before we close the session.


1014
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:56,166
We have two HomeKit labs for you


1015
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,756

1016
00:39:58,756 --> 00:40:00,136

engineers, who will be happy to


1018
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:03,496
answer any questions that you

00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:04,636
have with regards to your apps


1020
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:05,646
and/or accessories.


1021

We will also be demonstrating


1022

1023
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:10,906
