00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:16,500
[ Cheers ]


2
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:30,746
>> Whether looking for the


3
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:32,445
latest TV show to watch or the


4
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:33,996
best place to grab lunch, you


5
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:35,296
rely on the people around you


6
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:36,426
for recommendations.


7
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,556
By offering the ability to share


8
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:40,136
on Your App, you can empower


9
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,696
your users to give contextual


10
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:42,586
recommendations.


11
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:44,456
But there are some important


12
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:45,846
things to consider before you


13
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,106
offer the ability to share.


14
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:50,286
First is the content.


15
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:52,206
In Your App, what will you want


16
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:53,096
your user to share?


17
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:55,166
Is it an image or a video, or


18
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,646
maybe even an experience that


19
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:57,466
they've had in Your App?


20
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:00,146
Next is placement.


21
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:01,896
Where in Your App is the best


22
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,336
place to offer the ability to


23
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:03,646
share?


24
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:05,306
If you share from a certain


25
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:06,776
screen, is it contextual?


26
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:08,536
Will the user know exactly what


27
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,096
will be passed to the recipient?


28
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,026
Timing is another important


29
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,456
aspect to building a great


30
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:15,416
sharing experience.


31
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,496
It needs to be, when a user is


32
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:18,576
completely connected to the


33
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:19,646
content they are wanting to


34
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,126
share; and at that moment,


35
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:22,686
think, "My friend Kate would


36
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:23,216
love this."


37
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:25,886
The developers of Crossy Road


38
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,776
have a great implementation that


39
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:28,916
has narrowed all three of these


40
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:29,366
areas.


41
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,446
They started with an experience.


42
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:33,636
Now, it's quite common to share


43
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,206
your progress in a game, but


44
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:36,376
losing in Crossy Road is


45
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:37,826
actually quite comical.


46
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:39,136
They quickly realized that


47
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:39,976
people are going to want to


48
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,366
share that moment and created a


49
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,486
photograph representation and


50
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:44,816
previewed it, ready for sharing.


51
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:46,746
The timing, content and


52
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:47,936
placement were all great.


53
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:49,776
Think about the user of Your


54
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,986
App.


55
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,556
When are they most emotionally


56
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:52,646
attached to the experience and


57
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,266
going to want to share it?


58
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,576
Another important aspect of


59
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:57,876
sharing is placement.


60
00:01:58,486 --> 00:01:59,466
It doesn't make sense for a


61
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:00,866
sharing button in a list view


62
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:03,136
here; but on a detail view, it


63
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,606
does.


64
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:05,106
As I find a session I'm


65
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,666
interested in, I might think of


66
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,676
someone else that could be


67
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:09,256
interested and can very quickly


68
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:09,656
share it.


69
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:13,036
The way you offer the ability to


70
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:14,306
share in Your App is with an


71
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:15,006
action button.


72
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:16,996
This is the universal control


73
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,546
used by all apps to access


74
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:18,956
sharing.


75
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:20,946
A great place for an action


76
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,496
button in a detail view like


77
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:24,086
this is in the title bar.


78
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:25,906
It helps communicate to the user


79
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,026
that you can share all the


80
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,306
information in this view.


81
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:31,346
On tapping that button, you can


82
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:33,296
call a UIActivityViewController.


83
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,026
This will display the user's


84
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:36,006
sharing options.


85
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,066
By default, the system has some


86
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,626
built-in sharing options, like


87
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,986
messages, mail and notes; but


88
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,426
other options will populate here


89
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,036
from apps that have implemented


90
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:46,056
a share extension.


91
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:47,526
When creating the


92
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:49,386
UIActivityViewController, you


93
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,586
can parse in pretty much any


94
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:53,056
object, like a string, image or


95
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,546
URL.


96
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:55,566
But the best way to share the


97
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,006
content of Your App is to use


98
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:57,906
the universal link.


99
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,796
A universal link looks like a


100
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:01,946
URL, but instead launches Your


101
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:02,136
App.


102
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:05,776
At this stage, you might be


103
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,666
asking, "Why share a URL?


104
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:08,996
This is not a Web page."


105
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,366
Well, you have to consider the


106
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,526
person receiving the shared


107
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,196
information.


108
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:13,486
They may not have Your App


109
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,756
installed; so when tapping a


110
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,296
universal link when Your App is


111
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,656
not installed, it will fall back


112
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:20,866
to Safari, making it possible


113
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,186
for people with Your App to


114
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,656
share content with new people


115
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:24,936
that do not need Your App to


116
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:25,606
view the content.


117
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:28,906
Then if a new user receives a


118
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:30,156
link to the content in Your App,


119
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:31,896
an app banner can be displayed


120
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:33,306
in Safari, and it's a great way


121
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,566
to increase awareness of


122
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,086
innovative experience to draw


123
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:37,316
new users of Your App.


124
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:40,296
Another way you can increase the


125
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:41,406
sharing experience for the


126
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,136
recipient is to use Mockup in


127
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:43,766
Open Graph.


128
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,346
Then the content shared in


129
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,916
iMessage can be displayed in a


130
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,666
rich format; so instead of


131
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,716
looking like this, it can look


132
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,536
like this -- with an image


133
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:53,466
preview and title.


134
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,666
The recipient of this message is


135
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,976
much more likely to tap and


136
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:57,726
follow this link.


137
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:00,536
So in summary, think about the


138
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:02,176
content and experiences in Your


139
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,366
App.


140
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:04,246
What will your user like to


141
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,866
share; and when is the most


142
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:07,886
meaningful time to share?


143
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:09,446
Do they know enough about the


144
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:10,676
content to want to share it?


145
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,276
Use the action button to launch


146
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:14,266
sharing and consider the


147
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,346
placement of that button for


148
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:15,946
context.


149
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,076
Universal links will work with


150
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:19,386
recipients that don't have Your


151
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:21,036
App, and app banners can guide


152
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:22,906
them to Your App.


153
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,846
Finally, mock up your Web page


154
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,766
with Open Graph for rich sharing


155
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,556
in iMessage.


156
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,246
For more information, see the


157
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,736
resources section of this video.


158
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,276
Thank you, and feel free to


159
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:33,646
share it!
