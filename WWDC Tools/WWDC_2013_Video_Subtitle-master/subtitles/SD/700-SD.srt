00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,146
>> Welcome to Designing
Accessories for iOS and OS X.


3
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:17,666
So, my name is Peter Langenfeld.


4
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:20,676
I'll be walking you guys
through the session today,


5
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,836
and a little bit about what
are we going to talk about.


6
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:24,906
Of course, we're going to
talk about the new features


7
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:27,336
in iOS 7 and in Mavericks.


8
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,726
We want to spend a
little bit of time talking


9
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,006
about the frameworks
that you guys can use


10
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,046
as application developers
to utilize accessories


11
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:38,366
and to better expand
the accessory ecosystem.


12
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,086
And then, of course, we
want to focus in on some


13
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,796
of the technologies and new
things we've done overall


14
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:44,696
and the exciting--


15
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:46,306
these exciting parts that
we think you guys have


16
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:50,726
opportunities in regarding
Wi-Fi, AirPlay, Bluetooth,


17
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:52,076
Lightning connector,
few other things


18
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:53,876
that we'll probably
touch on in between.


19
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:57,146
So, first, I want
to thank you guys,


20
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,806
thank you for coming today,
thank you giving me a nice crowd


21
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:02,296
to get nervous in front of.


22
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:03,706
But also thank you
for developing


23
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:05,976
such great devices
and accessories.


24
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:08,416
It really makes us excited
everyday to come in to work


25
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,626
and to work on the overall
accessory ecosystem,


26
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:13,076
see how many cool
things appearing


27
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:15,326
for our users to enjoy.


28
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:20,876
You know, one of the big
things that we notice working


29
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,806
on accessories in the
accessory ecosystem is


30
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:27,996
that you guys have really
helped our devices become a part


31
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:30,446
of people's everyday lives,
a critical part of that.


32
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,466
And so I want to give
you guys a few examples


33
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,716
of the things we find
really interesting and kind


34
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,936
of maybe give you some ideas


35
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,986
of areas you can work
on and expand on.


36
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,276
Of course, we always like
to see new things as well.


37
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:43,816
So health and fitness
is great area


38
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,686
that we've been seeing a
lot of expansion recently.


39
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:49,226
You know, in this
particular example,


40
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:50,726
we have a blood pressure cuff,


41
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:54,796
but we also have fitness
monitors, Wi-Fi scales,


42
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:57,206
things that basically
help people to keep track


43
00:01:57,206 --> 00:02:00,766
of their everyday lives to
become better individuals


44
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:04,466
and to really make the
merging of the applications,


45
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:09,246
the iOS device, the Mac device,
and the accessory system meshed


46
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,326
into their everyday lives
and improve life in general.


47
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:12,396
And we think that's great.


48
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:13,756
We love seeing it.


49
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:16,506
Of course, we also have
some home products as well.


50
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:21,056
Here's the Nest thermostat
and it really, again,


51
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,856
just highlights the fact
that you can merge this


52
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:27,186
into your life, you can
utilize it, you can decide


53
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:29,996
to save some energy, you can
decide to heat up your home,


54
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,616
you can decide to see
how you're doing as far


55
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:37,236
as performance overall so that
you can add something more


56
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,066
to your overall experience
than just "Oh,


57
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,246
I feel cold," or "I feel hot."


58
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:41,976
You can actually see
how things are going


59
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:42,876
and we think that's great.


60
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,546
And then finally, fun.


61
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,816
Everybody likes to have fun.


62
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:48,006
We like to have fun.


63
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:51,236
And we think it's fun that you
guys have enabled things like--


64
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:53,936
they are drawn to play
kind of the interactive,


65
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:57,226
virtual reality video
games essentially.


66
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:00,476
And all of that is
enabled by accessories.


67
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,016
All of that is enabled
by you guys.


68
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:04,726
And it makes us excited
and thrilled to come


69
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,666
to work every day,
create solutions together


70
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,626
that we can really get
the overall consumer base


71
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,236
excited about.


72
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:12,836
So how do we do that?


73
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,336
Well, here's the
infamous super slide.


74
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:19,266
These are all the different
technologies that we support.


75
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:20,436
There's obviously many more


76
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,726
but we think these ones
are particularly important.


77
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,656
And this here, I
think, we really want


78
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:30,946
to highlight the fact that OS
X and OS 7-- iOS 7, excuse me,


79
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:33,976
work together and
as app developers


80
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:37,446
and accessory manufacturers, you
guys can support both platforms,


81
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:42,666
mostly seamlessly and really
support more consumers overall.


82
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:47,016
So we have a few actual
connectivity options listed


83
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:47,576
on the slide.


84
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:51,806
Of course, Wi-Fi, Lightning,
Bluetooth low energy are things


85
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,506
that we're very excited about


86
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,656
and are pushing forward
constantly as far


87
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:57,626
as the technology bases.


88
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,776
But also things such as
the 3.5-millimeter jack,


89
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:03,706
the headphone jack are
also opportunities for you


90
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:07,036
as developers to take
advantage of in both your apps


91
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,806
and in the overall
accessory ecosystem.


92
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,046
So we want to highlight
those things.


93
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:16,255
Of course, there are also the
way you access these things


94
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:20,106
from apps, the actual protocols
and the frameworks, like I said,


95
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:24,076
that are available, again,
across both OS platforms.


96
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:25,936
And so let's dive in
to a couple of these.


97
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,836
Let's talk a little bit about
what you can do with them


98
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,716
and we won't be able to
hit them all but hopefully,


99
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,716
we can give you some
ideas of places


100
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,366
where you could start developing


101
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,956
and getting some
exciting products going.


102
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,876
First up, USB Audio.


103
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:43,086
You access USB Audio
as an app developer


104
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,346
through the Core Audio
Framework that's both


105
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:49,276
on iOS and OS X again.


106
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:52,476
And, you know, you
can design products


107
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,406
that are USB 1 compliant
and we will support them.


108
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:59,816
We'd really recommend you guys
start thinking about USB 2.0


109
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,906
as a standard and that's on the
accessory manufacturing side.


110
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,266
And that's for both
input and output devices.


111
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:10,236
You know, although you
can support a number


112
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:14,356
of sampling rights on both the
physical device side and the OS,


113
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,326
the application side, we want
to stress that, you know,


114
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:20,616
16-bit when you're
PCM, 32, 4401,


115
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,466
48 kilohertz is really the
standard that we focus in on.


116
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,316
And so we do make
it a requirement


117
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:28,956
of all external accessories to
support those sampling rights


118
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,816
and we would suggest as
application manufacturers,


119
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,776
application developers,
you also focus


120
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,126
in on supporting those rights
and make sure not to block them


121
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,196
from requirement standpoint.


122
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,046
You do have access
to multichannel audio


123
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:43,346
on both sides should
you choose to use it.


124
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,386
And then finally, of course,
volume synchronization.


125
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:50,536
If you adjust the volume on the
OS side or you adjust the volume


126
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,646
on the accessory side, the
two should be synchronized.


127
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:55,246
You should get volume
increases and decreases


128
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:57,586
as the consumer really sees fit


129
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,046
and that's all available
to you as well.


130
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:02,376
So next up, something new.


131
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,716
We talked about this
a little bit yesterday


132
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,236
and we'll be talking about
it more throughout the week,


133
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,556
is game controller.


134
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:09,276
This, we think, is great.


135
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,766
This is something we're
really excited about.


136
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:15,186
We've decided to standardize
around the concept that iOS


137
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:19,396
and Mavericks should have a
consistent game controller


138
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,126
experience that you
can use in both places,


139
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,356
and that application
developers can utilize


140
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:25,966
to create richer,
more immersive games.


141
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:29,666
As you can see, we have a
standard game controller


142
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:31,966
and of course, we
also expand that out


143
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,436
to an extended game controller.


144
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,056
Really, the extended game
controller adds a secondary


145
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:40,556
trigger button or shoulder
button and some joysticks.


146
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:44,876
And we do have a session
later today actually


147
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,606
to talk a little bit more
detail about the hardware


148
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:49,536
and the software
requirements of that.


149
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,726
Also, reference it a little
bit later in this presentation.


150
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:54,496
But please, if you're
interested in game controller,


151
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,886
come to the labs, go to the
sessions, and really get


152
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,846
to know more about this 'cause
this is something we think is


153
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:02,946
really to make the game space
a great, a better experience


154
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:06,376
than it even is today,
and that's hard to create.


155
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,156
Okay. So iPod accessory
protocol.


156
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,706
We now refer to this
as iAP usually,


157
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:13,736
and you'll hear us
all slip in to that,


158
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:16,546
so that's what we're referring
to if we talk about it.


159
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:20,776
And the key here is it's
basically how you access a bunch


160
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:23,056
of the system services on iOS.


161
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:28,156
It's been around since we
introduced the 30-pin dock many


162
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,726
years ago, we've kept it around.


163
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,176
We continued to expand it.


164
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:33,596
We continued to think it's
a great way to interface


165
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:36,906
with accessories in
an Apple-specific way.


166
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,596
We've given you access
to the media library,


167
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,756
and what that means is you
can look at all the metadata


168
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:46,316
on the device, organize as
we organize it, and you can--


169
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,476
on your accessory side, you
can decide to display it


170
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:52,016
to your user in a way that
you think makes the most sense


171
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:54,346
to them and allow them to browse


172
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,026
and use playback
controls, et cetera.


173
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,686
Next up, of course,
is the accessory--


174
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:02,426
external accessory protocol,
EA as we like to call it.


175
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:04,726
It's the best way to have
an application talk directly


176
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:08,506
with your physical accessory
that you decide to design.


177
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,066
And the exciting
part there, I think,


178
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:13,476
is that we also have app
discovery and app launch.


179
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,186
So, if someone goes out
to the store and decides


180
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:19,126
to buy an accessory for the
first time, they plug it


181
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:21,156
in to their device or they
connect it to their device.


182
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,046
The first thing that
the device does


183
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,366
from a system aspect is
ask you, "Do you want


184
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,726
to download the app
for this device?"


185
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:28,096
It's a great feature.


186
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,226
It prevents people from
having to search on the store.


187
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:31,646
It prevents people
from having to look


188
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:32,956
through the manual, et cetera.


189
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:35,275
And we think people
really enjoy it


190
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:38,836
and we love the way it's working
out and we hope you guys decide


191
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:40,645
to try and exercise
that a little bit too.


192
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,456
The next, location information.


193
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,076
You can decide to expand
the location capabilities


194
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:46,566
of your device.


195
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,046
Finally, accessibility.


196
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:51,706
Obviously, some people, some
of our customers need some help


197
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:55,326
in using our devices and we've
made these frameworks available


198
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,486
to you to make sure you
can design accessories


199
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,306
that help them use that
and help everyone enjoy


200
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,626
and utilize their iOS
device to its fullest.


201
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:09,546
Many of the technologies
I've been talking about fall


202
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:11,036
under the MFi Licensing Program.


203
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,986
MFi is made for iPod,
iPhone and iPod.


204
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:16,496
And what does it include?


205
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:22,226
Well, it's a program that gives
you access to our connectors,


206
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,436
to receive a Lightning
connector.


207
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:28,786
[ Pause ]


208
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:32,026
Our headphone with remote
system which is a great way


209
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:36,406
to not only listen to the music
and audio from your devices,


210
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:40,366
both on the MAC side
and on the iOS side,


211
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:43,506
but also allows you
to use the controls.


212
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:46,366
Again, volume controls,
play/pause, all of the things


213
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,686
that people are used to
using on a day-to-day basis.


214
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,976
Finally, AirPlay
licensing, we now allow you


215
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:55,756
to create AirPlay accessories
and finally, AirPrint.


216
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,856
And really, the intent
here is to make sure


217
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:01,366
that there's a sense of
quality for the consumer


218
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:01,976
when they go into a store.


219
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:05,876
We keep the MFi Program
around and we allow the badge


220
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:08,496
to be used on products
that Apple


221
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:10,446
and the accessory
manufacturers have worked hard


222
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:14,456
to guarantee our solid quality
experiences for the consumer.


223
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:16,866
So, when you go shopping
for an accessory,


224
00:10:17,186 --> 00:10:19,786
you know with confidence
that if I buy this accessory


225
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,126
and take it home, it'll
work with my device today,


226
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,286
and it'll also work with
my devices in the future.


227
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,716
If you want to join
the MFi Program,


228
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,466
we obviously have many
people you can talk


229
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:31,596
to in the lab sessions today.


230
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:34,636
We highly encourage
you to chat with us,


231
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,016
understand with it's about,
understand what you get.


232
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,996
Some of the highlights, you
get full technical information


233
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:43,006
of how to interface
with our devices.


234
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,896
You get access to all the
components, so connectors,


235
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:48,866
headphone, mic-- and
mic systems, et cetera.


236
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,616
All tools that we
make available as far


237
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:54,816
as developing accessories,
this will help you understand


238
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:58,046
if you're speaking the protocols
properly, if you're electrically


239
00:10:58,086 --> 00:10:59,986
in sync with our specifications.


240
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,426
And finally, it gives you access
to the product certification


241
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:06,306
and the logos and
compatibility icons


242
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:08,116
if you pass product
certification.


243
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:14,516
So that's what I'm going to
do from a high-level overview.


244
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,306
Obviously, it's a complex phase.


245
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:19,046
Like I said, we definitely
have many lab sessions


246
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,626
that we are more than
happy and willing to talk


247
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,546
to you guys about this.


248
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,436
And, you know, I'm just
trying to highlight here


249
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:27,176
that no matter what
transport you decide to use,


250
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:29,426
you pretty much have an
option to do some sort


251
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:31,966
of communication, whether here
it's audio or communication


252
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:35,906
with apps, there's also a
number of other options we have.


253
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:38,056
So, hopefully, you guys
are getting inspired,


254
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,286
hopefully you guys
are getting excited


255
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:41,306
to make some accessories,
to make some apps that work


256
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:45,106
with accessories, and we would
really enjoy talking to you.


257
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,806
So, please come along
and ask some questions.


258
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:53,846
Let's switch gears just a little
bit and let's talk about some


259
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,706
of the advances we have in
specific technology areas.


260
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,876
First up, I'd like to
highlight wireless.


261
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,146
We at Apple think wireless
is a great solution,


262
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,846
and wireless includes
both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,


263
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,096
and Bluetooth low
energy of course.


264
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,816
And why we like wireless so
much is that the consumer gets


265
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,886
to keep the device in their
pocket or in their hand,


266
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,956
and they don't have to worry
about walking over to it


267
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:19,416
and plugging in it or having a--


268
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,246
forgetting it somewhere
and leaving it.


269
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,456
They can just walk into the
room where these things exist


270
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,536
and they can start
using it seamlessly,


271
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:26,566
which we think is great.


272
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:30,866
On the Wi-Fi front, couple


273
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,346
of things we think you guys
should be thinking about.


274
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:37,226
On the software side, definitely
realize that networking sockets


275
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:39,046
and ports are your friends.


276
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,266
We have great frameworks
for dealing with both.


277
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,506
They're totally open.


278
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,896
You can determine how
you want to speak to


279
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,226
and communicate with
your accessory.


280
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,996
And I also highlight that we
have Bonjour, and I'll talk


281
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:52,196
in some more detail in a minute


282
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:55,786
but Bonjour is really the best
way we think for consumers


283
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:59,106
to be able to interact with
network devices without having


284
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,516
to know the technical
details of them.


285
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,376
On the hardware front, a couple
of things I want to stress,


286
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:06,036
and I've talked about this
in the past but hopefully,


287
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,666
we can all get on
board with this now.


288
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,806
The Wi-Fi Alliance Certification
is really important


289
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:11,736
in the Wi-Fi space.


290
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,686
It makes sure and ensures
that you have inoperability,


291
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:19,226
it makes sure that when your
customer brings the device,


292
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:21,286
it's not going to interfere
with other Wi-Fi devices


293
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:23,176
in their home, and it's
also going to work well


294
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:26,046
with any brand of
router and any brand


295
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,766
of infrastructures
that they may have.


296
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,466
Dual band operation I think
is also something that we


297
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,006
like to stress and
I realize it's--


298
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:35,556
it may seem unnecessary
on the accessory front.


299
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:40,546
But we all have more and more
RF interference in our homes.


300
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:43,996
And obviously, everything is
using the 2.4 gigahertz space.


301
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,246
We have Wi-Fi, we
have Bluetooth,


302
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:47,696
we have all these technologies,
ISM unlicensed band.


303
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,176
And so we really
want to encourage you


304
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:53,776
to give the consumer the option
to put both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz


305
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:57,016
into the device so they can use
whatever gives them the best


306
00:13:57,016 --> 00:14:00,196
experience, so, to
avoid audio dropouts


307
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:04,416
and communication breakdowns
and the fact that if you walk


308
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,706
to one corner of your home


309
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:08,006
and your neighbor has
a strong Wi-Fi signal,


310
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,246
you may get more
error rate, et cetera.


311
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:13,496
If you enable the products
with dual band performance,


312
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:16,306
hopefully, we can avoid that
and we can get to a better place


313
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:20,746
as far as wireless usability and
enjoinment from our consumers.


314
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,306
The final two things are
really on the software front


315
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:27,316
but they're specifically
targeted towards hardware OEMs.


316
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:30,006
And so, I want to stress
quality of service, WMM,


317
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,916
this is an inherent
part of 802.11n.


318
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,426
You have to certify for it.


319
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,216
What I really make sure
is that high bandwidth


320
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:39,186
and high priority traffic


321
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:42,046
on the network actually gets
the priority it deserves.


322
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:45,426
So, it makes sure that you
avoid network dropouts again,


323
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,566
it'll make sure you,
you know, avoid glitches


324
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,706
in your video stream, which
is in your audio stream,


325
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:50,956
those sorts of things.


326
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,286
And finally, IPv6 versus IPv4.


327
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:57,556
Now that we're entering the
age of the internet of things,


328
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,986
the fact that everything is
connected, we're quickly going


329
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,426
to start running out addresses.


330
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:05,376
And so we at Apple, believe
strongly we should all be making


331
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:08,336
the transition over to IPv6
and we encourage you guys


332
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,106
to make sure that you have
the ability to do the same.


333
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,126
A little bit more on Bonjour.


334
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:15,176
So, as I mentioned before,


335
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:19,586
Bonjour is a zero-configuration
networking protocol suite.


336
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,396
Really, what it boils down to


337
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:25,106
from the consumer's perspective
is that use a friendly name.


338
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:31,346
So, you don't have
192.168.0.1 or 10.0.0.1


339
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,326
or something identifying
your product.


340
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,436
You name it WAMP or computer
or microphone or something


341
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,496
that means what it
does to the consumer


342
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:42,746
and the consumer has the
ability to rename that device


343
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,786
and to have the experience
to find that device


344
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:47,336
on their network just by using
the name that they can remember.


345
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:48,776
We think that's great.


346
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:53,086
No worry about IP addresses,
no worry about URLs, hopefully,


347
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,276
no worry about having to go
to the user manual to find


348
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:57,466
out where to find out
where they should be going


349
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:58,336
to configure things.


350
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,966
It should just be easy for
them to bring something home,


351
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:03,046
put it on their network
and enjoy it


352
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:04,376
with the name they recognize.


353
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:09,106
Next up is network
service discovery.


354
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,856
What this does is
it allows the--


355
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:14,376
well, allows applications
to filter


356
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:18,756
down what devices the consumer
sees by the actual function


357
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:19,576
that they want to provide.


358
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:24,016
So, for example for AirPlay,
we use Bonjour to make sure


359
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,586
to only display those devices


360
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,946
that support AirPlay audio
coming to them instead


361
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,716
of showing all the
devices on your network


362
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,756
that might perhaps
support something


363
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:33,506
that you're interested in.


364
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,636
By doing this, you give to
your consumer a much targeted,


365
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,486
a much more enjoyable experience
'cause they only see the things


366
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:40,996
that they need, they
only see the things


367
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:43,486
that they can use
right now for the type


368
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,016
of things that they want to do.


369
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,176
We believe so strongly in this.


370
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:49,196
We've actually made
this open source.


371
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,426
It's part of the
mDNSResponder project.


372
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:55,086
You can find it at the
address listed there.


373
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,626
We highly encourage you
to go and take a look


374
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,276
and if you have any
more questions


375
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:02,476
about general functionality,
obviously you can talk to us


376
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:04,685
in the accessory labs or I'm
sure you can find someone


377
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:06,766
in networking labs that can
help talk you through this


378
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:10,425
and give all of our consumers
a better or raw experience.


379
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:12,656
Configuring wi-fi accessories.


380
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,306
You know, I talked about this
need to make sure we get way


381
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:20,076
from forcing people to go to the
user manual and forcing people


382
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:24,415
to come home with their device,
set it up, get ready to use it,


383
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:26,925
only to realize, "Oh
wait, how do I get this


384
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,076
on my Wi-Fi infrastructure?"


385
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:31,016
But we took care of
this a couple years back


386
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:33,106
and we enabled Wi-Fi
information sharing.


387
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,956
What it does is you plug the
accessory into a physical port


388
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,926
or Bluetooth and then it
asks you, "Do you want


389
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,546
to share your networking
credentials


390
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:44,296
to your iOS device that's
already on with your accessory?"


391
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:45,576
Great, perfect.


392
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:46,096
They can say yes.


393
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:46,836
They can say no.


394
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,066
Great, it's all configured,
you don't have worry about it.


395
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:49,786
No manual needed.


396
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:55,246
However, we did hear from a
few people, wouldn't it be nice


397
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:56,626
if we didn't have to
include a physical port?


398
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,716
Wouldn't it be nice if you
can do this Wi-Fi-only?


399
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:01,656
Well, we agreed and now you can.


400
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,746
So, what I'm showing you
here is a Wi-Fi-only way


401
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,036
to configure your accessories.


402
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,926
Essentially, what happens on
the accessory front is it goes


403
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,546
into a software AP mode,
software access point mode.


404
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,556
And we identify it as
non-configured device.


405
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:17,916
So, up there on the screen,
you can see set up new device.


406
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,576
This is a very similar
system that we've had


407
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:21,976
for our AirPort products
for a while.


408
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:23,366
We've just added third parties.


409
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,706
So, you see Thermostat there.


410
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:29,136
So, if I select Thermostat,
I now get the option


411
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:32,486
to join the network to my
iOS device that's already on.


412
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,196
I can obviously show
other networks


413
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:36,836
so I can select a
different network if I like.


414
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:38,866
And then I can rename it.


415
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,866
If I click on the name--
accessory name section,


416
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,236
I can decide I want to call it
something other than Thermostat.


417
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:45,756
I want to call it, you know,
Back Bedroom Thermostat


418
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:48,246
or Garage Thermostat or
somewhere else that I want it.


419
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:52,756
Then I click Next,
voila, lo and behold,


420
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:56,426
we securely transfer all the
networking credentials including


421
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,566
the passwords and anything
else that user may not remember


422
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,006
down to the accessory.


423
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:04,826
The accessory rejoins the
target network and you're done.


424
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:06,916
We do have one more thing,


425
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,286
if that accessory
has an application,


426
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:12,826
we also allow you to-- the
consumer to click on Find


427
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:13,806
Out for this Accessory.


428
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,406
It will do a search and take
you directly to the App Store


429
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,866
and they can be off on their
way again without having


430
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,626
to open the manual,
without having


431
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,266
to think anymore about it.


432
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,156
Of course, we don't want to
leave Mavericks out of this.


433
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:30,646
So, we also have the ability
to go up to the Wi-Fi menu,


434
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:34,556
obviously you see new accessory
up there, same choices,


435
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,166
you select Thermostat,


436
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,576
or AirPort updater
program launches.


437
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:42,866
You have the ability to
select both of them there.


438
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:47,456
Again, chose your network,
rename if you so please


439
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,826
and you're also on
the network there.


440
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,776
So, whether you're
using Mavericks


441
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,126
or whether you're using iOS 7,


442
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,896
your consumer now has the
ability to get on to the network


443
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,946
in easy way only using Wi-Fi.


444
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:58,896
We think this is great.


445
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:02,596
It's going to be part of the MFi
Program and we're super excited


446
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:05,656
to have people come and talk to
us about how you implement this.


447
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:06,726
So please come and talk to us.


448
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,616
Obviously, one of the
great things this pairs


449
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,456
with is AirPlay Audio
and we've talked


450
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:12,986
about AirPlay Audio a
little bit in the past.


451
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:14,596
It's a third-party program.


452
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,416
It is part of MFi that allows
you to configure the device


453
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,486
and have it be part of
our AirPlay ecosystem


454
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,696
so you can stream audio
to the third-party device.


455
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:27,956
We have audio/video receivers,
speaker docks, television.


456
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:31,466
We have all sorts of things
in this expansive ecosystem


457
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,656
that allows you to listen


458
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:34,686
to your music how you
see it fit as a consumer.


459
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,396
But we've had one
little snuck in the past.


460
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:39,206
It's been a little
restrictive perhaps.


461
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,126
So I'm happy to announce


462
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:44,066
that we're also transferring
this into a more program.


463
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,066
We're going to look at
essentially enabling all of you


464
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:52,546
to develop and create
AirPlay accessories


465
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:53,876
on whatever platform,


466
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,656
on whatever hardware
platform you see fit.


467
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:59,336
It's the same program,
same product definitions,


468
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:03,486
same feature set, same terms
of compliance, same everything.


469
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:04,596
It's just that now you get


470
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,056
to choose whatever
hardware you would


471
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,206
like to enable your AirPlay
accessories and hopefully,


472
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:11,466
that will give you guys a
little bit more flexibility


473
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:13,876
and we'll expand that
ecosystem even further.


474
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,796
With that, thank you.


475
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,866
I'd like to bring in my
colleague, Brian Tucker,


476
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,426
to talk a little bit more
about Bluetooth and some


477
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,416
of the exciting things
we have there.


478
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:23,876
Thanks guys.


479
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:24,406
[Applause]


480
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:24,906
>> All right.


481
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:25,976
Thank you, Peter.


482
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:30,096
My name is Brian Tucker and
I am ultimately responsible


483
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:33,436
for Bluetooth at Apple
and that includes iOS


484
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:37,186
and now OS X Mavericks.


485
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:42,946
And I have an incredible honor,
the guys gave me the opportunity


486
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:46,016
to come up and talk about
what's next for Bluetooth,


487
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:48,816
what are we doing with
Bluetooth now, what's the state


488
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:50,096
of the union of Bluetooth?


489
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:53,166
I'm obviously very, very
passionate about this.


490
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,606
I've actually had the
opportunity to meet a lot of you


491
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,616
in the audience here today.


492
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,356
We do have a followup
session to this


493
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:04,076
that specifically covers Core
Bluetooth in a lot more detail.


494
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:08,046
And so what I'm going to do in
this session is give you kind


495
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:11,946
of a sneak peak at some of the
things that we've done specially


496
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:15,716
in iOS 7 to really take Core
Bluetooth to the next level.


497
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,996
So where's Bluetooth today?


498
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:21,636
Well, Bluetooth is
over a decade old.


499
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,856
In fact, it's about 12
or 13 years old now.


500
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,856
Core Bluetooth or Bluetooth
low energy just came


501
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:30,676
in the market a couple of
years ago, three years ago.


502
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,786
This marks our third iteration


503
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,136
of Bluetooth low
energy implementations


504
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:38,926
in Apple products,
but what's going on?


505
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,816
This last year was crazy.


506
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:43,476
[laughs] It was nuts.


507
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:47,796
I mean, one of things that
blew me away is in the SIG,


508
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:52,116
we saw 451 percent
increase in listed devices


509
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,286
for Bluetooth speakers.


510
00:22:53,286 --> 00:22:54,836
I mean that's just nuts.


511
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:56,886
If you look at the
chart, it kind of grows,


512
00:22:56,886 --> 00:22:59,216
and then last year, it's
just this hockey puck.


513
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,406
And this year is no different.


514
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:04,046
We're seeing more and
more devices get listed


515
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,716
in the classic Bluetooth space.


516
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:10,336
So classic Bluetooth, it
is definitely here to stay.


517
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,906
It is still growing
by leaps and bounds.


518
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:14,616
We want to continue to improve


519
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,546
that user experience
with customers.


520
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,166
You know, we want to do this


521
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,716
like make AC perform
even better,


522
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:24,826
perform better coax algorithms,
to improve audio quality


523
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,356
for conversational audio.


524
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:29,336
All those areas around
Core Bluetooth that are key


525
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:32,066
to the customer experience,
we want to make better.


526
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:35,186
And what we're doing with you
guys is we're updating our


527
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:38,426
Bluetooth Guidelines document
to make better suggestions


528
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:41,986
about how to implement
hands-free and HTTP devices,


529
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:46,776
as well as make improvements
on [inaudible] in OS X and iOS.


530
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:47,596
It's pretty cool.


531
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,396
So Bluetooth low
energy, obviously,


532
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,926
I just spoke of,
it's pretty new.


533
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,086
It's only been around
four, three years.


534
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:59,536
But what's amazing is in a few
market reports that I've read


535
00:23:59,536 --> 00:24:01,636
and have been provided
to the Bluetooth SIG,


536
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:05,806
we're going to surpass a billion
Bluetooth low energy devices


537
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:06,326
this year.


538
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,046
That's ridiculous.


539
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:12,096
A Bluetooth-- a billion
Bluetooth low energy devices


540
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,766
with a technology that
realistically has only been


541
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:16,076
around for a couple of years.


542
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:17,736
That's insane.


543
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,086
So clearly, this
is a huge market


544
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,416
for you guys to step into.


545
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:25,666
And then finally, and I think
this is pretty important,


546
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:29,856
is that now every major mobile
OS manufacturer supports


547
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,136
Bluetooth low energy.


548
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:34,256
So I like to personally
welcome them to the pool,


549
00:24:34,396 --> 00:24:37,536
the water is great,
but this is awesome


550
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:40,456
because this now gives you
the ability to truly look


551
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:43,156
at a technology across
the entire spectrum


552
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:44,176
of mobile devices.


553
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:48,356
So no longer is it just our
play, we're going to continue


554
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,876
to drive this market forward.


555
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:52,576
We're going to continue
to innovate in this space,


556
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,056
but I think it's
important to note


557
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,726
that everybody feels the same
way about Bluetooth low energy


558
00:24:57,936 --> 00:25:00,046
that we do, which I think
is really, really cool.


559
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:04,266
So last year, I spent
some time with you guys


560
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:06,106
to talk about some use cases.


561
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:09,076
And these are the use cases
that I showed last year,


562
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:13,316
things like health care, sports
and fitness, toys, I don't know


563
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:15,956
if you guys got a
chance to catch the demo


564
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:17,446
in the keynote yesterday,


565
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:20,526
the Anki Drive demo,
really, really cool.


566
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:22,396
That is all Bluetooth
low energy.


567
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:26,066
That's an iPhone talking
to each one of those cars


568
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,986
with a Bluetooth low energy
link and maintaining that


569
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,226
and I would argue, one of the
worst wireless spaces known


570
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:36,066
to man and Bluetooth low
energy still operated,


571
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,356
which is remarkable.


572
00:25:37,806 --> 00:25:43,436
I was happy.


573
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:47,866
[laughs] So, with these use
cases-- there are many more,


574
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:51,616
but with these use cases, we
took a look at each one of these


575
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,846
at the beginning of
kind of our cycle


576
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:57,286
with iOS 7 and with Mavericks.


577
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,256
And we wanted to kind of put
our money where our mouth is.


578
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:04,206
We wanted to say, "If these
are so important to you guys,


579
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:06,526
if we're saying that
these are super important,


580
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,406
then what can we do to
make these even better?"


581
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:12,706
So, I wanted to highlight a
few of these particular areas.


582
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:13,866
I'm not going to
through all of these.


583
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:14,856
I don't have enough time.


584
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:18,376
But I want to highlight a
few things that we've done


585
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,006
to make some of these user
experiences even better.


586
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:22,986
And the first one I want to
talk about is health care.


587
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:27,776
And like Peter said, health care
is growing by leaps and downs.


588
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:29,726
If you look at what
we're doing with LE,


589
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:33,846
we're allowing the consumer
to quantify themselves.


590
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:36,896
I'm not sure I like this
concept called quantify itself,


591
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,116
but the-- or the name.


592
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:39,176
I love the concept.


593
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:40,586
And the idea is that you


594
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:44,066
as a consumer can now
take active control


595
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:45,096
over your own health care.


596
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:47,296
You can monitor your
own blood glucose.


597
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:48,736
You can monitor your
own heart rate.


598
00:26:49,096 --> 00:26:52,746
I saw a product that monitors
your blood glucose level


599
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:56,656
and actually gives you real-time
body chemistry information


600
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,906
as you eat your food.


601
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:01,626
So, like you can go eat a bagel
and your phone will tell you,


602
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:04,356
"Dude, your blood sugar level
is spiking, you may not want


603
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,656
to have any carbs for lunch,"
you know, kind of thing.


604
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:11,226
And that's awesome, 'cause now
I can immediately know how the


605
00:27:11,226 --> 00:27:12,926
system is operating, right?


606
00:27:12,996 --> 00:27:15,646
And as an engineer, that's
huge, [inaudible], right?


607
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:20,576
And if I have data on my body,
I can make the right choices


608
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:24,796
in real-time as I go out
throughout my day, huge,


609
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:27,846
huge opportunity
here in this market.


610
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,446
Another area is providing
a better relationship


611
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:33,286
between the patient
and the care provider,


612
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,486
the nurse practitioner
or your doctor.


613
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:39,996
And connecting the device
that's on your body with the iOS


614
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:42,796
or the OS X device
and connecting


615
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:44,316
that to your doctor directly.


616
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:48,546
So now, the doctor can take
an active role in your life


617
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:51,016
without you having to be in
the hospital the whole time.


618
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,936
And for my parents, especially,
it even gives me the ability


619
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:57,776
to monitor their
health remotely.


620
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,846
They live in Arizona, I live
in California, it's just peace


621
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,036
of mind, but they
can still continue


622
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,826
to live their lives
the way they want to.


623
00:28:05,826 --> 00:28:08,226
I think that's just huge.


624
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,116
It changes the world, right?


625
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,356
Another area where
we're kind of--


626
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,686
we put our money where
our mouth is this idea


627
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:17,946
of MFi hearing aids, or
Apple designed hearing aid


628
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,086
audio transport.


629
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:24,026
Now, about a year and a
half ago, we were looking


630
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:25,986
at this space and
we're like, you know,


631
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:29,806
Bluetooth is being used but
the experience is just less


632
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:30,536
than ideal.


633
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:32,526
You had to wear something
around your neck,


634
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,366
or you had to wear a
thing on your belt,


635
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:38,776
and it was like Bluetooth
that and magnetic inductance


636
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:42,646
to your hearing aid, or
you put it up to your ear


637
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,176
and it just sounded
really crappy.


638
00:28:44,176 --> 00:28:46,166
And we're like, "We
can make this better."


639
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,526
And so, we first started looking
at Bluetooth and like, "No,


640
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:51,926
that's not going to
work, too much power,


641
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:55,326
the chips are too
expensive, they're too big."


642
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:58,126
And then we started
looking at low energy,


643
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,206
and I remember having
conversations


644
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:03,066
with some chip guys and they
literally laughed at us,


645
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,716
you know, they didn't think
that that is even possible.


646
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:08,886
But we hammered it
and we hammered it,


647
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:12,006
and we came up with
a way to push audio


648
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:15,346
down to lower energy link,
and this is Apple iP.


649
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:18,386
And we're enabling the
hearing aid market.


650
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:21,556
In fact this year, we'll
start seeing hearing aids


651
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:25,496
on the market using this
technology, and it's crazy tool.


652
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:28,806
I mean, we'll start to see this
technology in cochlear implants,


653
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,916
where you technically have
an audio linked directly


654
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,566
from your phone into your brain.


655
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,826
I mean, it's just
nutty technology.


656
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,446
And it's also a data pipe.


657
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:41,466
So, not only that we're
pushing audio to your ears


658
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:45,046
but the doctor-- you can call
up the doctor, talk to them


659
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:48,456
on the phone and they can adjust
your hearing aids over the phone


660
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:53,136
as you're talking to them,
just awesome, awesome stuff.


661
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:55,196
So this is what I
mean about kind


662
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,596
of putting our money
where our mouth is.


663
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:59,116
And then finally--
and this is one


664
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:01,396
of those sneak peeks
I'm giving you based


665
00:30:01,396 --> 00:30:05,056
on our Core Bluetooth session,
but this idea of improved--


666
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:06,966
we improved Core
Bluetooth backgrounding.


667
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:12,206
So now with app preservation and
restoration, we give the ability


668
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,976
to launch apps in the
background and interact


669
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:17,576
with Bluetooth low
energy devices regardless


670
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:18,976
of the state of your
application.


671
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:24,376
So this gives a whole new
market of interaction especially


672
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:28,116
in areas of long-term care and
some of the areas I want to talk


673
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:28,966
about here in a minute.


674
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:32,906
So sports and fitness
is the next area.


675
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:35,846
Now sports and fitness seems
to be completely designed


676
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:36,936
for Bluetooth low energy.


677
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:40,596
Some of the products that
we've seen in the market


678
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:45,766
and the space, the Fitbit Flex,
a Bluetooth low energy product.


679
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:46,816
This is really cool.


680
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,466
It monitors your activity,


681
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:50,616
but it also monitors
your sleep cycles.


682
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,516
So it tells you how
well you slept,


683
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:55,516
as well as how sedentary
your life is.


684
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:58,016
As an engineer, I struggle
with this constantly.


685
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:02,816
But it says, "Get off your
butt and go exercise."


686
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:03,676
It's a great product.


687
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:08,516
This is one that I'm especially
excited about with my kids.


688
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:11,526
This is soccer ball made by
Adidas, the Adidas Smart Ball.


689
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:14,846
What's cool about this is it
has Bluetooth low energy radio


690
00:31:14,846 --> 00:31:17,546
in the middle and then
sensors that spider


691
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:19,366
out to the outside of the ball.


692
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:21,676
It looks like a spider
exploded inside the ball, right?


693
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:23,556
And it is connected to the ball


694
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:25,396
and it actually monitors
the activity


695
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:28,036
of the soccer ball during use.


696
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:31,066
So it monitors how well
you're passing a ball.


697
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,066
How much spin you're
putting on the ball.


698
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:36,686
In fact, it a has feature
where you take a shot on goal


699
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,226
and if you're looking
particular curve to the shot,


700
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:42,876
it will monitor that curve
and then compare your shot


701
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:46,056
against a pro shot and it will
actually tell how well you're


702
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:47,526
doing against maybe Beckham.


703
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:50,766
And you want this, that cool,
you know, right to left curve


704
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:53,696
into the top-right or
top-left corner of the goal.


705
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,436
This ball will let you do that.


706
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:59,966
So for coaches, this is huge
because it gives you the data.


707
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:03,166
In addition to that in
basketball, there is a product


708
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,976
by 94Fifty, a smart ball that
does very similar things,


709
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,796
but in a basketball space.


710
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:12,276
You take a shot, it tells
you the rotation of the ball,


711
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:15,666
it tells you the shot angle
of the ball to the goal,


712
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,036
how well you're dribbling.


713
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,616
I mean, it's awesome.


714
00:32:18,616 --> 00:32:21,146
And that somebody like
that's a data junky,


715
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:24,096
this is just a really, really
great way to get feedback


716
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,506
on how well you're doing,


717
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:29,346
as well as how well
your athletes are doing


718
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:30,116
if you're a coach.


719
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:31,476
Really, really cool.


720
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:36,686
And so, again, we feel like with
iOS 7 in the app preservation,


721
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:40,086
you can now do long-term
accessory interaction.


722
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,876
Now there is a lot to
be talked about in here


723
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:45,116
and a lot more detail in
the Core Bluetooth session.


724
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:48,616
Reno [phonetic] and Jason go in
this in great detail and talk


725
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:51,416
about how your apps
can really interact


726
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,826
with these devices
long-term always.


727
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:57,176
As long as the phone is with the
consumer, the phone can interact


728
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,216
with these accessories.


729
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,896
So the third thing is security


730
00:33:01,386 --> 00:33:05,326
and security is kind
of snuck up on us.


731
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:07,056
Security has just exploded.


732
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,686
In fact, just recently, we're
starting to see just a ton


733
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:16,956
of products in the space that
are providing you experiences


734
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:20,146
around home similar to
the experiences you get


735
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:23,646
around your car with a
wireless remote or wireless key.


736
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:28,516
Kwikset Kevo is a similar
product, you walk up,


737
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:30,166
your phone interacts
with the door,


738
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:33,426
you touch the door
lock and it unlocks.


739
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:37,686
This is a Kickstarter,
guys, Lockitron where--


740
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:39,676
a product where it just
goes over the door lock


741
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:43,106
and it can open and
unlock the door lock.


742
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:45,876
And then just recently,
just a couple of weeks ago,


743
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,586
a company called August
makes up Smart Lock


744
00:33:48,836 --> 00:33:51,646
that does very similar
things, beautiful product.


745
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,806
One of the things in their video
I thought was really cool is


746
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:58,556
this idea of being able to
share your key virtually.


747
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:01,136
So if I want to allow
my plumber, for example,


748
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:04,056
to get in my home,
let's say this Thursday


749
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:06,746
which I know I'm not going
to be there from 12 to 2,


750
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:10,755
I can send him my key and say,
"You can get into my home only


751
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,835
from 12 to 2" and
oh, by the way,


752
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:15,406
when he does enter the
home, his phone tells me


753
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,235
that he entered the
home and left the home.


754
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:20,005
It's pretty really,
really, really cool stuff.


755
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:22,295
And, again, we think
state preservation


756
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:26,036
and restoration is key here
because if the app goes away


757
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:28,235
or dies, you don't
have the ability


758
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,065
to unlock your door, right?


759
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:31,835
It doesn't interact
with the door


760
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:34,025
because the app is
no longer there.


761
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,686
And iOS doesn't a have perceived
knowledge of what it means


762
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:38,826
to interact with the door lock.


763
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:42,866
So this is really, really,
really key to this product space


764
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:46,446
and we think that this is going
to just explode this market.


765
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:54,235
Entertainment, so briefly Peter
covered this, but I just wanted


766
00:34:54,235 --> 00:34:56,466
to cover a couple of
areas where entertainment


767
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,636
and low energy is converging.


768
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:01,166
Game controller is
obviously an area


769
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,746
where Bluetooth low energy
is perfect for this space.


770
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:09,476
The small data packet
sizes, the data intervals,


771
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,836
the connection intervals


772
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:13,126
that you can achieve
just perfectly aligned


773
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:14,196
with game controllers.


774
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:18,106
Obviously, keyboards, I'm not
sure keyboards are entertaining,


775
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:21,706
but you can connect to
keyboards maybe to play games


776
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:24,216
that are a little
bit more complicated,


777
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:26,196
and then of course,
remote controls.


778
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:29,986
Like this remote control
potentially can be LE


779
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:34,166
and probably should be LE given
that this could connect directly


780
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:38,466
to an iO-- or an Apple product.


781
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,706
So, what have we
done in this space?


782
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,206
Well, now on iOS 7, we
natively support HID


783
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,086
over BLE accessories.


784
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,686
So now, if you make
a BLE keyboard,


785
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:55,986
you can connect directly to
iOS and to OS X Mavericks.


786
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:59,816
And what's important to
note here especially, well,


787
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:03,156
in both platforms is
this is the first time


788
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:07,276
that we have supported
profiles in the LE space.


789
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:12,486
That means that device
management is now being managed


790
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:16,716
by the OS, but that doesn't
take away device management


791
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,926
from your apps.


792
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,626
So if your apps still want to
discover devices and connect


793
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:23,316
to them and interact with
them, they can totally do that.


794
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:24,346
That's totally fine.


795
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:29,356
But the case of hosted
profiles such as HID over GATT,


796
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:34,156
we now managed those
devices for you.


797
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:37,786
So we felt like it's a more
of a system level functionally


798
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:39,886
and we thought it
was important for us


799
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,566
to put this into the product.


800
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,086
And then finally, proximity,


801
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:47,356
and this has been talked
about a little bit.


802
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,556
I've had countless
questions, people like,


803
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,026
"What's this iBeacons thing?"


804
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,576
You know, all those
kind of stuff.


805
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:55,726
So, I wanted to briefly
talk about this.


806
00:36:55,726 --> 00:36:58,796
Some of the areas
where proximity is key,


807
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:00,786
we already talked
about security,


808
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:05,796
advertising the ability
to go into a retail space,


809
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:08,666
and my phone starts to
interact with that retail space


810
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,046
in an advertising way.


811
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,096
I think Minority Report, but
hopefully not that creepy.


812
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:18,676
Location services,
obviously, if I'm up--


813
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:20,586
going up to a statue
[phonetic] and I want


814
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:23,136
that statue do tell me something
about the points of interest,


815
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:24,446
that's really interesting.


816
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:26,766
So what have we done
in this space?


817
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:32,926
Well, now, natively, we give
you the ability to do this iOS


818
00:37:32,926 --> 00:37:35,516
to iOS built right
within core location.


819
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,446
And this is using
Bluetooth low energy.


820
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:40,126
We don't make it obvious that
it's using Bluetooth low energy.


821
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:44,056
But then you have the ability
to engage from consumer


822
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:46,406
to consumer, iOS
device to iOS device,


823
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:47,966
these proximity services.


824
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:54,716
So that's just a few areas that
we've been working on in iOS 7.


825
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,766
So as a review, these are some
of the new things that we talked


826
00:37:58,766 --> 00:38:01,746
about here, Core Bluetooth
App Preservation Restoration.


827
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:04,766
I know it's an interesting
name, but it's really cool.


828
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:05,836
Learn about it.


829
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:06,936
It will change your life.


830
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:10,896
BLE based proximity services,
we talked about this already.


831
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:15,676
iOS hosted BLE profiles,
HID over BLE.


832
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:16,896
That should be HID over GATT.


833
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:17,806
It was the official name.


834
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:20,016
And then finally,
hearing aid support


835
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:24,096
which we think is
hugely profound


836
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:27,676
and truly does make a difference
in the world which is one


837
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,856
of our mission statements
in wireless software


838
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:31,836
and we think this fulfills that.


839
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,646
Real quick, this is kind
of our state of the union.


840
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:38,456
This is the classic Bluetooth
protocols and profiles


841
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:41,806
that we support in OS X.


842
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:44,346
You can write this
down real quick, no.


843
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:47,516
These are all available
and visible to you


844
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:50,276
in the current release
of Mavericks.


845
00:38:50,606 --> 00:38:54,436
And then on the LE side, we
have a couple of new roles


846
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:58,566
on the LE side and that is
low energy peripheral role.


847
00:38:58,676 --> 00:39:01,516
Apparently, we thought enough
about it to add it twice.


848
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:05,676
And-- but anyway, we did
give you the ability now


849
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,956
to offer up services in OS X.


850
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:12,876
And now on the iOS side,
from a Core Bluetooth--


851
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:15,836
or from a classic Bluetooth
perspective, excuse me,


852
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:18,486
these are the profiles that
we're currently supporting.


853
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,936
Nothing new here, just
a lot of bug fixes


854
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:24,046
and interrupt ability
changes to make our products,


855
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:26,896
our devices work better
with your products.


856
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:30,286
We also continue to support
the iPod accessory protocol


857
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:34,916
over Bluetooth and that's still
very much an active technology.


858
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:37,456
I use it every day
when I go to sleep.


859
00:39:37,826 --> 00:39:41,306
And then on the LE side, we have
a couple of new things there.


860
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:44,906
As I said before, Alert
Navigation Service.


861
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:46,326
We have this new thing,


862
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:49,916
brand new called Apple
Notification Center Service.


863
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:52,496
There is also going to
be documentation posted


864
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:55,576
to the developer site very,
very soon, hopefully today.


865
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:57,916
So check it out in
there and a lot


866
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,416
of this information
will be on that.


867
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:02,016
And then finally, the
current time service is also


868
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:02,906
always available.


869
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:06,466
So if you have an accessory
and you want that accessory


870
00:40:06,466 --> 00:40:08,466
to use an accurate
schedule or timer,


871
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,946
the timer in the phone is
always available to you.


872
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:14,956
So hopefully, that was a very
brief informative overview


873
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:18,186
of where Bluetooth is right
now within our OS products.


874
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:21,616
So with that, I'd like to
invite up Edwin Foo to run us


875
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:23,706
through Wired and to
continue our presentation.


876
00:40:23,776 --> 00:40:24,086
Thank you.


877
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:27,076
>> All right everybody,
so you're still with us.


878
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:31,096
Thanks for holding up this
far throughout the talk.


879
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,756
I'm Edwin and I am going to
spend a few minutes talking


880
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:38,146
with you about some of the Wired
interfaces that are available


881
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:41,296
to accessory developers
for both iOS devices


882
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,126
and Macs running OS X.


883
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:47,446
Let's start with Thunderbolt.


884
00:40:49,176 --> 00:40:50,236
This has been around
for a while--


885
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:51,736
a little while now
and it has worked


886
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:54,556
out really well for
us on the Macs.


887
00:40:54,796 --> 00:40:57,836
Thunderbolt is a high-speed
transport that's capable


888
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:01,156
of transferring both data and
[inaudible] digital video,


889
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:06,136
namely DisplayPort, at really
high speeds and it can handle--


890
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:07,856
it can handle, actually
be daisy chained


891
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:12,196
up to six devices per
port and carry power.


892
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:14,666
It's a bit of mouthful, but
in short what this means is


893
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:19,816
that you can have high transfer
speeds, one cable from the Mac


894
00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:23,136
to your Thunderbolt accessory
so there's no messed up cables.


895
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,456
And, of course, once your
users have multiple Thunderbolt


896
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:28,736
peripherals hooked
up to their Mac,


897
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:32,696
you still don't have a messed
up cables going from the Mac


898
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:34,126
to every single Thunderbolt
peripheral.


899
00:41:36,516 --> 00:41:39,006
For applications that require
really, really high speed,


900
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:42,476
mass storage really
comes to mind as well


901
00:41:42,476 --> 00:41:43,506
as digital video of course.


902
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:46,986
Thunderbolt is a great choice
and we strongly consider


903
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:52,426
that you consider using it
in accessories like that.


904
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:55,136
So how do you get started?


905
00:41:55,136 --> 00:41:58,456
Well, first, there is
a certification program


906
00:41:58,456 --> 00:41:58,996
for Thunderbolt.


907
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,056
And the reason


908
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:02,826
that certification
program is there is


909
00:42:02,826 --> 00:42:06,126
that it helps ensure a really
high quality of offerings


910
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:08,256
to users and customers
out there.


911
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:11,596
They want to be able to buy
Thunderbolt peripherals,


912
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:13,136
plug them in, and
just have them work.


913
00:42:13,676 --> 00:42:17,016
And that works in both
directions because it means


914
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:19,086
that as users and customers
get more comfortable


915
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:22,696
with Thunderbolt and depend on
it more and more, they'll begin


916
00:42:22,696 --> 00:42:23,526
to think less and less


917
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:26,856
about buying your Thunderbolt
peripherals and wondering


918
00:42:26,856 --> 00:42:27,676
if they'll work with Macs.


919
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:30,446
For those of you
who are interested


920
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:32,416
in buying device drivers
for Thunderbolt accessories,


921
00:42:33,346 --> 00:42:35,966
refer to the Thunderbolt
Device Driver Programming Guide


922
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,466
on the Apple Developer website.


923
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:42,426
Next, I'd like to
talk about USB 3.0.


924
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:46,546
Most Macs today ship
with USB 3.0 ports.


925
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:50,376
And like Thunderbolt, USB
ports can also, of course,


926
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:54,706
provide power up to
900 milliamps of it


927
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:58,176
to your USB accessories
for power and charging.


928
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:02,756
USB throughput is
still quite fast,


929
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,326
although not quite
as fast Thunderbolt.


930
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:08,006
And for those of
you who are thinking


931
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:10,166
of making USB mass
storage accessories,


932
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:12,226
we definitely recommend
that instead


933
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:14,236
of using the USB
Mass Storage Class,


934
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:19,106
please consider using the
USB Attached SCSI Class.


935
00:43:20,346 --> 00:43:24,976
The performance is much
better and all Macs--


936
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:28,316
most Macs especially Macs
that will be shipping


937
00:43:28,316 --> 00:43:30,226
with OS X Mavericks
will support this.


938
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:33,646
And last but not least,
we definitely recommend


939
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,376
that you have your
USB peripherals


940
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:38,636
and accessories certified
by the USB Integrators Form.


941
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:43,166
This will guarantee that your
accessories have maximum chance


942
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,706
of working out of the box
without have additional--


943
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,416
install additional
drivers with Macs


944
00:43:47,456 --> 00:43:49,576
and OS X releases down the road.


945
00:43:50,446 --> 00:43:54,606
Next, I'd like to give
brief overview of Lightning.


946
00:43:54,776 --> 00:43:57,036
I don't want to spend
a whole time at it


947
00:43:57,036 --> 00:44:02,656
because we did talk a lot about
Lightning last fall, of course.


948
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:05,076
But to briefly summarize,


949
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:08,016
the Lightning connector
is all digital interface.


950
00:44:08,616 --> 00:44:12,246
It is completely reversible
so that your users don't need


951
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:14,916
to worry about which way they're
plugging in your accessory.


952
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,726
And one interesting
thing about Lightning


953
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:21,376
that may not be very
obvious to most people,


954
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:23,376
but is actually felt every
single day when you plug


955
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:24,196
in your phone to charge it,


956
00:44:24,526 --> 00:44:27,456
is that Lightning connectors
have a very positive insertion


957
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,176
and removal feel.


958
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:33,356
There was no mistaking when
your user has connected their


959
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:37,176
accessory to a phone, and
likewise, there is no mistaking


960
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,396
when the user is disconnected.


961
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,846
It sounds like a purely
mechanical [inaudible]


962
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,486
but it actually is--
contributes greatly


963
00:44:44,486 --> 00:44:46,916
to the overall user experience.


964
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,866
Because if you have, I'm
sure that some of you


965
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,406
in the audience have
had experiences with--


966
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:53,756
dealing with connectors
that feel a little bit loose


967
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:54,796
or slipped out and the like,


968
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:58,286
and that can also sometimes
result in a poor experience.


969
00:44:58,986 --> 00:45:00,066
You won't have that
with Lightning.


970
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:02,866
Lightning connectors
just stop by the end


971
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,856
and they start working.


972
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,946
Another important
feature of Lighting


973
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:10,216
which maybe is not
necessarily immediately apparent


974
00:45:10,216 --> 00:45:12,356
to most people is that it
actually provides power


975
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,306
on both directions.


976
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:18,186
Lightning based accessories do
not just have to provide power


977
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:22,876
to the Apple devices although
of course we love getting power


978
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:24,156
so please send us all you can.


979
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:28,466
But it is also possible to draw
a power from Apple devices.


980
00:45:28,836 --> 00:45:31,856
Now, we do put some limitations
on that and some requirements


981
00:45:31,856 --> 00:45:34,116
because we don't want users


982
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:37,316
to be wondering why they have
this vampire essentially sucking


983
00:45:37,316 --> 00:45:38,186
power out of their phone.


984
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:44,466
But for the right categories
of accessories, getting power


985
00:45:44,466 --> 00:45:46,456
from an Apple device is
a very powerful feature.


986
00:45:46,456 --> 00:45:48,846
It means that your accessory
doesn't have to have a battery.


987
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:52,266
It doesn't have to even have
a power supply at the box


988
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:55,126
or even a connector for
external power supply.


989
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:57,736
All you see on the accessory
is the Lightning connector.


990
00:45:58,486 --> 00:45:59,716
The Lightning connector
also has--


991
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,876
is multifaceted in terms
of its data transmission.


992
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,916
That supports multiple types


993
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:08,336
of connectivity technologies
starting with USB host,


994
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:10,786
USB device, and Serial.


995
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:15,496
Now, the availability of various
accessory interface features


996
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:19,406
over these transports does
vary based on the transport.


997
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:22,876
So, we definitely do recommend
that your accessories make use


998
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:26,206
of the USB host mode
on Apple devices.


999
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,956
And by this, I mean
just be clear


1000
00:46:27,956 --> 00:46:31,646
that the Apple device is
playing the role of the USB host


1001
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:34,546
and your accessory
is a USB device.


1002
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,426
As you can see here
from the slide,


1003
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:38,596
there are more features
available today


1004
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:40,406
to USB host mode accessories


1005
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:41,936
than to USB device
mode accessories,


1006
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:44,866
and that is definitely
a trend that we expect


1007
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:46,216
to see continuing forward.


1008
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,476
We have a left out
Serial though.


1009
00:46:50,146 --> 00:46:54,636
Why? Well, Serial interfaces
are really, really simple


1010
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:58,296
to implement and they're very,
very low cost and they're very,


1011
00:46:58,296 --> 00:47:01,566
very low power, kind
of going back to why--


1012
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:03,566
the question about drawing
power from Apple devices.


1013
00:47:03,706 --> 00:47:07,096
It's something you
should definitely consider


1014
00:47:07,096 --> 00:47:10,176
if your accessory design falls
into that kind of category.


1015
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:12,956
If your data transmission
rate is not too high


1016
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:19,946
and you're drawing power from
an Apple device, you may want


1017
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:21,196
to consider that interface.


1018
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,846
I also want to talk briefly


1019
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:27,426
about the headphone
with remote and mic.


1020
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:31,866
One, the most obvious example of
course is the EarPods that comes


1021
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:32,916
in a box of every iPhone.


1022
00:47:35,026 --> 00:47:36,906
Accessory headphones that
implement the headphone remote


1023
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:38,396
and mic feature all have


1024
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:40,286
to use a standardized
microphone and transmitter chip.


1025
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:42,606
And what this means
is that they all work


1026
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,986
with all iOS devices
and most Macs.


1027
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:48,226
Applications running
on iOS devices


1028
00:47:48,226 --> 00:47:50,516
and on Macs can receive events
from the remote control.


1029
00:47:50,816 --> 00:47:52,616
So it isn't just limited
to changing the volume


1030
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:54,436
and starting playback
or pausing playback.


1031
00:47:54,946 --> 00:47:59,676
And last but not
least, I want to bring


1032
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,086
up the game controller
feature one more time


1033
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:05,466
and I'm mentioning
specifically in the context


1034
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,776
of Wired accessory interfaces


1035
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:08,106
because we're actually
very excited


1036
00:48:08,106 --> 00:48:13,426
to consider what possibilities
await for both game developers


1037
00:48:13,596 --> 00:48:15,456
and game controller
manufacturers


1038
00:48:15,746 --> 00:48:19,076
when you consider the
power of tactile feedback


1039
00:48:19,126 --> 00:48:22,236
from the game controller
buttons combined


1040
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:27,116
with the multi-touch screen tilt
and driver sensors in an iPhone.


1041
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:31,026
We're really looking forward


1042
00:48:31,026 --> 00:48:34,046
to see what creativity
arises from all this.


1043
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:37,976
And not only but the game
controller framework is going


1044
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:41,206
to be standardized so that if
you're making game controllers,


1045
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:42,226
you won't need to worry


1046
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:44,976
about which apps your game
controller is compatible


1047
00:48:44,976 --> 00:48:47,956
with 'cause the answer
is all of them.


1048
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:49,896
And we need to go
check the compatibility


1049
00:48:49,896 --> 00:48:51,826
with every single app out
there by trying that yourself.


1050
00:48:52,456 --> 00:48:54,956
The inverse holds true
for the game developers.


1051
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:57,976
They won't need to have a
closet full of game controllers


1052
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,636
that they keep testing
every single time.


1053
00:49:00,126 --> 00:49:01,666
For those of you in the
audience who are thinking


1054
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:02,966
about getting involved
with this,


1055
00:49:02,966 --> 00:49:04,796
with the controller
manufacturing inside of things,


1056
00:49:05,236 --> 00:49:08,646
look for update to the
MFi accessory interface


1057
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:12,626
specification coming soon.


1058
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:16,046
So, for more information
about all the technologies


1059
00:49:16,046 --> 00:49:18,346
that we talked about
today, definitely,


1060
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:20,486
feel free to contact
any of the three people,


1061
00:49:20,716 --> 00:49:23,666
named on this slide in addition


1062
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:25,906
to visiting the Apple
Developer Forums


1063
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:28,776
and contacting Apple
Developer Support.


1064
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,116
There are a bunch of related
sessions that you may want


1065
00:49:32,116 --> 00:49:33,916
to pay attention to as a result


1066
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,526
of having heard the
content mentioned here.


1067
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:40,016
And with that, that
concludes the session.


1068
00:49:40,326 --> 00:49:40,886
Thanks for attending.


1069
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:42,951
[Applause]


1070
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:52,606
