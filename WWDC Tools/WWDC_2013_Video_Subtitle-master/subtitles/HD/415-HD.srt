00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:16,076
[ Applause ]


2
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:17,476
>> Hello, everyone.


3
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:19,866
And welcome to session 415,


4
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:21,826
Maximizing Apple
Development Resources.


5
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,946
My name is Nahir Khan and
I'm an iOS Software Engineer


6
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:25,716
on Springboard.


7
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:31,056
So today, we're going to go
over all the different types,


8
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,226
development resources
the Apple provides to.


9
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,486
And we're going to
break them up into


10
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,436
about three main categories.


11
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:40,736
First one, is Self Help and
this is where we are going


12
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:43,896
to cover Documentation
and Dev Forums.


13
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:45,996
The second, once you've gone


14
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,396
through those is
working with Apple.


15
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,796
And with that we're
going into Bug Reporting


16
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:53,996
and Developer Technical
Support or DTS for short.


17
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,526
Finally, once you've got
your app all ready to go,


18
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,836
we're talking about getting
your app in the App Store


19
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:01,706
and over here we're
going to talk


20
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:05,236
about App Store and
iTunes Connect.


21
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:07,586
So that, let's start.


22
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,196
So the first main
category is Self Help.


23
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:12,926
So the really nice thing


24
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:16,176
about these resources is they
can access them 24 hours a day,


25
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:17,856
seven days a week.


26
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:22,366
And they're going to get let
you work at your own pace


27
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,126
and get all the information
that you need without having


28
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,826
to come here or somewhere
else, it's really nice.


29
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,166
So first one we're going to
go over is documentation.


30
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:35,106
So I'm sure you guys
are very familiar


31
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:37,956
with this site,
developer.apple.com.


32
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,156
So this is the first place that
you should go when you start off


33
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:43,466
and you learn a new
API, the item we came


34
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:47,026
up with say this week or
is it the new API to you


35
00:01:47,026 --> 00:01:48,066
that we've had for some time.


36
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:51,676
First thing you should almost
always do and check out our WWDC


37
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:55,416
and Tech Talk videos 'cause they
give you a nice broad overview


38
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,936
of our APIs and designs
and brand new features.


39
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:02,416
Once you've done that,
the next best thing


40
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,466
that you can do is go into--


41
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,526
and take a look at all the
documentation we have here.


42
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:12,306
We got lot of getting started
guidelines, so if you just want


43
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:15,366
to get in, try to figure out a
broad overview what's going on,


44
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,496
this is exactly where
you can go.


45
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:19,526
We also have our entire
development library here,


46
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,986
so if you want to
figure out how some API


47
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:27,486
or certain classes work, this
is also where you should go.


48
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:30,486
Lastly, you can also download
all of the sample code


49
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:34,616
and projects that we
provide for any or many


50
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:36,996
of the APIs that we have.


51
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:39,166
There are many new APIs
that came out this week,


52
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,106
and if you want to
understand how they work,


53
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:42,646
it's a great place to
download and check it


54
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:43,506
out and run it yourself.


55
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:47,416
So let's get in the
class reference.


56
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:50,256
So, I'm sure many of you
are familiar with this,


57
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,316
this is where you can
get the entire reference


58
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:54,746
for your entire API,
you can get--


59
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,626
take a look to see what
are the arguments I need


60
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,936
in your method names,
all that good stuff,


61
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:01,776
you can also see example code,


62
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:03,766
so you can see exactly
what you need to do


63
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,036
to actually use these
great new features in APIs.


64
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:10,986
And lastly, you can also
checkout some common issues


65
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:12,536
and frequently asked
questions that we have


66
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,066
or that you may have
about the APIs.


67
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:17,336
There's usually, if
you have a question,


68
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:18,886
and you not really
understand what's going on,


69
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:22,166
there's usually a very
good chance that's covered


70
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,526
in the common issues and
frequently asked questions.


71
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,666
One thing I should want to call
out our full programming guides.


72
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:32,756
These are entire books
worth of content here,


73
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:36,176
whether it starting off with
Objective-C and you want


74
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,876
to know how that works, you got
there, or say you want again


75
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:42,026
in to OpenGL, we actually have
the entire documentation on that


76
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:46,316
as well, or in this case we
have brand new text editing APIs


77
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:50,406
and iOS for iOS 7,
really great stuff here.


78
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:55,466
But I know what you're thinking,
you don't want to go onto--


79
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,476
have a Safari window open
and have that next to you.


80
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,856
If you're anything like me,
when you're coding away,


81
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:03,896
you want to be able to access
stuff nice and quickly.


82
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,686
And the cool thing is, you
can access all the stuff right


83
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,776
from Xcode and the Help menu.


84
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,386
Go there and you get
the documentation API


85
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:12,096
Reference guide.


86
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:16,026
And the nice thing is in Xcode
5, we've actually revamp this


87
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:19,426
to make it really, really
nice and easy to go through


88
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,375
and check these things out.


89
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,796
And not only that, there are
a lot of other cool things


90
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:25,996
that you can do in
Xcode as well.


91
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:31,226
For example, the
Option-click on any symbol,


92
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:34,426
you can get a nice quick
description of what's going on


93
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,796
and also access the header
files if you want to go in


94
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:38,106
and get maybe a bit
more information.


95
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:42,146
The nice thing is you can also
get a one click access directly


96
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:43,156
to the Reference guide there.


97
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,806
So you don't actually
have to like go and search


98
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:49,306
for that online, you got
it right through Xcode.


99
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:51,966
We also have a bit more
information in the sidebar


100
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,096
when you click on the symbol.


101
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:57,066
You get the same access to the
headers and the API reference,


102
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:00,876
but you also get our links
to any programming guides


103
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:04,416
that might be helpful with
that particular symbol


104
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,806
that you'll looking at.


105
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,586
Another nice thing is that
you can get one-click access


106
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:11,466
to some sample code as well,
it's really, really nice.


107
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:16,386
One thing I want to call
out though is at the bottom


108
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:21,256
of all our documentation
pages is a feedback area.


109
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,856
So over here this is where you
can go and report any typos,


110
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,636
missing information
that you see,


111
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,116
maybe if something
it's confusing or even


112
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:30,066
if something was helpful,
this is really great


113
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,796
where you can tell us how we can
make things better even for you.


114
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:35,066
So, if you go in
and you find, wow,


115
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,826
this are really nice document
I was reading and I'd really


116
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:40,116
like it some more stuff
is like that, let us know.


117
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:44,076
If you think, that was like
90 percent that way there,


118
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,266
but there is something else
that could make this even great,


119
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:49,666
let us know that or something
wasn't helpful at all,


120
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:50,806
that's where you can go.


121
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:55,416
So once you've actually
gone through documentation


122
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,976
that you're working on,
still not sure what to do,


123
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,176
the next best place you can
go is the Developer Forums.


124
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:08,056
So devforums.apple.com and
we have areas for iOS, OS X.


125
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:13,306
And we also have areas for
our tools and also deployment


126
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,786
and other types of things
that we provide as well.


127
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:21,786
So the nice thing about
the developer forums is


128
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:22,706
that you have peer support.


129
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,806
So you're actually there
working with the rest


130
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,276
of the Apple developer
community.


131
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:29,896
So when you have an issue and
you're not sure what's going on,


132
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:32,546
the nice thing about the dev
forums, it's a really nice place


133
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,986
where you can go
and get some help


134
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,316
and maybe triage your problem.


135
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,226
So, see and try to
actually drill


136
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:42,016
down to see what exactly is
going on, is it may be an issue


137
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,706
in a certain API was working, is
it maybe issue in your own code,


138
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:46,076
maybe it's an issue
with some virus stuffs,


139
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:47,806
it's where you can do that.


140
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,996
The nice thing is,
you can also search


141
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:54,986
if someone else has a question,
maybe it'll be helpful to you


142
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,866
or if they get that answered.


143
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:02,106
And also, you also have Apple
employees there as well.


144
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:07,666
So over here, if you see an
Apple avatar right there Dr.


145
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,126
Ernie, he's actually
one of our moderators


146
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:12,366
that you can see always
around helping people out.


147
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,516
And there are also
engineers on here as well.


148
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:17,066
So if you have a question,


149
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,566
engineers are visiting
these as well.


150
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:23,286
One thing I want to
call out though is


151
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,606
that the forums are
kind of public,


152
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:28,336
so if you have a question that
might be a bit confidential


153
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:29,406
for your own application,


154
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,786
everyone can see
what you post here.


155
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,216
So if you don't want
to go through that


156
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:37,166
and don't want everyone to
see what your secret stuff is,


157
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:41,866
I suggest you check out DTS,
and we'll go into that in a bit.


158
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:46,216
So let's go over an example
post, don't need to go


159
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,176
into too much, just some
things I want to call out here.


160
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,926
So over here we have
someone who's has--


161
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:54,036
is reading some of our example
code and the guy got confused


162
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:55,036
on something, what's
going on here,


163
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:56,656
it doesn't really
following some guideline.


164
00:07:57,906 --> 00:08:04,346
And actually, Rincewind is
actually an Apple engineer.


165
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,006
So if you ever see an avatar


166
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,506
with the little Apple
logo right next to it,


167
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:09,856
know that's an engineer
helping you out here.


168
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:11,766
Also we have little area there


169
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,736
where you can say a post
was actually helpful


170
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,756
or not very helpful to you.


171
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,896
And the nice thing is other
developers can see this as well.


172
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:23,706
So someone answers your question
and it really helped you out,


173
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,096
let other developers
know so that they'll know


174
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:27,396
that this is exactly
what they need to--


175
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:29,926
that's an exactly
answer that they want.


176
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,226
You'd also report a post.


177
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,635
So that doesn't necessarily
mean that something is bad here,


178
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,206
it could be as really
great question


179
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:37,326
but maybe it's in
the wrong area.


180
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:40,765
So if you click there, a
moderator can go take a look


181
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:42,366
on what's going on,
actually moving around.


182
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:47,386
Next, once you've gone
through all these things,


183
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,876
let's go in the areas
about helping with Apple.


184
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,756
So you work with
some documentation,


185
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:57,016
you got your app ready to go
and you need some help from us.


186
00:08:57,216 --> 00:09:00,676
So, one of the first main areas
about this is bug reporting


187
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:04,676
and for that I'm going
to hand off to Tanya.


188
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:09,556
[ Applause ]


189
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:10,796
>> Thank you, Nahir.


190
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:11,826
Good morning, everyone.


191
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,196
Thanks for joining us
here, I know it's Friday


192
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,856
and it's almost lunch.


193
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:18,496
So I'll try to make it
as quick as possible.


194
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,526
My Name is Tanya and I'm
an iOS Software Engineer


195
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:23,436
on the MAPS team.


196
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:26,066
And today, we're going
to talk about a topic


197
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,926
that is very near
and dear to me.


198
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:29,666
In fact, it's near
and dear to a lot


199
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,546
of Apple engineers,
bug reporting.


200
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:35,256
And we're going to talk about
how you can utilize bug reports


201
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:38,306
to communicate with Apple
regarding the issues you've been


202
00:09:38,306 --> 00:09:38,916
running into.


203
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:43,646
So let's start with the
very fundamental question


204
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,856
on why should you
file bug reports?


205
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:52,216
You should file bug reports
because it provides a way for us


206
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,106
as Apple engineers to
help you out directly.


207
00:09:55,106 --> 00:10:00,316
You see we worked really hard
to make an amazing platform,


208
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:04,146
make amazing tools that help
you make wonderful applications


209
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,456
that delight our customers.


210
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:09,636
But sometimes, there might be
issues, there might be problems


211
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:12,996
that we did not anticipate,
and when you run into these,


212
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,396
we would like you
to let us know.


213
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,256
We would like you to let us know


214
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:18,826
so that we can take
the appropriate action


215
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:20,246
to address those quickly.


216
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:24,396
When you file a bug
report it goes directly


217
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:27,576
to an Apple engineer, I
read these bug reports.


218
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:30,606
All the engineers, you might
have met during the labs


219
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,896
and sessions, they
read your bug reports,


220
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:35,316
they're surely not eaten by
the trolls in our dungeons,


221
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,186
this feedback is important,


222
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,796
these back reports
are important.


223
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:42,946
So, if you want a direct
communication channel


224
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:46,026
to an Apple engineer to
tell us some of the--


225
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:49,116
to tell about the issues
that he would be encountering


226
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:52,796
in our software, bug
reports are the way to go.


227
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,846
Sometimes, when I tell
people to file bugs,


228
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,256
they have a few questions.


229
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:02,976
Sometimes they say, well,
Tanya, I saw this problem,


230
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:05,746
but it was an extremely
trivial issue,


231
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:09,846
you see perhaps it was a typo
or the color was a little off,


232
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,596
should I still file
a bug report?


233
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,416
Yes, absolutely.


234
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:14,776
File a bug report.


235
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:18,086
You see, a problem
that might seem trivial


236
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:20,856
to you might have some
really bad consequences.


237
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:25,456
Also it might manifest
itself in worse ways.


238
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:26,946
So file a bug report.


239
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:32,696
Sometimes we say, well, you
know, this problem happened once


240
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:36,166
and it never happened again,
I never ever saw this again.


241
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:37,836
Should I still file
a bug report?


242
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,576
Yes, you should file
a bug report.


243
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:44,746
You see, even though, the
problem only happened once,


244
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:48,326
it might still have been a
really bad user experience.


245
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:52,336
Others might hit it too and
other might hit it more number


246
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,746
of times, so file a bug report.


247
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:59,196
Sometimes they say, well,
it's a really obvious problem,


248
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,936
I'm sure you have 12
copies of the bug.


249
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,796
I am sure someone else
has already filed it,


250
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,776
should I still file
a bug report?


251
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:10,036
Yes. You should still
file a bug report.


252
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:15,166
You see, it's better to
have five copies of the bug


253
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:16,756
than to have none at all,


254
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:18,696
there's a good reason
I say that.


255
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:25,296
At Apple, if an issue is not
tracked using a bug report,


256
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,686
it essentially does
not exist for us.


257
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:32,906
Bug reports are like
to-do items,


258
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,516
we track everything using bug
reports, bugs [inaudible],


259
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:42,836
even big features that go
into a particular release.


260
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:46,146
And some other things
that might not seem


261
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,096
so obvious to start off of it.


262
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:54,706
When I come into work
every morning, in fact,


263
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:58,206
when all Apple engineers
come into work every morning,


264
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:02,546
the first thing we do is to
go through our list of bugs


265
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:06,976
to figure out what is it
that we need to do that day.


266
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:10,476
To figure out, if you're on
track for a particular release,


267
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:16,016
I know that's a good
one, it's an actual bug.


268
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:18,716
To figure out, if
you're on track


269
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:22,176
for a particular release our
program office, our management,


270
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,366
they go through a list of bugs
to figure out if you're focusing


271
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,096
on the right things
at the right time.


272
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:30,256
So we track everything using
these bug reports, bugs,


273
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:33,316
features, coffee
problems, elevator problems,


274
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,866
all of that, these
are important.


275
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:41,176
So now that we know why these
bug reports are important,


276
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,966
where do you actually
go to file these?


277
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:50,396
The one stop shop for filing bug
reports is bugreport.apple.com,


278
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,206
this is the only official
way of filing bug reports.


279
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:56,326
When you file a bug report, you
are provided with a problem ID


280
00:13:56,326 --> 00:14:01,146
and you can use this ID to
track the status of your bug.


281
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:05,236
Also, even after the bug
is filed, you have a way


282
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,796
to provide additional
information.


283
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:08,286
On the other hand,


284
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,986
if the engineers have any
clarifying questions for you,


285
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:14,926
they have a means to get back
to you with these questions.


286
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:18,806
And one thing to keep
in mind when you're file


287
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:21,916
in this bug reports is
to keep things specific.


288
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:25,576
Follow the golden
rule of bug filing,


289
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:29,286
just to use one report
for one issue.


290
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:33,516
Things that might seem
related to you, and might seem


291
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:35,696
like they can be
grouped together


292
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:39,816
into one bug report might
actually very different things


293
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:43,086
and there might be different
engineers working on it.


294
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:48,376
So help us track things better
by keeping things specific,


295
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,246
so file one report
for one issue.


296
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:55,576
So what do you file
these bug reports for?


297
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:57,316
Well, when it comes to software,


298
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,636
there are few things you can
use these bug reports for.


299
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:06,776
Bugs, if you notice something
does not work as expected,


300
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:10,106
that's a software defect, that's
a bug, so file a bug report.


301
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,986
If you notice an application
quits unexpectedly or crashes


302
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:20,226
or if it's hanging and
unresponsive, file a bug report.


303
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:25,556
If you notice your
application slow or hanging


304
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:28,066
or perhaps leaking memory
and you think it's a problem


305
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,086
in our API, file a bug report.


306
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:36,246
If you have a suggestion for a
new feature or an improvement


307
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:39,056
of an existing feature,
file a bug report.


308
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,616
One thing to keep in mind


309
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,836
when you're filing
these bug reports is


310
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,076
to file them as early
as possible.


311
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,506
Do not wait till the last
seed to report an issue


312
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:53,066
that might be blocking
essential functionality


313
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,026
of your application.


314
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,996
There's a good reason why
I say that and it relates


315
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:58,266
to how we schedule things.


316
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:01,556
So let's look at the
graphical representation


317
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:02,926
of the problem at hand.


318
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:07,586
So the horizontal axis
represents the various


319
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,256
milestones in our release.


320
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:13,156
The vertical axis
represents the probability


321
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:18,546
that the bug will get addressed
in that particular release.


322
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,506
If you notice the blue line


323
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:23,466
that relates little
parameters curves downwards.


324
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:26,026
So if the green arrow
had to present


325
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:31,056
when we receive the bug
report, you can tell easily


326
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,196
that the sooner you file,
the higher the chances


327
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,986
that your bug report,
bug will get addressed


328
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:38,406
in that particular release.


329
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:41,996
On the other hand, if you
wait till the last minute,


330
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:43,346
we run out of time.


331
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:45,886
Also the fix that is needed


332
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,916
to resolve the problem
you had reported,


333
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:52,326
it might be very risky, so we
might not be able to incorporate


334
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,076
that into a particular release.


335
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,606
But does that mean,
it just expires,


336
00:16:57,606 --> 00:16:58,666
we don't look at it ever?


337
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,506
Absolutely no.


338
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,306
We will address that
in the next release.


339
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:07,156
Now there are few
other things you can do


340
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:11,006
to improve the chances of your
bug getting fixed in time.


341
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,226
But before we talk about that,


342
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:17,205
let's look at what actually
happens after you file your bug.


343
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:19,715
So as we had established
earlier,


344
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,546
it goes directly to
an Apple engineer.


345
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:27,546
The engineer might forward
it to other engineers


346
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,176
if the underlying cause
of the issue is not


347
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:31,596
in their area of expertise.


348
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:35,036
But for the sake of
simplicity, let's just assume,


349
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:36,746
it stays with that one engineer.


350
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:39,236
Now in the perfect scenario,


351
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,846
the engineer will understand the
problem, will investigate it,


352
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,936
come up with the fix, and
integrate that into a build.


353
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:51,006
Once the fix becomes
available in a release build,


354
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:53,126
we send the bug back to you.


355
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:57,506
Now we recommend that when
you get back the bug report,


356
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:00,956
you verify that the problem
was fixed and we also recommend


357
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,296
that you do this as
soon as possible.


358
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:07,556
You see sometimes, the issue
might not have actually been


359
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:11,226
fixed and you have the option
of sending the bug back to us


360
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,756
and by responding
quickly, you make sure


361
00:18:13,756 --> 00:18:17,626
that there still enough time
for us to reinvestigate it


362
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:20,266
and still fix it in
that particular release.


363
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:25,406
Sometimes, the bug
may come back to you


364
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,806
as a duplicate, what
does this mean?


365
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:31,996
This means that there is an
existing bug report that we have


366
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:35,676
that is tracking the same
issue as you had reported.


367
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,836
Now does this mean this is
just a waste of your time?


368
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:39,546
Absolutely not.


369
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:41,556
Duplicates are important.


370
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,566
You see, your bug report
might have better information,


371
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,626
it might have more
actionable data


372
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:50,126
than the original
bug that was filed.


373
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:55,236
Also many times, we use a number
of duplicates as an indicator


374
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:57,736
of how widespread the problem is


375
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,366
so that we can prioritize
it correctly.


376
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:06,466
Even if your issue was tagged as
a duplicate, you have the option


377
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:10,116
of requesting status of the
original bug, just put a comment


378
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:13,106
in your bug report and we will
provide the relevant information


379
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,046
to you.


380
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:21,756
Sometimes, when you file a bug,
we might send it back to you


381
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:23,456
as insufficient information.


382
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:25,166
What does this mean?


383
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:30,256
This means that the bug report
does not have enough information


384
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,006
for us to diagnose the problem.


385
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:35,476
Now if possible you
want to avoid running


386
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:39,246
into this scenario, and there
is a good reason why I say that.


387
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:43,106
Let's bring back our older time


388
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,266
versus [phonetic]
probability graph


389
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,536
and see what it looks like.


390
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:49,146
If you read-- you did the
right thing by filing early,


391
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,716
so you started out strong.


392
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,936
But unfortunately, the bug
report did not contain enough


393
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:56,726
information, so we
sent it back to you


394
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,036
with clarifying questions.


395
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,266
You collected the information


396
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,266
and sent it back to
us which is great.


397
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:06,626
But unfortunately in all
this valuable time was lost.


398
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,336
So even though you had
started out strong,


399
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,956
you end up on the lower
part of the curve.


400
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,686
To avoid this back and
forth formal information,


401
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:21,936
start out with a well
written actionable bug report


402
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:24,856
in the first place.


403
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,506
To make your bug report
actionable it should be clear,


404
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:33,586
concise, informative,
constructive and specific.


405
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:37,806
To ensure that your bug report
has all these qualities,


406
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:41,796
let's go to the different
components of a bug report


407
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:44,856
and talk about some of the
things you should keep in mind


408
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:46,576
when you're filing a bug report.


409
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:51,606
So here are the different
components of a bug report,


410
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:56,046
the problem report title,
the problem detail section,


411
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:57,866
additional enclosures,


412
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,116
configuration information
and reproducibility.


413
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:05,296
Let's start by looking
at the title.


414
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:11,756
Think of the title as an
advertisement for your issue.


415
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:16,176
You want it so that when the
engineer reads the title they


416
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:18,186
want to open it and
investigate it.


417
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:21,036
A good title is clear
and succinct.


418
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:24,796
Think of it like a tweet, you
see, you have limited space,


419
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,076
but yet you want it to convey
as much information as possible.


420
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,906
So make every word
count, avoid filler words.


421
00:21:33,106 --> 00:21:36,606
Drop off any articles of
preposition or pronouns


422
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,826
that are not needed there.


423
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:42,016
So a good title should
stand on its own.


424
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:47,656
You see a title is often seen
a list of tens or thousands


425
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:50,446
of bugs and could be
totally out of context,


426
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:56,276
also above title is often use
as a search for you issue.


427
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:59,196
So, when you're coming up
with the bug title think


428
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:02,166
about how is it that you
would search for the issue


429
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:04,936
and hopefully that will
give you some hints


430
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,926
on how to structure it.


431
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:10,506
So let's look at an example.


432
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:13,246
Here we have one, copy
and paste is broken.


433
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:17,486
Now, it's surely succinct
its only five words.


434
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:20,416
It's probably descriptive
though,


435
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,456
it doesn't really tell us how
is it if we perform the copy


436
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:26,196
and paste and surely we don't
know what we mean by broken.


437
00:22:26,196 --> 00:22:27,676
So let's improve this further.


438
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:32,276
Here we are at information
about how is it's that we--


439
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:33,966
that perform the copy operation.


440
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:35,036
This is fine.


441
00:22:36,076 --> 00:22:38,496
But there's still the
word broken in there,


442
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:40,726
which is not descriptive.


443
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:44,586
So we add information about
what is it that we saw.


444
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:49,116
Now this is pretty good,
but we can get bonus points


445
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:52,326
by prefixing it with
the software version


446
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:53,366
where we saw the problem.


447
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:56,496
Now this is especially
relevant for seed build,


448
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:59,876
'cause when we see the title
we can clearly and easily tell


449
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,896
that this problem
was encountered


450
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:04,236
in a seed build versus
a GM Build.


451
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:10,006
Next up, is the problem
details component.


452
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:14,276
When we talk about problem
details we mean be descriptive.


453
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:19,006
Remember, the engineer who's
reading your bug report was not


454
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,986
present with you when
the problem had happened.


455
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:23,616
They had not seen
what you had observed.


456
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:28,226
So tell them about it, and
this is the place to do that.


457
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,266
The problem details component
has five different subsections.


458
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:36,716
Let's talk about each
of them one at a time.


459
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:41,276
Start with summary, the problem
summary section is probably


460
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:45,146
recapping the title and
include some more descriptive


461
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:46,316
summary information.


462
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:48,266
What was going to?


463
00:23:48,556 --> 00:23:49,406
What happened?


464
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,826
And why is it a problem?


465
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:56,546
If you encountered an error
message, this is a great place


466
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:59,686
to put the exact text
of the error message.


467
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:04,066
And so remember be specific.


468
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:07,596
Saying Safari is slow is
generally not good enough.


469
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:11,026
Is Safari slow compared
to other browsers?


470
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:15,026
Is Safari slow compared to
Safari on other machines?


471
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:18,406
Is Safari slow compared to
Safari's earlier versions?


472
00:24:19,016 --> 00:24:19,656
Be specific.


473
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:21,956
Also use the correct
terminology?


474
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:25,696
If you're not sure what a
particular control is called,


475
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:26,966
use a screenshot.


476
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:29,706
Because that will tell
us exactly what it is.


477
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:34,146
So be precise and
avoid weird language,


478
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:38,216
saying nothing happens
does not communicate much.


479
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:41,426
Instead tell us what is
it that you did expect


480
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,786
to happen and did not happen.


481
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:48,106
So instead of saying nothing
happens when I try to print


482
00:24:48,106 --> 00:24:50,866
from Safari, try
saying this instead,


483
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,196
the printer progress
dialog does not appear


484
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,626
after I select the print button.


485
00:24:56,326 --> 00:24:56,966
That is much better.


486
00:24:56,966 --> 00:25:00,956
So let's look at
an example summary


487
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,146
for the copy and paste problem.


488
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:06,946
We start out by recapping
the title which is great,


489
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:10,576
and then we add some other
observations that we had made


490
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:12,356
when the problem had occurred.


491
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,276
This is pretty good.


492
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:17,906
Next up is steps to reproduce.


493
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:21,906
The problem with steps
to reproduce is to think


494
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:24,906
of what it would take
to reproduce the issue


495
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:27,436
on a freshly set of
device of machine.


496
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:31,536
Pretend you're telling your mom
on how to reproduce the issue.


497
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:35,896
Put yourself in the shoes
of the engineer and think


498
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:39,516
about what is it that
they might need to know


499
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:41,566
to diagnose the problem
correctly.


500
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:42,906
So anticipate the sort


501
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,626
of questions they
might have for you.


502
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:49,206
Also remember do not make
assumptions about them knowing


503
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:50,586
about your application.


504
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:52,616
So be specific.


505
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:56,536
Instead of saying open the
file, tell us how is it


506
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:57,456
that you open the file.


507
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,616
Did you open the
file using finder?


508
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:01,546
Did you open the
file using terminal?


509
00:26:01,716 --> 00:26:03,726
That might be a relevant
piece of information.


510
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,236
Always remember it's better


511
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:06,936
to include more information
than less.


512
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,306
So with that, let's
look at an example.


513
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:13,306
The same copy and paste
problem we've been working with.


514
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:17,666
So we start out fresh, we do not
make any assumptions of the code


515
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:19,056
that might have happened
before this.


516
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:23,096
We provide information
about how is it


517
00:26:23,546 --> 00:26:25,266
that we perform the
copy operation.


518
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:29,746
Next up, we move onto how is it
we perform the paste operation.


519
00:26:29,746 --> 00:26:32,806
We launch the Mail app,
select the compose button


520
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:37,846
and then select the paste button
that appears in the callout.


521
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:42,836
This is pretty good.


522
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:45,696
Next up, are the two
results sections,


523
00:26:45,756 --> 00:26:47,926
expected results
and actual results.


524
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,606
Use these sections to specify,


525
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:53,156
what is it that you'd
expected to see?


526
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,846
And how was it different
from what you actually saw?


527
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:59,586
Now this piece of information
has actually very important,


528
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:04,026
because sometimes what you
expect might not be consistent


529
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:05,936
with what the engineer expects.


530
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:10,226
So by specifying this we can
clearly tell why you thought it


531
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,086
was a problem what had happened.


532
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:16,116
Let's look at an example.


533
00:27:16,756 --> 00:27:21,686
Start out by specifying, what is
it that we did expect to happen?


534
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:24,116
Which was us being
able to paste image.


535
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:28,076
Then we specify what is
it that actually happened,


536
00:27:28,236 --> 00:27:30,366
which was us ending
with an image,


537
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:32,626
containing a blue box
containing question mark.


538
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:36,426
Now it might not be clear
what is it that we mean


539
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:39,806
by this blue box
containing a question mark.


540
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,356
So in all these cases attaching
a screenshot is a great idea,


541
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:48,666
it will tell us exactly
what you saw.


542
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:54,246
With that let's talk about
the regression section.


543
00:27:54,766 --> 00:28:00,536
Use a section to specify
when does the problem occur,


544
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:02,556
when does is it not occur?


545
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:06,316
So did the problem happen
in the first seed of iOS 7,


546
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:09,846
but did not happen
in iOS 6 and earlier.


547
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:14,486
Also does the problem go away
if the application is relaunched


548
00:28:14,746 --> 00:28:16,136
or if the machine is rebooted?


549
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:20,246
All that is relevant information
for the regression section.


550
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:22,816
Let's look at an example.


551
00:28:23,596 --> 00:28:25,506
We start out by specifying,


552
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,856
when is it that we
did see that problem?


553
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:30,636
Which is the iOS 6 seed.


554
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:34,556
Then move on to specifying
the software configuration


555
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:36,566
where we did not
see the problem,


556
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:38,706
which is iOS 5 and earlier.


557
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:43,846
We also provide some other base
we had not seen the problem


558
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:45,896
which was using an
alternative way


559
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:48,006
of performing the
copy operation.


560
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:53,536
Let's talk about
the next component


561
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,146
which is the additional
enclosures.


562
00:28:55,146 --> 00:29:00,526
Now when you're filing a bug
report there might be extra


563
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:03,986
information that you
can attach to your bug


564
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:09,046
that will greatly help us
understand the problem a


565
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:09,496
lot quicker.


566
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:15,716
Now an example of that
is a sample project.


567
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:18,106
You see, when I find a
sample project attached


568
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,936
to a bug report it pretty
much feels like finding gold,


569
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:22,076
because these are awesome.


570
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:24,296
They are great for two reasons.


571
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:29,266
First, it helps you isolate
the problem to figure


572
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:33,166
out if it's an issue with
your code or with our API.


573
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:38,766
Second, it helps us understand
the problem a lot quicker,


574
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:42,546
because we have a focus
example to work with.


575
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:44,656
So sample projects are great.


576
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:51,236
In addition, there might be some
other logs that you can attach


577
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,976
that will greatly help us
diagnose the problem quicker.


578
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:59,436
Our online webpage has some
excellent documentation


579
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:01,926
on what sorts of
logs you can attach


580
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:03,326
to what sorts of problems.


581
00:30:03,356 --> 00:30:05,286
And it also has detailed steps


582
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:07,966
on how you can go
about retrieving it.


583
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:09,836
Let's go through of few of them


584
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:12,706
that are common in
a lot of cases.


585
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:15,286
First up are crash logs.


586
00:30:16,256 --> 00:30:19,446
So if you run into
a crash you may want


587
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:20,986
to attach the crash log.


588
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:25,246
To retrieve the crush log
for an iOS device start


589
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,616
by connecting the device
to your host machine.


590
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:29,956
And then sync it with iTunes.


591
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,546
This will transfer the log file


592
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:35,696
from your device to
your host machine.


593
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:40,366
So the next step is
to locate the log file


594
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:41,666
on your host machine.


595
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:45,666
Now, if you're using a MAC,
look under this location


596
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:49,586
which is the User Directory,
Library, Logs, CrashReporter,


597
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:53,876
MobileDevice, and then a folder
name corresponding to the device


598
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:55,146
where the issue had occurred.


599
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:59,106
You'll see files of this
format, there will be prefix


600
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:02,486
for the name of the application
of the process that had crashed.


601
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:04,876
And will also contain
a timestamp


602
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:07,226
from when the issue
had occurred.


603
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:09,836
So hopefully this will provide
you with enough information


604
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:13,586
on figuring out which is
the file you need to attach.


605
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:18,596
If you had connected your
device to a Windows machine,


606
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:21,306
it's the same steps, but
you just need to look


607
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,636
under a different location.


608
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:30,646
If you'd encountered the
crash on in OS X machine,


609
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:36,116
look under this location which
is the User directory, Library,


610
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:40,686
Logs, DiagnosticReports,
you should see the files


611
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:41,866
for the same sort of format.


612
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,586
They'll be prefix for the
crashing application process


613
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:47,836
name and will contain
the timestamp


614
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:51,836
from when the problem
had occurred.


615
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:54,016
Next up are console logs.


616
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:57,726
Now these logs are great
because they capture some really


617
00:31:57,726 --> 00:32:00,946
important application and
system state information.


618
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:03,966
They might contain
some error information


619
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:06,646
that will help us understand
the problem quickly.


620
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,166
So to capture these
for iOS devices,


621
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:15,186
launch your Xcode organizer
window, select the console tab


622
00:32:15,186 --> 00:32:16,526
from the left inside panel.


623
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:18,576
Reproduce the issue if you can,


624
00:32:19,316 --> 00:32:23,216
and then save it using the Save
log as button at the bottom.


625
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:27,596
On OS X it's a bit different,


626
00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:31,346
we use a different application
called console, it's located


627
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:34,286
under the Utilities folder of
your Applications Directory.


628
00:32:35,116 --> 00:32:39,896
So once you launch it, you get
a window that looks like this.


629
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:43,146
Select the All Messages tab
from the left inside panel,


630
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:46,386
reproduce the issue if you can.


631
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:49,596
And then save it
using the Save a Copy


632
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:51,266
As option from the File menu.


633
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:59,196
Screenshots, now a picture
is worth a thousand words.


634
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:03,816
And this is especially relevant
when it comes to bug reports.


635
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:07,366
You see, you might have
run into a display issue


636
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:09,956
or a screen rendering
issue that is very hard


637
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:11,136
to describe using words.


638
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,076
Or as we had mentioned earlier,
you might have use the control


639
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,976
and you don't know
what it is called.


640
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,386
So use a screenshot in
all these scenarios.


641
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:21,716
To capture a screenshot
on an iOS device,


642
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:25,816
press and release the Power
and Home button together.


643
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:28,356
And that should save
the screenshot


644
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:29,976
as a photo in your photos app.


645
00:33:30,116 --> 00:33:33,636
So you can go about retrieving
it using the usual ways


646
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,906
of either emailing it or
syncing it with iTunes.


647
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:40,396
There's an alternate
way you can use which is


648
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:41,976
to use the Xcode Organizer.


649
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:46,116
So select the screenshots tab
from the left inside panel


650
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:49,466
and then use the new
screenshot button at the bottom.


651
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:54,886
If you want to capture
a screenshot on OS X,


652
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:57,296
there are few different
commands depending


653
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:58,796
on what is it that
you want to do.


654
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:02,666
To capture the full screen,
use Command+Shift and 3.


655
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:07,106
To capture a part of the
screen use Command+Shift and 4,


656
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:10,176
and just specific window,
this is actually handy,


657
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:12,746
Command+Shift+4, and
then press the spacebar.


658
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:16,686
All these shortcuts save
an image on your desktop


659
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,766
that you can very easily
attach to your bug report.


660
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:25,106
You know sometimes
screenshots are not good enough.


661
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:28,676
Perhaps you're trying to
describe a sequence of events


662
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,656
or a bad animation or
something being slow.


663
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:35,255
In all these cases screen
recordings are great.


664
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:40,706
To capture a screen recording on
OS X, launch QuickTime Player,


665
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:44,596
select the New Screen Recording
option from the File menu,


666
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:48,226
select the start recording
button, reproduce the issue,


667
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:52,146
stop the recording you should
have a movie file you can very


668
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:53,485
easily attach to
your bug report.


669
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:54,556
This will be great.


670
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,746
Next up are snapshots.


671
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:02,996
You know, snapshots are
essentially a state snapshot


672
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:05,656
of all the processes
that we're running


673
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,906
at the time the snapshot
was captured.


674
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:12,696
So if you run into a performance
issue on an iOS device.


675
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:14,626
If something is slow


676
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:17,236
or something is just
stacked doing some task,


677
00:35:18,256 --> 00:35:19,176
capture a snapshot.


678
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:22,536
In fact capture multiple
snapshots because since each


679
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:26,036
of these is a snapshot, we
might need multiple to figure


680
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,456
out what is exactly
causing the slowness.


681
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:33,816
So to capture a snapshot
on an iOS device,


682
00:35:34,906 --> 00:35:37,626
press and release one
of the volume buttons


683
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,186
and the home button together.


684
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,406
This should create a
log file on your device


685
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:46,706
and use the same ways of
retrieval as a crash log.


686
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:49,656
So connect to your device,
to your host machine,


687
00:35:49,656 --> 00:35:53,516
sync it with iTunes and
look under the same location


688
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:55,426
as you would for a crash log.


689
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,836
The log file will be
prefixed with the word stacks


690
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:01,316
and will contain the timestamp


691
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:03,296
from when the problem
had happened.


692
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:07,836
If you run into performance
issues


693
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,816
on OS X capture sample logs.


694
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:13,416
So if you notice
something is slow


695
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:17,116
or something is just stack doing
something, capture sample logs.


696
00:36:17,486 --> 00:36:21,496
So launch your terminal window
and run sample with the name


697
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:24,756
of the application or process
that is behaving poorly.


698
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:26,886
Now that should all put a file


699
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:29,596
that you can very easily
attach to your bug report.


700
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:33,676
Another great tool
that is available


701
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,026
on OS X is sysdiagnose.


702
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:39,066
So, if you run into a
system performance issue


703
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:41,766
on OS X this will capture a lot


704
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,646
of very useful state
information.


705
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:46,656
So launch your terminal
window, type in sysdiagnose,


706
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:48,586
take a few minutes to run.


707
00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:53,086
But by the end of it, you'll
have a collection of rich logs


708
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,216
that you can attach
to your bug report.


709
00:36:55,686 --> 00:37:01,896
I have to admit, this is a lot
of work and it's probably going


710
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:02,746
to take a lot of time.


711
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:07,056
But even though collecting
this information,


712
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,376
sort of making the
sample project


713
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:13,846
or attaching these logs they
might be optional in some ways,


714
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:17,666
you might still want to spend
the time collecting this.


715
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:22,406
And let me convince you by
bringing back the good old time


716
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,696
versus probability graph.


717
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:27,666
You see when you attached
this additional information,


718
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:29,806
[inaudible] sort of moves up.


719
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:34,286
The chance is that
the bug will get fixed


720
00:37:34,346 --> 00:37:35,546
for that particular release.


721
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:38,376
It goes up because
it's much easier for us


722
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:40,806
to understand the
seriousness of the issue.


723
00:37:41,196 --> 00:37:43,756
Understand the issue
itself as well.


724
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:47,866
So the next time you're filing
a bug report, think about it,


725
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:51,776
whether to spend that extra
time collecting this information


726
00:37:52,726 --> 00:37:54,276
in order to improve the chances.


727
00:37:54,766 --> 00:38:00,586
With that, let's talk about
the configuration information


728
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:02,106
component of a bug report.


729
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:06,186
Use this section to
specify the software


730
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:09,486
and the hardware configuration
of the device or the machine


731
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:10,886
where you saw this problem.


732
00:38:12,176 --> 00:38:15,846
So in iOS, this would be the
hardware model and version,


733
00:38:16,686 --> 00:38:18,506
the exact software version.


734
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:22,096
Now, remember, sync iOS 6
is generally not good enough


735
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,236
because we shift
many different builds


736
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:26,206
of iOS 6 in the last year.


737
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:29,256
So, to find out the
exact version,


738
00:38:29,646 --> 00:38:33,266
launch the settings app,
navigate to General-About


739
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:35,286
and look under the
version field.


740
00:38:35,286 --> 00:38:38,846
You should find the exact string
corresponding to the build.


741
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:43,446
Also if there was any
other hardware involved


742
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:46,856
in this problem that you
saw specify information


743
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:47,636
about that as well.


744
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:53,876
On OS X the best way to capture
configuration information is


745
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,946
to use the system
information report.


746
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,396
And our online documentation
has some excellent steps


747
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:01,776
on how you can go about
collecting this information.


748
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:05,516
Last component, we're
going to talk


749
00:39:05,516 --> 00:39:07,456
about is the reproducibility
section.


750
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:11,516
Use this section to
specify how often is it


751
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:12,576
that you see the problem.


752
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:13,916
Do you see it always?


753
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,756
Did it only happen once
and you never were able


754
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:17,926
to reproduce it again?


755
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:21,346
Even if you did not try
to reproduce the issue,


756
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:25,136
still tell us about that because
that is still a relevant piece


757
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:25,966
of information.


758
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:28,996
With that, we have
reached the end


759
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:30,776
of the bug reporting section.


760
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,376
But let's recap what we learned.


761
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,576
We talked about why bug
reports are important.


762
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:39,656
They are a direct communication
channel between you


763
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:42,136
and an Apple engineer
so that you can tell us


764
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:44,516
about the issues you've been
running into with our software


765
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,386
and we can address
those appropriately.


766
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,766
These bug reports are read


767
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,316
and very diligently
tracked by Apple engineers.


768
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,986
The timing is important in
filing these bug reports.


769
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,266
So file as early as possible.


770
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:04,476
Also start off with well
written actionable bug reports


771
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:08,226
that are clear, concise,
succinct,


772
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:10,116
informative and constructive.


773
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,156
We also talked about a few
things you should keep in mind


774
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:15,986
to improve the chances
of your bug getting fixed


775
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:17,086
in a particular release.


776
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:20,696
With that, I like to hand it
over to Ted who's going to talk


777
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:22,716
to us about Developer
Technical Support.


778
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:23,236
Thank you.


779
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:26,826
[ Applause ]


780
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:28,046
>> Thank you Tanya.


781
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,486
So, I'm Ted Jucevic.


782
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:32,766
And I'm here to talk to you


783
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:38,956
about Developer Technical
Support.


784
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:46,986
So, Developer Technical
Support or DTS is a organization


785
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:52,466
of engineers that provide one
to one support of public APIs


786
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:57,906
through email with a guaranteed
response for developers


787
00:40:57,906 --> 00:41:03,466
of our iOS, OS X and
MFi developer programs.


788
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:04,926
So, if you have question
about how


789
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:08,466
to integrate an Apple
technology or you have a bug


790
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,526
in your app you can't resolve,
or a code level question related


791
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:16,256
to the development of your iOS
app, Mac app or MFi accessory,


792
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:20,376
we can help by providing
best practice guidance on how


793
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,616
to use our APIs and
troubleshoot.


794
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:26,176
So, when should you contact DTS?


795
00:41:26,836 --> 00:41:28,076
Before you contact DTS,


796
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:31,506
make sure you've read the
relevant documentation.


797
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,676
You've checked on
the forums to see


798
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:37,146
if your question has already
been answered by somebody else.


799
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:39,976
Write some test code.


800
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:43,496
And if appropriate,
do post your question


801
00:41:43,496 --> 00:41:44,706
to the developer forums.


802
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:50,276
But if you still need help
after you've exhausted all


803
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,976
of the resources, contact DTS.


804
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:58,556
So, you've decided that
you're going to contact DTS.


805
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:01,766
To do that, what
you need to do is go


806
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:05,576
to
developer.apple.com/membercenter


807
00:42:06,186 --> 00:42:07,766
and click on the technical link


808
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:10,476
in the developer
support section.


809
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,646
This will take you to a page
where you can request help.


810
00:42:14,336 --> 00:42:17,906
Fill out and submit the
technical support web form.


811
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:21,616
And all follow up
correspondences


812
00:42:21,616 --> 00:42:23,286
with DTS will be through email.


813
00:42:24,056 --> 00:42:28,066
So, we need a lot of the same
information that is required


814
00:42:28,306 --> 00:42:29,966
when filing a bug report.


815
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:32,596
An Xcode sample project,


816
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:37,256
Symbolicated Crash
Logs are all important.


817
00:42:37,606 --> 00:42:43,436
Now, Symbolicated Crash Logs are
crash logs that have the symbols


818
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:45,656
so the memory addresses,


819
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:49,276
translated into human
readable function names


820
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,346
and my [phonetic] numbers.


821
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,836
Many times after somebody had
some Symbolicated Crash Log,


822
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:58,016
they look at it and they
can actually figure out how


823
00:42:58,016 --> 00:42:59,286
to solve the problem themselves.


824
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:02,836
If not, when you
submit the support


825
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:05,916
for request make sure you
include the Symbolicated Crash


826
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:11,126
Log because if you have a
crash, we're going to need one.


827
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:15,276
So, I've told you about what
DTS does, how to contact DTS


828
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:16,526
and how to work with us.


829
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:23,826
Let me start off or end this
part by giving you some answers


830
00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:26,656
to some common questions
that we get in DTS.


831
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:28,866
So, all these answers
are actually


832
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:31,236
in technical note
documents that we've written.


833
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:35,976
For example, the ones that
are list on this slide are


834
00:43:35,976 --> 00:43:41,246
on the iOS Reference Library
for you to-- you can find 24/7.


835
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:46,686
The first one, iOS Debugging
Magic has a relative information


836
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:49,336
for both new and
expert developers


837
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,396
who are debugging
iOS applications.


838
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:54,266
And it's one that I would
highly recommend reading


839
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:59,576
if you have started debugging
your app, or your about to.


840
00:44:00,116 --> 00:44:01,956
The second one, understanding


841
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:04,476
and analyzing iOS
application crash reports.


842
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,276
It's important because
it explains to you how


843
00:44:08,276 --> 00:44:12,896
to symbolicate your crash logs
and also gives information


844
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:15,756
about common exceptions
or other information


845
00:44:16,266 --> 00:44:18,786
about what may be
causing your crash.


846
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:22,016
The rest of these are also
important, I'm not going to go


847
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:25,536
into them for time, but
make sure, you know,


848
00:44:26,056 --> 00:44:27,396
they're worth your
time to read them.


849
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:31,216
On the OS X side, we have
some similar documents set


850
00:44:31,216 --> 00:44:33,266
that I also recommend
you take a look at,


851
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:35,886
if you're working on
an app on the Mac.


852
00:44:37,096 --> 00:44:40,516
The Mac OS X Debugging Magic
is like the iOS version


853
00:44:41,016 --> 00:44:44,236
where it has a treasure trove
of information for both novice


854
00:44:44,236 --> 00:44:47,916
and expert developers, and
then of course the second one,


855
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,536
how to reproduce bugs report
against a Mac App Store.


856
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:53,876
Well, the title kind of explains
it completely for itself.


857
00:44:54,496 --> 00:44:56,876
So, thank you very much.


858
00:44:57,246 --> 00:45:00,296
With that let me hand
you back to Nahir.


859
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:07,036
>> So now, you've made your
app, got all the help you need


860
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:09,256
and you want to get to
it to your customers.


861
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:13,666
And you put it on the Mac App
Store or the iOS App Store.


862
00:45:14,326 --> 00:45:17,456
So for that let's go on that.


863
00:45:18,086 --> 00:45:20,426
First one is the section
that we're going to talk


864
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,376
about is the App Store.


865
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:24,596
So, we have a whole page for
developers at developer.com--


866
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,046
developer.apple.com/appstore.


867
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:30,046
And this is where you can learn
about our approval process


868
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,626
and exactly what we go about
when we're actually trying


869
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:35,356
to approve your app
to get on the Store.


870
00:45:36,456 --> 00:45:37,716
There's also where
you can and figure


871
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:38,936
out what the guidelines are


872
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,766
on what's actually
allowed in the Store.


873
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:44,086
I recommend you check that out.


874
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:46,476
We all have some other
cool stuff here as well.


875
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:48,726
So, if you've ever been on a
website and you've seen those


876
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:51,376
on the iOS or on
the App Store links,


877
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:54,416
or you've seen this really
nice product images for our--


878
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,416
some of our products, you
can actually download all


879
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,446
that on this website.


880
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:00,236
You can get full
pictures of our products,


881
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:01,316
you can get to those links.


882
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,986
And we also have some guidelines
on how these things are going


883
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:06,606
to be used, so check that out.


884
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:09,356
There's also a really
nice contact form here,


885
00:46:09,356 --> 00:46:11,016
if you have any questions
for the App Store.


886
00:46:11,486 --> 00:46:12,676
So, I [inaudible] with
all these other ways,


887
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:14,676
there's one single
place you can go


888
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:17,836
for all your communication
with the App Store.


889
00:46:18,056 --> 00:46:20,536
So, on this page, you can
get the status of your app.


890
00:46:20,596 --> 00:46:22,086
So, if you've put it
in and you're trying


891
00:46:22,086 --> 00:46:23,826
to see what's going
on, what's going


892
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:25,406
to review process,
this is where you go.


893
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:28,516
This is also where we
can get some-- get--


894
00:46:28,516 --> 00:46:31,616
give us some clarification on
an app if it's got rejected.


895
00:46:31,686 --> 00:46:32,786
Maybe someone miss something.


896
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,936
The app reviewers are people
and sometimes we make mistakes.


897
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:37,986
So this is where we can
also know what happened.


898
00:46:38,426 --> 00:46:41,506
If your app has been rejected,
there's also where you can go


899
00:46:41,506 --> 00:46:43,946
to start off with the
appeal process, because just


900
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,986
because your app has been
rejected doesn't mean they'll


901
00:46:46,986 --> 00:46:48,196
never be allowed
in the App Store.


902
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:51,076
We can work together to get
back in there or get in there.


903
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:56,096
This is also where you go to
get an expedited app review.


904
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:59,766
So, if you have an app in
the App Store right now


905
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:03,716
and you notice there's a very
horrible crash and you needed


906
00:47:03,716 --> 00:47:06,446
to get it out there, that's
where you can go to start that.


907
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:10,306
Now, just as warning, you can
do that for every single one


908
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:13,466
of your submissions to the App
Store because we kind of catch


909
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:15,066
on to that and we're
going to allow that.


910
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,156
This is also where you can go to
provide requested information.


911
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:22,396
So, say we want to host
your app or feature it,


912
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:24,626
this is where you can add some
information for there as well.


913
00:47:25,056 --> 00:47:28,156
Next we're going
to iTunes Connect.


914
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,576
And I'm sure many of
you are very familiar


915
00:47:31,576 --> 00:47:32,426
with iTunes Connect.


916
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:36,066
This is where you go
to handle everything


917
00:47:36,066 --> 00:47:39,376
about managing your app and
the business of your app.


918
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,686
This is where you can go
on to see your sales trends


919
00:47:41,686 --> 00:47:42,736
to see what's going on there.


920
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:46,046
This is also where you can go to
setup all your contracts and all


921
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:47,586
of your little tax information


922
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:48,906
and all the other
stuff that you can do.


923
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:52,616
This is also where can go to
setup iAd and all those stuff


924
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:55,736
that you need to get
ready to have ads in


925
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:57,096
and deal with the ad process.


926
00:47:58,096 --> 00:48:02,316
And also you can go in to
get In-App purchases and how


927
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:03,706
to set those things up as well.


928
00:48:04,206 --> 00:48:07,396
Now, iTunes Mac is huge


929
00:48:07,716 --> 00:48:09,996
and there's some questions
that you might have.


930
00:48:10,656 --> 00:48:12,656
So, there is a frequently
asked questions phase there


931
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:14,136
and I highly recommend
you check it out.


932
00:48:14,136 --> 00:48:15,906
There are a lot of
good information here


933
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:17,926
and you have a question there's
a very good chance that's


934
00:48:17,926 --> 00:48:18,716
answered right there.


935
00:48:18,716 --> 00:48:23,976
But if you don't want to go
through, you can also check


936
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:25,216
out the Contact Us Page.


937
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:27,806
And it's kind of nice because
got to hold drill down menu.


938
00:48:28,596 --> 00:48:32,406
So, in this case, I'm Canadian
actually, so I'm trying


939
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:35,306
to figure out what's going on
to get my, like Canadian deals


940
00:48:35,306 --> 00:48:38,336
and tax information and all
that, I can actually go in there


941
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:40,026
and say, oh, I will
have something


942
00:48:40,026 --> 00:48:43,666
with the tax information and
I'm for-- kind the tax forms.


943
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,726
And it tells me exactly
what I am to do


944
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:47,236
and where I can get
more information.


945
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,316
It also gives me some related
frequently asked questions


946
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:51,926
pages, so you can
check that out as well.


947
00:48:52,486 --> 00:49:00,006
Now, iTunes Connect as I
mentioned is a very large area,


948
00:49:00,006 --> 00:49:03,736
so we actually have gigantic
guidelines here, both for iOS


949
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:09,046
and Mac developers and I highly
recommend you check these out.


950
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:10,896
They go step by step on how


951
00:49:11,506 --> 00:49:15,706
to do multiple different
things in iTunes Connect.


952
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:22,316
So with that, coming to the end
of our presentation, so today,


953
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:25,086
hopefully we got a
bit of understanding


954
00:49:25,086 --> 00:49:26,966
of all the different developer
resources that are available


955
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:30,186
to you and when you
should actually use them.


956
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:34,976
So we went over, saw the ones
that are great for helping--


957
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:38,796
getting help yourself,
also a bunch of resources


958
00:49:39,006 --> 00:49:39,916
when you're working with Apple


959
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:43,446
and also all the
resources available to you


960
00:49:43,506 --> 00:49:47,146
for when you are
deploying your app.


961
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:51,126
We also went in-depth into
the importance of bug reports.


962
00:49:51,706 --> 00:49:53,256
We gave you a little
behind scenes of what goes


963
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,636
on with Apple engineers
when we're looking at them


964
00:49:55,636 --> 00:49:58,336
and we gave you some
really good tips on how


965
00:49:58,336 --> 00:49:59,586
to file some really great ones.


966
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:04,436
We got some links here about
some of the places or some


967
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:05,686
of the things that we discuss.


968
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:07,626
So your dev forums, app review,


969
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:14,206
etc. And here's some
excellent links


970
00:50:14,256 --> 00:50:20,036
to some technical tech notes
that Jed had mentioned, Ted.


971
00:50:20,456 --> 00:50:24,036
And here's some for
the OS X as well.


972
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:26,706
I hope you've had
a wonderful WWDC.


973
00:50:26,706 --> 00:50:28,906
I hope to see you
guys again soon.


974
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:32,500
[ Applause ]
