# WWDC Prototyping

Please note that this project is not sample code on how to work with a specific API or framework. 

In this project you will find the Keynote and Xcode source files for the prototypes tat were demonstrated in Session 223 “Prototyping: Fake It Till You Make It” at WWDC 2014.

The WWDC session focused on why you should prototype: Test ideas to save time and money building the right things and get new ideas to make the experience of your product better. This was demonstrated through picture-, animation-, and interaction-based prototypes.

The files in this project are structured into three folders, each corresponding to one of the prototyping methods demonstrated: 

1 Pictures
Make lots of different options.
Contains a Keynote file that includes all the screen prototypes shown in the presentation.

2 Animation
See how screens work together.
Contains the Keynote source files for the animation-based prototypes. Currently, the Keynote slides must be in landscape in order to display correctly on Keynote for iPhone. Included are the portrait slide decks shown in the session slides, as well as the landscape rotated decks used to produce the in-hand videos.

3 Interaction
See how it feels.
Make pictures move in response to touches on the device that you are prototyping for.
Contains the Xcode project for the interactive prototype.
Please note that the code does not follow strict Objective-C conventions in order to improve readability for designers, non-coders and non-Objective-C developers.
