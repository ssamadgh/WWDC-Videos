00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:27,106
>> Hello, everyone.


4
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,316
My name is Georgios Kontaxis,


5
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,206
and together with Katie Skinner,


6
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,606
we are both very excited to be


7
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,196
here, today, to tell you about


8
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:37,636
Privacy and your Apps.


9
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:39,726
We are members of Privacy


10
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:41,686
Engineering, Apple, and we work


11
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:43,566
with teams across the company to


12
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:44,936
deliver privacy into our


13
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:45,556
products.


14
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,046
Here, at Apple, we care about


15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,466
privacy.


16
00:00:48,126 --> 00:00:49,936
And this quote from Tim Cook


17
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,216
reflects our philosophy.


18
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:55,446
We believe that privacy is a


19
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,406
very basic foundation for a


20
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:00,566
great app ecosystem.


21
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,436
We think that great apps should


22
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,266
offer the best user experience,


23
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,486
while respecting user privacy.


24
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,276
So, today, you will hear some


25
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:12,586
best practices to design your


26
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:14,156
apps with privacy in mind.


27
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:16,896
If you have existing apps, you


28
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,446
will be very interested in


29
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,376
updates to our platforms which


30
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:21,106
might affect you.


31
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:23,006
And you will learn about some


32
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,136
exciting new privacy features


33
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,366
that Apple is launching, this


34
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:28,436
year.


35
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:31,286
We know that your apps may rely


36
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:33,016
on user data to deliver great


37
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:33,526
features.


38
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:36,216
So, it is important that you


39
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:38,676
explain to your users how you're


40
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:40,446
using their data, so they


41
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:42,626
understand what is going on and


42
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:44,496
they feel comfortable engaging


43
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:45,266
with your app.


44
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,836
Also, you need to get their


45
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:49,856
consent in the right context.


46
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,296
For example, as they're about to


47
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,156
use a feature that relies on


48
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,096
their data.


49
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,216
iOS has built-in mediation


50
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,806
mechanisms for transparency and


51
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:04,846
consent, and you should consider


52
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:08,076
how you can best take advantage


53
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,626
of them.


54
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:12,216
iOS also offers users control


55
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:12,856
over their privacy.


56
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:16,176
So, your apps need to handle


57
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:18,146
cases based on the different


58
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:20,396
privacy decisions the user might


59
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,906
make, including changing their


60
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:26,536
mind at a later time.


61
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,806
Here's an example of how Maps is


62
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,796
using the iOS built-in


63
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:33,226
mechanisms to prompt for the


64
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:34,036
user's location.


65
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,256
As you can see, when prompting


66
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,516
Maps will clearly explain the


67
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:41,516
use cases, navigation, nearby


68
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:43,736
search results, and estimated


69
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:44,426
travel times.


70
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:48,306
And if the user chooses not to


71
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:49,856
grant access to their location,


72
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:51,796
Maps is able to handle that


73
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,986
gracefully and provide a subset


74
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:54,876
of its features.


75
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,636
If a user allows Maps the user


76
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,146
location, they will be aware


77
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,506
each time that happens, because


78
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:05,506
there is an indicator in the iOS


79
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:07,266
status bar to let them know.


80
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,186
And they can always go to


81
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:11,296
Settings, Privacy, Location


82
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:13,976
Services, see that Maps is using


83
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,016
their location and perhaps,


84
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,446
revise their decision.


85
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,966
We also, know that your apps may


86
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,766
rely on identifiers, for


87
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,386
example, to personalize the user


88
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:27,646
experience or to keep track of


89
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:28,096
feedback.


90
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,626
At the same time, your users


91
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:32,786
might wonder whether their


92
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,426
actions in your app are tied to


93
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:36,976
their device or to their person.


94
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,576
Luckily, there are great ways to


95
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,946
offer privacy friendly choices,


96
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,676
so that users are comfortable


97
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:46,136
engaging with your apps.


98
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:49,736
Specifically, identifiers can be


99
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:51,686
random, they can be anonymous,


100
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:53,276
they can be short-lived, and


101
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:55,386
they can be easy to reset.


102
00:03:56,206 --> 00:04:00,396
And iOS offers built-in API for


103
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:02,326
you to be able to generate such


104
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,216
identifiers.


105
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,126
So, you should adopt those


106
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:07,126
instead of building your own.


107
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,216
As an example, consider the


108
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,356
Universally Unique Identifier.


109
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:16,206
It is a random 128-bit value,


110
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,346
which you can generate using the


111
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,685
Swift code, shown here.


112
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:22,576
And as you can see, three


113
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,906
consecutive calls using this API


114
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,686
will return three random


115
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,136
unrelated values.


116
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:31,376
And for example, you could


117
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,556
leverage the UIDs to generate


118
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,406
short-lived identifiers.


119
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:38,396
For example, you can associate a


120
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,176
new UUID with each session in


121
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:43,056
your app.


122
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:45,606
Another example is the vendor


123
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:46,206
identifier.


124
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:48,736
It is a more stable identifier,


125
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:51,456
because it is consistent across


126
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,556
all apps associated with the


127
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,366
same team.


128
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:57,416
As you can see, here, in the


129
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,516
example table, two apps that


130
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:02,216
belong to the same team all


131
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,316
generate the same vendor


132
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:07,016
identifier, while a third app


133
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:08,956
belonging to a different team


134
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,056
will have its own.


135
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,336
Also, keep in mind that if all


136
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:16,236
apps belonging to a particular


137
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,186
team are uninstalled from the


138
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,896
user's device and later


139
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:22,466
reinstalled, they will get a new


140
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:22,996
identifier.


141
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:26,636
Now, let's talk about collecting


142
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,926
data to enable your features.


143
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,666
Collecting data can be a


144
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,496
benefit, but also, carries


145
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:34,056
risks.


146
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:38,976
So, users might be uncomfortable


147
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,306
giving too much of their data,


148
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:42,946
if you do not sufficiently


149
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,296
justify the purpose.


150
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,146
And also, consider the burden on


151
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,846
your end to manage all that data


152
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,656
and keep it safe.


153
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:53,266
So, you should consider


154
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:55,866
aggregating data, summarizing


155
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,426
it, and extracting only the


156
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:59,126
information you need.


157
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:02,216
As an alternative, think whether


158
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,916
a sample of the data would


159
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,926
suffice, or whether you can


160
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,576
process the data on device


161
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:11,966
instead of sending their all


162
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,546
values to your server.


163
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,056
And later in this talk, you will


164
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:17,656
hear about some great new ways


165
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:20,426
to process data on device, using


166
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:23,966
iOS hardware and software.


167
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:25,966
Collecting raw data might reveal


168
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,756
additional information about the


169
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:28,356
users.


170
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,526
And as mentioned, this is


171
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,526
information that neither your


172
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,266
users nor you might want to


173
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:34,546
have.


174
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:36,786
As an example, consider you have


175
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:39,036
a new feature in your app, and


176
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:40,126
you're going to collect feedback


177
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,706
to see how successful it is.


178
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:44,766
So, you could instrument your


179
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:47,576
app to send back a timestamp to


180
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,636
your server each time the users


181
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:50,656
engage with your feature.


182
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,726
And that would give you the


183
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:54,726
information you're after.


184
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,966
But if you were to plot that


185
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,146
data over a timeline, you could


186
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,316
also learn that user one is a


187
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:03,376
morning person, because all of


188
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:04,776
their timestamps are in the


189
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:05,206
morning.


190
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:07,656
And user three opens your app at


191
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:07,936
night.


192
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:11,656
So, another way to collect this


193
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:12,976
information would be to say,


194
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:15,996
''Well, I will have my app count


195
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,536
the total number of times that a


196
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:21,236
particular user engages with my


197
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:23,186
feature, and send that count


198
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,626
back to my server, once a day.''


199
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,136
And that is a more privacy


200
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,366
friendly way to learn the same


201
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,586
information about the feature,


202
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:34,046
whether it's a customer or not.


203
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,426
But if you pay attention, you


204
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:37,996
might realize that now you know


205
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:40,956
that user one likes your feature


206
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:44,386
the most, among your users.


207
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,416
And that's not the question you


208
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,296
were trying to answer.


209
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:49,866
So, if you were to rephrase the


210
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,666
question as, ''How many users


211
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,916
engage with my feature more than


212
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,736
ten times a day?'' you could


213
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,486
have your app send back to your


214
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:00,996
server, a Boolean flag, yes or


215
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,676
no, whether the user has


216
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:04,406
exceeded that threshold within


217
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:04,746
the day.


218
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:08,056
And on your end, on the server,


219
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,116
you could calculate the


220
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,866
percentage of users that have


221
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,756
exceeded the threshold.


222
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:15,866
In this particular case, 66%.


223
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,396
Keep that percentage on your


224
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,056
server, keep track of it over


225
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:21,596
time as it changes, to


226
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:22,796
understand how your feature


227
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:26,926
behaves, and discard any user


228
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:29,576
specific data.


229
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,516
So, now let's go over some


230
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,746
updates which might affect your


231
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:34,176
apps.


232
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,385
I mentioned, earlier, that when


233
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,726
apps ask for access to user data


234
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:43,246
iOS will prompt users for their


235
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:43,616
consent.


236
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,216
And there are cases where we


237
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:48,946
think that users need as much


238
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,956
information as possible to make


239
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:51,656
this decision.


240
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,056
And your app is responsible for


241
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,146
providing this additional


242
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:56,706
context.


243
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,316
This additional context is in


244
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:00,646
the form of Purpose Strings.


245
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,496
And Purpose Strings are included


246
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:04,356
in the prompt shown to the user


247
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,216
by iOS.


248
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:07,456
Purpose Strings are defined as


249
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:10,046
keys in the Info.plist file of


250
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:10,456
your app.


251
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:15,116
And you can define those keys in


252
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:15,976
Xcode, like so.


253
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:20,066
Keep in mind that those keys are


254
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,106
mandatory.


255
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,466
So, if your app is missing a


256
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:26,186
Purpose String and tries to


257
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:29,586
access related data, it will


258
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,686
terminate with an error message


259
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,816
indicating which key is missing.


260
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:38,076
In iOS 10, these are the cases


261
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,026
where Purpose Strings are


262
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:39,456
required.


263
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,956
And in iOS 11, we are making


264
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:46,196
changes to Location, Photos, and


265
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,406
we're adding a Purpose String


266
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:49,166
for Core NFC.


267
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,026
Core location has enabled great


268
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,296
features in your apps.


269
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:59,706
Users appreciate being able to


270
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:03,706
navigate the world and find


271
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:05,516
interesting places through their


272
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:05,916
iOS device.


273
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:10,296
At the same time, we want users


274
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,076
to always be in control of their


275
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:12,556
privacy.


276
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:18,346
So, in iOS 10 apps can ask for


277
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:20,456
access to the user's location at


278
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:22,986
all times, or while the app is


279
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,146
in use.


280
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:29,526
In iOS 11 users will be able to


281
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,486
choose the When In Use option at


282
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:33,156
all times.


283
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:41,236
[ Applause ]


284
00:10:41,736 --> 00:10:43,246
What this means for you, is that


285
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:47,006
your app will have to account


286
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:49,076
for cases where the user's


287
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:51,116
location is not available to


288
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:51,276
you.


289
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,926
And you need to define


290
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,556
additional Purpose Strings for


291
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:55,466
the When In Use option.


292
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:59,306
As a reminder, when asking for


293
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:01,226
the user location make sure you


294
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,446
do it in a meaningful way.


295
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:06,106
Make sure you prompt after the


296
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:07,876
user has engaged the feature


297
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,796
that requires their location, so


298
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:10,926
they understand why they're


299
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:12,126
being asked for their location.


300
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,406
When you prompt, make sure your


301
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:16,546
Purpose String provides the


302
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,406
necessary information for the


303
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:20,436
user to make a good decision.


304
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:24,336
And if possible, try asking for


305
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:26,776
When In Use, and escalate to


306
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:29,126
Always after the user has some


307
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:31,586
time to experience your feature.


308
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:36,996
If you have an app on iOS 10


309
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,416
that does not support the When


310
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,546
In Use option, this is the


311
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:43,836
prompt the user will see when


312
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,566
they upgrade to iOS 11.


313
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,526
As you can see, they can choose


314
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:50,656
the When In Use option, but


315
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:51,966
there is a warning that the app


316
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,526
does not natively support it.


317
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,556
If you have an app on iOS 10


318
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,996
that does support both the When


319
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,876
In Use and the Always option,


320
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:05,946
this is the prompt you will see.


321
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:08,236
Both Purpose Strings will be


322
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:09,886
included in the prompt shown to


323
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:10,346
the user.


324
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,886
You should update your apps to


325
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,336
feature a single Purpose String.


326
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:17,696
And you can do that by defining


327
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,106
a single key in your Info.plist


328
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,136
file, and use the Always and


329
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,936
When In Use key.


330
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:27,106
So now, let's talk about Photos.


331
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:29,366
The user's Photos library


332
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:30,986
contains a lot of information.


333
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,976
And we want you to be able to


334
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:35,506
leverage that information to


335
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:36,516
deliver great features.


336
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,716
At the same time, we want to


337
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,266
maintain a high level of user


338
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:40,796
privacy.


339
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,816
So, this year, we're adding two


340
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:46,076
new ways for your apps to


341
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:47,526
interact with the Photos


342
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:47,976
library.


343
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,356
Specifically, users will be able


344
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,986
to open a photo in your app


345
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,516
without the need for you to


346
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,296
prompt for access to their


347
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:59,116
entire Photos library.


348
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:02,956
So, this will make them more


349
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:04,706
comfortable using your app,


350
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,886
because they will have better


351
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,406
control over their data.


352
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:12,456
We're also, adding a Write only


353
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:14,476
access to the Photos library.


354
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:16,916
So, for example, if there's a


355
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,376
game that wants to save a


356
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:20,016
screenshot of the user


357
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,236
achievements, it can prompt for


358
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,906
Write, but not Read access to


359
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:25,736
the Photos library.


360
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:28,456
And users might be more willing


361
00:13:28,456 --> 00:13:29,566
to grant that request.


362
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,176
And because of these changes,


363
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:37,136
when users upgrade their devices


364
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:39,916
to iOS 11, existing apps will


365
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,966
re-prompt for access to the


366
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:42,646
Photos library.


367
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:44,676
If you want users to be able to


368
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:47,006
take advantage of this ability


369
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,086
to open Photos in your app


370
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:52,476
without being prompted, you can


371
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:54,666
adopt the Out Of Process Image


372
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,706
Picker, and to find out more,


373
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,906
please visit the Photos session.


374
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:03,576
This is a great way to add a


375
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,996
photo in a user's profile or use


376
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,016
a photo in some other rare


377
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:08,776
action in your app.


378
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:11,786
Now let's look at the Write 0nly


379
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:12,366
case.


380
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:15,556
There is a prompt and a Purpose


381
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,566
String, so if you want to adopt


382
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,626
this, you need to decode the


383
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:19,176
Purpose String.


384
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:23,386
And make sure you provide enough


385
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:24,936
information for the users to


386
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:27,696
decide whether they want to use


387
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:28,186
this feature.


388
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:31,516
Now, let's talk about Core NFC.


389
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,196
CoreNFC is a new and exciting


390
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:36,876
iOS 11 framework, which allows


391
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,676
your app to use NFC reader modes


392
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:42,536
to interact with nearby NFC


393
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:42,886
tags.


394
00:14:43,576 --> 00:14:45,576
So now, you can use NFC tags in


395
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:47,366
your app in novel and


396
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,306
interesting ways.


397
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:52,306
To adopt CoreNFC, you need to


398
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:54,116
declare the corresponding


399
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:55,926
Purpose String and provide the


400
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:56,916
necessary context.


401
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,776
And this Purpose String will be


402
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,386
included in the prompt shown to


403
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:03,826
the user every time your app


404
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,276
invokes CoreNFC.


405
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:08,536
Now, let's talk about the watch.


406
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:10,876
We want your apps to be able to


407
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,136
do more with the watch.


408
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:15,126
So, this year, we're expanding


409
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:16,496
the use of the microphone.


410
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:21,466
Today, in iOS 10, your app can


411
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:24,036
ask for microphone access, and


412
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,136
following the user's consent, it


413
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:28,756
can start recording audio while


414
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:29,536
in the foreground.


415
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:31,656
In the new version of watchOS,


416
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:34,316
you will be able to keep


417
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,866
recording while in the


418
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:36,296
background.


419
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:37,986
And if you stay in the


420
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:40,536
foreground you will be able to


421
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,116
use the new API to record audio


422
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:47,706
without showing the built-in UI.


423
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,436
Because we want users to always


424
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:51,056
be aware that their microphone


425
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,646
is active, if your app is in the


426
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:55,356
background, there will be an


427
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:56,856
indicator on the watch face.


428
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:58,826
And if the user taps on the


429
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,776
indicator your app will enter


430
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:01,286
the foreground.


431
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:04,886
Let's talk about Music.


432
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:09,576
We want your apps to be able to


433
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,396
take advantage of Music and


434
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:12,956
create great features.


435
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:16,936
So, part of this experience is


436
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:19,816
having a frictionless way to


437
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:21,746
authenticate the user while


438
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:22,806
respecting their privacy.


439
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:24,786
So, for example, if an app were


440
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:26,536
to ask for the user's password


441
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,486
to Music, that would be a


442
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:29,376
privacy concern.


443
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,676
Instead, apps should leverage


444
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,106
the fact that the users are


445
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:37,326
already signed into Music on


446
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:37,776
iOS.


447
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:43,906
And iOS has a built-in mediation


448
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:46,336
mechanism for giving your apps


449
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,376
access to a Music token.


450
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:50,686
Following the user's consent,


451
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:53,456
you can get that token and use


452
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:58,756
it to access output APIs to


453
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:02,636
retrieve personalized and


454
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:04,116
non-personalized information.


455
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:07,215
For example, search the iTunes


456
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:09,935
catalog or get information about


457
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:10,846
the user's library.


458
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:14,536
And remember, because the user


459
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,036
will have control over which


460
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,866
apps get this token, make sure


461
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,486
you provide the necessary


462
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:22,876
context in the Purpose String


463
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,356
for users to understand what you


464
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:25,976
want to do with it.


465
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:29,616
Now, let's talk about Safari


466
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,136
View Controller.


467
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,946
Safari View Controller is a


468
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:33,676
great way for users to browse


469
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:34,976
the web in your apps.


470
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:40,466
And in iOS 10 Safari cookies and


471
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,886
website data were available in


472
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,976
SVC instances, in Safari View


473
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,836
Controller instances, in your


474
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:47,236
apps.


475
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,446
This will change.


476
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,996
Now, in iOS 11 users will be


477
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:56,566
able to use an account to log in


478
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,756
a website in your app and


479
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:00,346
perhaps, use a different account


480
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,086
if they want to, to log into the


481
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,066
same website in Safari, or some


482
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:04,626
other app.


483
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,456
And we think that gives users


484
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:08,196
more control.


485
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:10,486
Specifically, what this means is


486
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,806
that Safari and Safari View


487
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:14,846
Controller instances will have


488
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:17,486
separate data stores for cookies


489
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:18,736
and other website's data.


490
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,186
And what this means for you and


491
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,876
your users, is that they will


492
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,936
still be able to browse the web


493
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:26,496
in your app the same way as


494
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:26,916
before.


495
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,596
But they may have to login,


496
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,706
again, to some of the sites they


497
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:32,446
visit.


498
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,486
This is what it looks like.


499
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,276
So, for example, I have


500
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:41,566
Apple.com cookies in Safari, and


501
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:44,006
I have different cookies in your


502
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:44,416
app.


503
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:48,226
So, this concludes the updates.


504
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,246
At this point, I would like to


505
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,236
invite Katie onstage to tell you


506
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:53,716
all about some exciting new


507
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,546
privacy features that Apple is


508
00:18:55,546 --> 00:18:56,266
launching, this year.


509
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:57,206
Katie.


510
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:02,626
[ Applause ]


511
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,186
>> Thank you, Georgios.


512
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:06,656
Now, I'm going to focus on some


513
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,756
new privacy features, as well as


514
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:09,906
provide an update on


515
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:11,736
differential privacy, that we


516
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:12,836
introduced last year.


517
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:15,026
I'm going to start with on


518
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,126
device processing.


519
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,516
Now, On-Device processing has a


520
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:19,916
lot of benefits.


521
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:21,456
One of the first ones, is it


522
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:23,686
enables your functionality to


523
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,586
run anywhere your users are.


524
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:27,136
Whether they're at the beach,


525
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:29,316
like this, or on an airplane


526
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,706
flight, or even in areas of poor


527
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,226
cellular connectivity.


528
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:36,636
It also, avoids network latency,


529
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:38,986
as depending on where your users


530
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,186
are, this may take longer than


531
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:42,786
the actual processing that you


532
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:43,826
want to accomplish.


533
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:47,116
The speed of our devices, your


534
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:49,506
iPhones, our iPads, it keeps


535
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,256
increasing and increasing.


536
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:56,916
The iPhone 7 is 120 times the


537
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,916
processing power of the original


538
00:19:58,916 --> 00:19:59,336
iPhone.


539
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:02,996
So, think through the different


540
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,566
tasks that you once thought were


541
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,986
not feasible on device, and you


542
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:07,876
should reconsider.


543
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,136
Now, as you all are at the


544
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,776
privacy session, I'm going to


545
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:13,856
talk a little bit more about the


546
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,946
privacy related benefits of


547
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:17,116
On-Device processing.


548
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,646
One of the first ones is access


549
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:21,256
to user data.


550
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,546
So, there are many different


551
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:24,896
types of sensitive data on


552
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:25,356
device.


553
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,226
And when you're clear to your


554
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,556
users about how you plan to use


555
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:29,996
that data.


556
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,946
Like for instance, if you tell


557
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:34,996
your users that the photo that


558
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:37,596
you take, if you apply a nice


559
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:40,026
halo on it, maybe a filter, that


560
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:41,416
stays on their device.


561
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:43,856
Until they choose to share it


562
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,886
with another user, or maybe back


563
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:46,566
it up with you.


564
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:49,046
Then, users are going to be more


565
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:51,396
likely to want to grant you


566
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:53,086
access to their data, and feel


567
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,606
more comfortable about it.


568
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,536
On-Device, you can also take


569
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,316
advantage of all the different


570
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,426
security features that are built


571
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,596
into our platforms.


572
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:05,566
These are things like data


573
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:08,196
protection, the Keychain, that


574
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:10,826
allow you to more securely take


575
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:12,926
care of user's data, without you


576
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:14,126
having to implement it,


577
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:14,456
yourself.


578
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:17,796
Now, in past developer sessions,


579
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:19,726
they're a great resource for you


580
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:22,026
to go and learn more about these


581
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:23,026
security features.


582
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25,106
I would encourage you to go


583
00:21:25,106 --> 00:21:27,076
check out ''Protecting Secrets


584
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:27,786
With the Keychain''.


585
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,206
It's a great place to start.


586
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,036
Now, when you're using and


587
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:34,976
keeping the data on device, that


588
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:36,516
means you don't have to write


589
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:39,786
code to send that data to your


590
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:40,326
server.


591
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:43,306
You don't have to write code to


592
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:45,916
securely manage and make sure


593
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,356
that, that data on your server


594
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:48,456
is secure.


595
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,786
Now, you all know the less code


596
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:54,086
you have to write, that means


597
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:54,846
the less bugs.


598
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:58,116
And the less bugs are less bugs


599
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,336
that an attacker can take


600
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:00,086
advantage of.


601
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:02,776
Because a data breach is very


602
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,056
serious, and there are a lot of


603
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,096
consequences.


604
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:07,356
But one of the consequences is


605
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:09,346
the loss of user trust.


606
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,416
Now, technologies like this can


607
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:15,566
help you avoid that, as well.


608
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:18,876
Now, I'm going to talk about


609
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,736
four new frameworks that allow


610
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:24,376
you to do these common tasks on


611
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:24,826
device.


612
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,436
Now, any type of processing that


613
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:29,926
you do within your app, you can


614
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:30,956
move to on device.


615
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,666
But here are four frameworks


616
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:33,656
that make it easier.


617
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:36,536
The first one is CoreML, Core


618
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:37,336
Machine Learning.


619
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:40,306
Now, this allows you to have a


620
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:42,216
simple interface to load and run


621
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:43,306
pretrained models.


622
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,296
There a lot of different models


623
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:46,136
that it supports.


624
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:47,996
But one of them is neural


625
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:48,396
networks.


626
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:50,836
The second framework I'm going


627
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,106
to talk about is VisionKit.


628
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:54,756
Now, VisionKit allows you to


629
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:57,276
identify faces within a photo,


630
00:22:58,096 --> 00:22:59,266
as well as do scene


631
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:02,626
classification, and group photos


632
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:04,816
by the contents of the scene and


633
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:05,276
time.


634
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:08,316
One of the ones that I'm most


635
00:23:08,316 --> 00:23:09,986
excited about is ARKit.


636
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,246
I think augmented reality is a


637
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:13,326
place where there's lots of


638
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:14,496
exciting things to come.


639
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:16,046
And I can't wait to get it in


640
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:17,916
all of your hands, to see what


641
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,396
kind of experiences you guys


642
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:20,726
create for our users.


643
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:24,276
Now, ARKit can allow you to


644
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:26,666
locate the device, as well as


645
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,966
items in the real world.


646
00:23:28,556 --> 00:23:29,926
And then, it allows you to


647
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,976
augment on top of a camera


648
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:32,556
stream.


649
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,376
Now, lastly, we have NLP,


650
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:37,766
Natural Language Processing.


651
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:39,856
This allows you to identify what


652
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:42,316
language a customer may have be


653
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:43,556
entering text with, then.


654
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,486
And it also allows you to do


655
00:23:45,486 --> 00:23:47,586
tokenization, as well as named


656
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:49,096
entity recognition.


657
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:51,666
Now, I'd encourage you to go


658
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,616
check out the talk introducing


659
00:23:53,616 --> 00:23:56,566
CoreML, later this afternoon.


660
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:59,416
This will provide an overview of


661
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:02,126
the different features available


662
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:03,466
that you can take advantage of


663
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:04,106
on device.


664
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:07,976
Next, I'm going to talk about a


665
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:11,516
new framework available in iOS


666
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:11,816
and tvOS.


667
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:13,916
It's called Device Check.


668
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:16,846
Now, there are many developers


669
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:18,546
who are currently using a


670
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:20,666
variety of techniques to try to


671
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,876
identify devices.


672
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:24,386
Now, they may be trying to


673
00:24:24,386 --> 00:24:26,226
identify and answer questions


674
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:28,676
like, ''Has this device received


675
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,376
a free trial?


676
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,466
Has this device participated in


677
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:35,116
fraudulent activity?'' Or, ''Has


678
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:37,416
this device done something that


679
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,716
is against your app's developer


680
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:43,406
guidelines?'' Now, in order to


681
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:44,926
achieve that goal, many


682
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:46,386
developers, though, I'm sure


683
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,726
none of you in this room, may be


684
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:50,756
collecting lots of information


685
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:52,856
in order to associate some state


686
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:54,976
with that device.


687
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:58,256
Now, to do that, they may be


688
00:24:58,256 --> 00:24:59,696
collecting lots of information


689
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:01,596
like, how's the device set up?


690
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:04,266
What information is stored on


691
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:05,986
it?


692
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:07,496
And these developers may not


693
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:08,756
want to have this level of


694
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:09,536
information.


695
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:12,266
All they want to do is associate


696
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:13,926
some state with that device, in


697
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:14,526
particular.


698
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,806
Now, DeviceCheck allows you to


699
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:20,626
associate state with the device.


700
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:22,866
And this is done in a privacy


701
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:24,766
friendly way that you can


702
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,186
achieve without collecting


703
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:27,996
unnecessary information.


704
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:30,676
Now, DeviceCheck allows you to


705
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,586
store two bits of information,


706
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:34,156
as well as a timestamp


707
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:35,996
associated with one device.


708
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:38,356
And this is per team ID.


709
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:45,396
So, you can store 00, 01, 10, or


710
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,816
11.


711
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:49,076
And it's up to you to think


712
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:52,966
about what this means to your


713
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:56,896
application and your app logic.


714
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:59,856
Now, this information will be


715
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:02,886
maintained by Apple through


716
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:05,646
until you reset it, or you


717
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:06,786
update the state.


718
00:26:07,236 --> 00:26:08,766
So, this means it will be stored


719
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,796
by Apple through deletion of


720
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:13,506
your app, reinstallation of your


721
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,846
app, through erase all contents


722
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:18,356
and settings, as well as


723
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:20,536
transfer of that device between


724
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:20,966
users.


725
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:23,436
Now, we know users sell devices


726
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:23,906
to others.


727
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:25,946
We know they transfer them to


728
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:27,496
other siblings or other people


729
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:27,956
they know.


730
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,756
So, this information will be


731
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,756
maintained through that.


732
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,046
Now, as I mentioned before, it's


733
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:36,056
up to you to figure out what


734
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,246
these states mean to you.


735
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:40,686
So, an example would be for app


736
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,526
A, if a user has completed a


737
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:45,076
free trial they will be assigned


738
00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:46,126
state 01.


739
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:48,486
Now, you could have a different


740
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:49,386
app, app B.


741
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:51,526
And that same information, that


742
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:53,256
same state that a free trial has


743
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:55,346
been assigned or completed could


744
00:26:55,346 --> 00:26:56,596
be assigned 11.


745
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:58,646
It's up to you to make that


746
00:26:58,646 --> 00:26:59,126
decision.


747
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:01,786
Now, I want to go through the


748
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,946
flow and make sure you guys


749
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:05,466
understand how this works in


750
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:06,096
practice.


751
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:07,956
So, let's say there's an app


752
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:09,486
that's a news app.


753
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:11,026
And like I said before, it


754
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,766
grants a seven day free trial.


755
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,856
So, when my free trial is


756
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:18,116
completed the app wants to set


757
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:19,896
my state to 01.


758
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:21,756
So, first thing it's going to do


759
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:23,286
is query for a device check


760
00:27:23,386 --> 00:27:25,776
token on device, send it to


761
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:28,046
their app server, and then via


762
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:30,046
server communication set the


763
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:31,406
state and send it to Apple.


764
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,556
So, send over the token and the


765
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:36,916
state that wants to be set.


766
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:39,966
So, then I decide that maybe I'm


767
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:41,506
not a huge fan of that news app,


768
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:41,846
anymore.


769
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,106
I want to delete it.


770
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:46,236
But then, I miss it couple of


771
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:47,946
weeks later, so I decide I'm


772
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:49,946
going to reinstall the app.


773
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:52,026
On launch, that app wants to


774
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:55,586
decide, ''should that user or


775
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:56,936
that device be given another


776
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:57,586
free trial''?


777
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:01,216
So, query for the token, send it


778
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,446
to the app server the same way,


779
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:04,226
and this time query for the


780
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,346
state of the device.


781
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:10,446
So, then because that device was


782
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:12,856
last set as 01, it will be sent


783
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:13,816
back to the app server.


784
00:28:13,906 --> 00:28:15,946
And at that point it's the app's


785
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,106
job to figure out what to do,


786
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:17,266
next.


787
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:19,986
Should that device be granted


788
00:28:19,986 --> 00:28:20,906
another free trial?


789
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:23,826
Should that device be granted,


790
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:24,926
maybe, a shorter trial?


791
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,696
Or no trial at all?


792
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:29,386
It's up to you to make that


793
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:31,556
decision.


794
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:34,126
So, as I said before, devices


795
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:35,576
can transfer between users.


796
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:37,776
So, let's say I sell my device


797
00:28:37,776 --> 00:28:38,866
to Georgios, because I want a


798
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:39,316
different phone.


799
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:41,556
I want a new gold one, this


800
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:42,396
time.


801
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:45,126
So, then Georgios wants to


802
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:46,036
install the same app.


803
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,306
He likes the same news app.


804
00:28:47,796 --> 00:28:49,086
So, it's going to query for the


805
00:28:49,086 --> 00:28:51,036
token the same way, send it to


806
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:53,316
its app server, and then, query


807
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,146
for the state.


808
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,426
Again, 01 will be returned.


809
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,816
And this case, Georgios has not


810
00:29:00,926 --> 00:29:01,896
gotten a free trial.


811
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:03,366
So, you need to think about how


812
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,836
to handle these type of cases.


813
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:08,486
Now, make sure that you have a


814
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:10,246
way that customers can reach out


815
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:12,676
or escalate if they are


816
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:14,236
experiencing issues with this.


817
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,026
And they need to come and reach


818
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:18,406
out to you, because at Apple, we


819
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,576
don't have any idea what these


820
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:21,756
states correspond to.


821
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:25,346
So now, I'm going to quickly go


822
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,466
through what a sample query


823
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:26,956
could look like.


824
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:29,026
As you can see, here's the


825
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:31,236
device token, the transaction


826
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,336
ID, which you generate, as well


827
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:33,996
as a timestamp.


828
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:36,736
Then, here's the response from


829
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:37,906
Apple with the state.


830
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:41,416
And then, if you want to update


831
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,356
the state, again have the device


832
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:46,726
token, your transaction ID that


833
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:48,286
you generate, as well as the


834
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,686
timestamp and the state you want


835
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:51,756
to set.


836
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:53,346
When you're using DeviceCheck


837
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,096
make sure to think through these


838
00:29:55,096 --> 00:29:55,926
best practices.


839
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:58,646
Make sure you handle the case


840
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,306
where devices are transferred


841
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:00,976
between users.


842
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:04,696
A device's behavior can change


843
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:05,376
over time.


844
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,046
Additionally, think about the


845
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:09,056
recency of the data.


846
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,516
If the state was set a year,


847
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,516
ago, maybe that means something


848
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:15,196
different to you than if it was


849
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:15,816
this month.


850
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:18,606
This should be part of your


851
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,616
app's logic, but not the sole


852
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:21,106
source.


853
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:22,856
And think through how you


854
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,396
represent this state in the UI.


855
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:26,796
When Georgios goes to launch the


856
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:28,296
app for the first time, you want


857
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:29,686
to have a fresh experience for


858
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:29,976
him.


859
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:31,786
So, make sure you think through


860
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:32,526
that.


861
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,576
Now, you should be using


862
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:37,856
platform supported identifiers.


863
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:39,876
These are the application


864
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,576
identifier, the vendor


865
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:43,116
identifier, as well as the


866
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,456
advertising identifier.


867
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:47,296
We will continue to remove and


868
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,286
to remove entropy on our


869
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:50,546
out-of-the-app sandbox.


870
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:53,026
And as we have before, we will


871
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:54,566
continue to identify areas of


872
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:57,486
entropy and put them either


873
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,146
behind user control or remove


874
00:30:59,146 --> 00:30:59,436
them.


875
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:03,896
Next, I'm going to talk about


876
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:06,076
Intelligent Tracking Protection.


877
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:08,096
This year, we're working to


878
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:10,466
reduce cross-web tracking.


879
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:14,156
Now, since the beginning, WebKit


880
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:15,626
and Safari have been leaders in


881
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:16,516
user privacy.


882
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:19,246
One example of this is blocking


883
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,936
third party cookies by default.


884
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:23,756
Now, I want to get this out


885
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,236
there, that Intelligent Tracking


886
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:26,796
Protection is not about blocking


887
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:27,226
content.


888
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,796
That's not what this technology


889
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:30,536
is.


890
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:33,016
It dynamically detects online


891
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,916
tracking across the sites that a


892
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:35,786
user visits.


893
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:37,786
And using an on-device


894
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,756
classifier, it will identify


895
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:40,756
tracking domains.


896
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:42,606
Once a tracking domain is


897
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:45,116
identified, then it will isolate


898
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:47,246
the third party cookies, as well


899
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:49,656
as website data for that


900
00:31:49,656 --> 00:31:49,966
website.


901
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:52,166
And then, periodically, that


902
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,376
data will be purged.


903
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,306
Now, if the user interacts with


904
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:58,306
that domain, that is taken as a


905
00:31:58,346 --> 00:31:59,726
signal that the user is


906
00:31:59,726 --> 00:32:00,986
interested in that website.


907
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,016
And then, that website will be


908
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:03,686
whitelisted.


909
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,856
So, let's go through an example.


910
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:10,116
So, if example.com is identified


911
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:11,746
as a tracker, and the user


912
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:13,666
visits site 1, that embeds


913
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,046
example.com, example.com will


914
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:16,986
set the cookie foo.


915
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,256
Now, a user goes to site 2,


916
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,386
which also embeds example.com,


917
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:25,066
but here, example.com does not


918
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,176
have access to the cookie foo.


919
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,666
So, then it will set cookie bar.


920
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:31,596
And then, over time these


921
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:34,186
cookies will be purged.


922
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:37,986
Now, no cookies will be deleted


923
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:39,526
from first party websites.


924
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:41,496
Additionally, if the user


925
00:32:41,496 --> 00:32:43,016
interacts with your website via


926
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:46,066
click, a tap, entering a form,


927
00:32:46,656 --> 00:32:48,686
then note it will be


928
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:49,356
whitelisted.


929
00:32:50,646 --> 00:32:53,066
You should not rely on storage


930
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:55,316
if the user does not interact


931
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:56,306
with your website.


932
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:59,456
And this is an important one to


933
00:32:59,456 --> 00:33:01,976
understand; if your analytics


934
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:03,856
package relies on third party


935
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:08,806
cookies, they may be affected.


936
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:09,916
So, what we're trying to


937
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,796
achieve, here, is that users


938
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:14,056
only have long-term persistent


939
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:16,396
tracking and cookies from sites


940
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,056
that they actually intersect


941
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:18,276
with.


942
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:21,126
They actually interact with.


943
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,926
And then, all the other tracking


944
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:24,826
as the user navigates and visits


945
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:27,116
websites will be proactively


946
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:27,846
removed.


947
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:31,846
Lastly, we have an update on


948
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:33,036
Differential Privacy.


949
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:36,026
So, Differential Privacy was


950
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:38,996
launched on iOS and macOS, last


951
00:33:38,996 --> 00:33:39,116
year.


952
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:42,176
Since then, we've collected


953
00:33:42,176 --> 00:33:44,456
millions of privately donated


954
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,536
data per day, and it allowed us


955
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:49,336
to build user features with


956
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:49,886
privacy.


957
00:33:49,886 --> 00:33:53,576
Now, I want to talk about two


958
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:54,806
new use cases, this year.


959
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:58,876
The first one is collecting what


960
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:00,856
data is commonly stored in


961
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:01,376
HealthKit.


962
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:03,676
Now, one of the challenges of


963
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:05,606
working on sensitive features,


964
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:07,376
or features that have sensitive


965
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:09,565
data, is you want to understand


966
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:10,936
how those features are being


967
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:11,396
used.


968
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:13,536
You want to understand what's


969
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:15,136
resonating, where users are


970
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,866
falling into issues or errors


971
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:17,505
are occurring.


972
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,466
But you know that collecting


973
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:21,956
data about what they're actually


974
00:34:21,956 --> 00:34:23,626
interacting with may have more


975
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:24,676
information than you really


976
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:24,996
need.


977
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:28,076
So, one example here is, if you


978
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:30,295
collect what type of data, what


979
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:32,666
data types the user has stored


980
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:34,716
on their device, things like


981
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:35,835
blood glucose.


982
00:34:35,896 --> 00:34:37,786
Things like Workout, that could


983
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:39,136
convey other additional


984
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:41,516
information about their health


985
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,906
or about any conditions they


986
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:45,366
have, or how active they are.


987
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:47,056
And we don't really need that


988
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:48,116
level of information.


989
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:50,056
So, that's why it's so exciting


990
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,386
to have Differential Privacy at


991
00:34:51,386 --> 00:34:53,735
Apple, because we can still get


992
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:55,246
information to continue to


993
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:57,246
iterate and build our features,


994
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,306
while respecting user privacy.


995
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,806
So, last year in the Privacy


996
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:04,056
session at the Developer


997
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:05,346
Conference, Julian [assumed


998
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:06,186
spelling] did a great job


999
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:07,476
deep-diving into how


1000
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:08,956
Differential Privacy works at


1001
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:09,236
Apple.


1002
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:13,406
Basically, we collect privatized


1003
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:16,426
donations like emoji, and as


1004
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:18,116
more and more users contribute


1005
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,896
these privatized emojis, we


1006
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:21,546
learn what are the most popular


1007
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:22,666
emojis.


1008
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:25,766
But the key part here, is we


1009
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,056
learned nothing that's


1010
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:28,536
associated by an individual


1011
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:28,956
user.


1012
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:31,416
For more information about how


1013
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:32,726
Differential Privacy works at


1014
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:34,146
Apple, I would encourage you all


1015
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,346
to look at our session from last


1016
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:37,486
year's Developer's Conference.


1017
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:42,256
So, this year we're applying the


1018
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:44,096
same process to health data


1019
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:44,446
types.


1020
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:46,416
So, we will learn the most


1021
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,376
popular health data types, but


1022
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:49,606
with learning nothing about the


1023
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,696
individual user.


1024
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:56,976
The second case is trying to


1025
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:59,826
learn websites that either are


1026
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,356
very slow or take up a lot of


1027
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:03,216
battery life.


1028
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:05,976
We all want a fast, speedy web.


1029
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,646
But we don't necessarily want to


1030
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:11,456
learn everything that a user is


1031
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:11,986
visiting.


1032
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:13,886
That's a lot of information


1033
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,596
about that user, depending on


1034
00:36:15,696 --> 00:36:16,516
their web searches.


1035
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,476
So, this is another example


1036
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,786
where we get to use Differential


1037
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,796
Privacy to then, reach out to


1038
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:23,746
these developers who maybe, have


1039
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,086
issues or are writing slow


1040
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:25,506
sites.


1041
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,096
So, then we can improve the web


1042
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:27,726
for everyone.


1043
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:33,666
Now, in summary, we are all here


1044
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,256
today, and listening online and


1045
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,726
here this week in an effort to


1046
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,056
build great features for our


1047
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:39,506
users.


1048
00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:41,736
Make something that our users


1049
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:42,256
will love.


1050
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:43,896
Make something that our users


1051
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:45,846
think is fun, or maybe makes


1052
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,636
their lives easier, their jobs


1053
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:47,986
easier.


1054
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:50,826
And what I want you to take away


1055
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:52,666
from the past 40 minutes, is


1056
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,636
several techniques and concepts


1057
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,016
that you can apply within your


1058
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:56,436
own app.


1059
00:36:57,646 --> 00:36:59,526
The first one is consent and


1060
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:00,366
transparency.


1061
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:02,816
Make sure to think about what


1062
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:04,256
you're saying in your Purpose


1063
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:05,456
Strings and be clear to your


1064
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:05,856
users.


1065
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,816
Also, adopt While In Use


1066
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:09,486
location.


1067
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,496
Together, we can build a healthy


1068
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,676
app ecosystem, and DeviceCheck


1069
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:15,146
is part of that.


1070
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:18,676
We want to build a healthy web


1071
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:21,686
for everyone, and Intelligent


1072
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:23,206
Tracking Protection is a key


1073
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,276
part of that.


1074
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:27,326
With Differential Privacy, we're


1075
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:29,016
building features and learning


1076
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,326
how to build better features,


1077
00:37:30,326 --> 00:37:31,876
while protecting user privacy.


1078
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:34,356
Now, one of the great things


1079
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:36,826
about my job at Apple is I get


1080
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:37,856
to work with a bunch of


1081
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:38,756
different teams.


1082
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:40,916
And everyone's working so hard


1083
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,976
to build fantastic features and


1084
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:44,326
APIs for you guys to take


1085
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:46,376
advantage of, that will make our


1086
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,026
users be delighted.


1087
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:52,706
And that same passion, I get to


1088
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:54,936
apply and work with great people


1089
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:56,956
to apply to building privacy in,


1090
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:57,646
from the start.


1091
00:37:58,186 --> 00:37:59,756
And making sure that we all are


1092
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:01,926
building great features and


1093
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:03,386
respecting users' privacy.


1094
00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:05,796
And what I want you to take away


1095
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:06,596
from this is a bit of


1096
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:07,416
inspiration.


1097
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,416
Go home, work with the teams


1098
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,566
that you have, and go build


1099
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:12,566
great features that will


1100
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:15,176
surprise and delight, but with


1101
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,036
user privacy.

please go to this link.


1105
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:31,026
And we mentioned a lot of topics


1106
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:31,836
during this talk.


1107
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,246
And so, I'd encourage you to go


1108
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:34,546
check out some of these related


1109
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,606
sessions, including the CoreML


1110
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,056
one that's later this afternoon.


1111
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:40,046
Thank you, very much.


1112
00:38:40,046 --> 00:38:41,326
And have a great Developer


1113
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:41,966
Conference.
